Survival
Part One
MOTHER: Dave, your dinner's on the table!
DAVE: All right, Mum!
MAN: No!
MOTHER: Dave?
ACE: You had to pick a Sunday, didn't you? You bring me back to the boredom capitol of the universe, you pick the one day of the week you can't even get a decent television programme.
DOCTOR: As I recall, Ace, we came here at your request.
ACE: I just said I wondered what the old gang was up to, that's all. You didn't have to bring us here. You could have dropped me up in town. I could have phoned. I just wanted to see what my old mates were up to. You didn't have to have the guided tour.
ACE: Come on, Professor.
DOCTOR: So what's so terrible about Perivale?
ACE: Nothing ever happens here.
WOMAN: Wretched cats! Get out of my garden!! Go on, out! Out! Shoo! Shoo!
ACE: How long since I was here?
DOCTOR: You've been away as long as you think you have.
ACE: I feel like I've been away forever.
DOCTOR: Any particular reason for coming here?
ACE: It's Sunday. Some of the gang always comes up here on a Sunday.
DOCTOR: What for?
ACE: Oh, I don't know. Light a fire, muck about, you know.
ACE: Well, I told you it was dull. You don't have to hang around here. I'll meet you back at the Tardis if you want.
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure I'll find something to interest me.
ACE: Maybe they don't come up here anymore. There's no one around, is there? Nothing but tin cans and stray cats.
DOCTOR: And horses.
ACE: Horses? In Perivale? Don't be stupid.
MAN: Show me.
MAN: No. No sport for you here.
ACE: No one home. Are you really fed up?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
ACE: Do you mind if I just try down to the youth club?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
ACE: Where is everyone? Look at this.
ACE: We used to have the coffee bar here. What's happened to the coffee bar? I mean, it always was a dump, but at least you could meet people. Where is everyone?
DOCTOR: Ace?
BOY: Come on, lift his arm.
PATERSON: Well, go on. Go on, lad. What are you waiting for?
STUART: I've beat him, Sarge!
PATERSON: Oh, you think we're playing games, do you? Let's pretend, eh? Is that it? Is that what you're going to do to help some villain, some mugger? Help him up, dust him down, shake hands? Go on!
PATERSON: That's better. That's it. You all right, son?
WRESTLER 2: Yes, Sarge.
PATERSON: You sure? On your feet, then. You okay?
WRESTLER 2: Yeah.
PATERSON: Right, you go get cleaned up.  I'll be with you in a minute. Okay, lads, shake hands and we'll see you next week, okay? Bye now.
PATERSON: What?
STUART: I'd already beat him, Sarge!
PATERSON: Oh, you think I'm too hard, do you? Pushing you too hard, am I? Have you ever heard of survival of the fittest, son, eh? Have you ever heard of that? Life's not a game, son. I mean, I'm teaching you the art of survival. I'm teaching you to fight back. What happens when life starts pushing you around, son, eh? What're you going to do then?
PATERSON: That's better. You all right now, eh? You all right?
STUART: All right, Sarge.
PATERSON: Good. Off you go, then.
DOCTOR: Survival of the fittest. Rather a glib generalisation, don't you think? Survival for what, Mister er?
PATERSON: Sergeant Paterson. You show me a better way of surviving, and I'll give it a go.
ACE: Where's everyone else?
PATERSON: Who you looking for, luv?
ACE : Everyone! Everyone used to hang around here on Sundays. This was the only place you could get out of the house and out of the weather.
PATERSON : No, it's self-defence every Sunday afternoon now.
PATERSON: I don't know what happened to the waste. Don't I know you from somewhere?
ACE: I don't think so.
PATERSON: Oh, that's right. The police let you off with a warning, didn't they?
PATERSON : You were lucky.
ACE : Listen, I'm just looking for my friends, okay?
PATERSON : I don't think you'll have much luck, then.
MAN: Ah.
PATERSON: I think you'll find most of your crowd have moved on.
ACE: Moved on to where?
PATERSON: Well, I think you'd have a better idea of that than me, luv, eh? Where've you been hiding yourself?
ACE: Around.
PATERSON: Your mum had you listed as a missing person. You don't give a toss, do you? I dunno. Four kids gone missing just this month. Vanished into thin air. It's the parents I feel sorry for. Doesn't cost much to phone, luv. Ten pence, that's all.
ACE: Come on, Doctor.
PATERSON: I wouldn't be that age again if you paid me, would you?
DOCTOR: I can't remember. It's too long ago.
PATERSON: What a world to be young again in, eh? I reckon the only thing you can do is teach them to fight. That way, they'll fight or go under. Half of them go under anyway around here. Can't save 'em. Wasters.
DOCTOR: Tell me Sergeant, do you have a problem with strays?
PATERSON: Stray what?
DOCTOR: Cats.
PATERSON: I wouldn't know. It's hardly a priority around here.
ACE: Come on, Doctor!
PATERSON: Doctor, eh? You're not in the best of shape yourself though, are you? You want to build yourself up. You know, I give a class down here Monday nights for the older men.
DOCTOR: I've got to see a man about a cat.
PATERSON: Remember, keep fit and self-defence. One finger can be a deadly weapon!
ACE: Still looks the same. Dead. We were the only life there ever was around here.
ACE: I should have tried in here first, right? I wasn't thinking. Back in a sec.
HARVEY:  Take this Sunday opening? Do you think I wanna do it?
LEN:  Do you think I wanna do it? Do you think I want to give up my one day of rest to come in here and stand behind a cash register?
HARVEY: Standing behind a till all day can do your back in. I saw something about that on the news the other night.
LEN: Yeah. Law of the jungle, though, right?
HARVEY: Yeah. Survival of the fittest, mate.
LEN: I mean, all these other shops are open, aren't they? Where'd you think we'd be if we didn't join in?
HARVEY: Down the plughole. Down the plughole without a paddle, mate. Can I help you?
DOCTOR: Yes. Which do you think they'd prefer?
LEN: What?
DOCTOR: Well, these brands. Which one do you think our feline friends will find particularly irresistible?
HARVEY: Well, if you believe the advertisers, this is the one preferred by your cat connoisseur.
LEN: And that one has a taste all cat owners, who really care, put in the dish.
HARVEY: Whereas these ones have the smell that drives a tabby cat wild.
LEN: No, no, no. That's an aftershave ad.
HARVEY: Is it?
LEN: Or is it for cars?
HARVEY: All I know is, my Tiger prefers cheese.
DOCTOR: Cheese! Ah, yes.
HARVEY: It's the law of the jungle now, mate, innit?
LEN: Hmm. There are these two blokes, right? In a tent, in the jungle.
HARVEY: You got another one for me, ain't you? Go on, then, go on.
LEN: It's really dark, and they hear this terrible noise outside the tent. This terrible roaring noise. And one bloke turns to the other bloke and he says, do you hear that?
HARVEY: What?
LEN: I said, did you hear that?
HARVEY: Oh, right, yeah.
LEN: That was a lion.
LEN: And the other bloke, he doesn't say anything. He just starts putting on his running shoes. And the other bloke turns to him and says, what are you doing? You can't outrun a lion. The bloke turns to him and says, I don't have to outrun the lion.
HARVEY:  Don't get it.
DOCTOR: He doesn't have to outrun the lion, only his friend. Then the lion catches up with his friend and eats him. The strong survive, the weak are killed. The law of the jungle.
HARVEY: Oh yeah. Very clever.
DOCTOR: Yes, very clever, if you don't mind losing your friend. But what happens when the next lion turns up?
LEN: What next lion?
DOCTOR: I think you'd better get your running shoes on, gentlemen.
DOCTOR: Did you find your friends, then?
ACE: No one even remembers them.
DOCTOR: I'm sure I've forgotten something.
LEN: Oi, haven't you forgotten something?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEN: Money.
DOCTOR: No, it wasn't that.
ACE: I got lucky on the fruit machine.
DOCTOR: Lucky?
ACE: Well, they're all fixed anyway, those machines.
HARVEY: Tiger? Puss. Here, boy. Tiger? Puss. Here.
HARVEY: Len!
LEN: What is it?
HARVEY: Something's eaten Tiger.
ACE: Ange!
ANGE: Oh, hi, Ace. I thought you were dead.
ACE: What?
ANGE: That's what they said. Either you were dead, or you'd gone to Birmingham. Who's he?
ACE: Oh, a friend of mine.
ANGE: Oh. So you back to see your family?
ACE: No.
ANGE: So what you doing here? You're well out of this dump.
ACE: I just wanted to see my friends, catch up a bit.
ANGE: Oh.
ACE: So where is everyone?
ANGE: Who?
ACE: Jay?
ANGE: Dunno. Moved over west someplace. Think he's doing window cleaning, that's what I heard.
ACE: Stevie?
ANGE: Oh, he's gone.
DOCTOR: Where are they all coming from?
ACE: Flo?
ANGE: Married Darth.
ACE: Darth Vader, the brain-dead plumber? Flo?
ANGE: Yeah. Makes you think, eh?
ACE: What about Shreela?
ANGE: Oh, she's gone.
ACE: Midge?
ANGE: He's gone, too.
ACE: Gone? What do you mean, gone?
ANGE: I don't know. Gone. Vanished.
ACE: People don't just vanish.
ANGE: You did.
ACE: Yeah, well, that's different.
ANGE: Is it?
ACE: Yeah. So when did they go?
ANGE: Dunno. Last month?
ACE: What?
ANGE: Well, Midge and Stevie went last month. Shreela went last week. They had to scrape her mum off the ceiling. Funny though, I always thought she got on well with her family.
ACE: This doesn't make sense.
ANGE: That's what I said. Know what I reckon?
ACE: What?
ANGE: UFOs. They whisk 'em off and do experiments on them like we do on animals. I wouldn't fancy cutting Stevie up to see what's inside, would you? Come on, give us ten pence, then.
DOCTOR: Not a very efficient way to hunt, is it? All that noise and pantomime just to slaughter one little animal. No, if you're going to hunt, you stalk your prey. You observe it, so you can take it by surprise, and then you don't kill too many. Cover your tracks, so you don't leave a smell. Can you smell that?
ANGE: Can't. Hay fever.
ACE: What are you talking about, Professor? Is something going on here?
DOCTOR: Not sure.
ANGE: Is he?
ACE: Professor!
DOCTOR: When is a cat not a cat? When it builds its own cat flap.
DOCTOR: Bait, Ace. Bait.
ACE: Hang on, Professor!
MAN: Show me. Show me.
MAN: Yes, he'll do very well.
ACE: I can't believe he said that, you know. That T.A. twit. I reckon that was well out of order. Ten pence. I mean, even if I could've phoned, which I couldn't really, do you think anyone would've listened to me?
DOCTOR: Tin opener.
ACE: It was just that time. Just the whole crowd. We had a really good laugh. I can't believe they've all just disappeared.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Tin opener.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ACE: Are you listening to me?
DOCTOR: Quiet, Ace, I'm concentrating.
DOCTOR: No, you're not the one I'm after.
WOMAN:  What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Shush. Be quiet. Shoo.
ACE: Wow.
DOCTOR: Go on, go away! Go on! Shoo! Dog, go away!
ACE : Doctor!
DOCTOR: Ace!
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: So, they've taken you away, taken you to their planet, but I'll find you. I'll bring you back. They're not going to stop me. Nothing's going to stop me.
DOCTOR: Got you!
PATERSON: Got you! Now, what do you think you're up to?
DOCTOR: Sergeant!
PATERSON: I've had complaints.
DOCTOR: What's it got to do with you?
PATERSON: Neighbourhood watch.
DOCTOR: I've no time for that. I've got to catch that cat!
PATERSON: You're a public nuisance.
DOCTOR: Will you leave me go?
PATERSON: Now, look, don't be stupid. Don't get yourself into real trouble.
DOCTOR: One finger can be a deadly weapon.
 
STUART: Go away! Get away from here! Get away from here!
SHREELA: Ace.
ACE: Shreela!
SHREELA: Ace, you shouldn't have run. They always go for you if you run.
DOCTOR: Why don't you come out and we'll talk about this sensibly, hmm?
PATERSON: Hey, come back! Come back here!
ACE: Midge!
MIDGE: Hi, Ace. Long time.
ACE: Is Stevie here, too?
SHREELA: He was.
MIDGE: Stevie? He's cat food, isn't he?
SHREELA: Stop it.
MIDGE: This is Derek. He's doing very well. He's been here three weeks. Only got flesh wounds.
SHREELA: We'll have to move on soon. They hunt at night sometimes.
MIDGE: They can see in the dark. You can't see them, just their eyes.
ACE: Just as well I'm here. You need sorting out, you lot?
PATERSON: Got you!
DOCTOR: Get off!
DOCTOR: You stupid
PATERSON: Where the hell are we?
DOCTOR: Shut up, and we may survive.
DOCTOR: Shush, shush.
MASTER: Why, Doctor.
MASTER: What an unexpected pleasure.
Part Two
SHREELA: They don't bother us. They only eat us when we're dead. It's like they're watching us.
ACE: Yeah.
SHREELA: Come on, Ace. We're not safe in the open.
ACE: You're telling me.
MASTER: Run, Doctor. Run.
DOCTOR: Don't run!
DOCTOR: No, Paterson!
MASTER: I was relying on your intelligence, Doctor. It would be such an uncivilised death.
DOCTOR: They're just playing with him.
MASTER: They're essentially a fun-loving species. Now, Doctor, there are things I must discuss with you.
ACE: Okay, so what do we do?
MIDGE: Do? We die. Maybe today, maybe next week. We could hurry things up a bit, go and find one of those big pussy cats. That what you want to try?
SHREELA: We tried to fight one once. It caught Stevie.
MIDGE: She threw sticks at it.
ACE: Oh yeah? And where were you, Midge?
SHREELA: You can't hurt them.
DEREK: They're invincible.
ACE: Nothing's invincible.
MIDGE: That's right, Ace, you tell us. You sort us out.
SHREELA: Better get back to camp. We're not safe in the open air.
ACE: Well, are we any safer back there? At least out here in the open you can see them coming.
SHREELA: They usually don't bother us in there. They only hunt in the open, unless they're hungry, then they take us anywhere.
ACE: Why do they only hunt in the open?
MIDGE: What do you think this is, The Wonderful World of Wildlife? Who knows? Why do they always ride through here? Why do they always eat us up without ketchup?
ACE: They always ride through here?
MIDGE: So what?
ACE: So let's get one.
MIDGE: You what?
ACE: Nothing's invincible. We've got to fight back!
DOCTOR: That was a useful trick before.
MASTER: Pretty, aren't they? They're a useful distraction.
DOCTOR: Charming.
DOCTOR: Come on, pussycats! Come on!
DOCTOR: Fetch! Come on, fetch!
MASTER: I'm afraid they're not so easily distracted. They're more interested in him.
MASTER: Stay! Stay! Doctor, why don't we leave these animals to their meal?
DOCTOR: Come on, Paterson!
MASTER: No!
DOCTOR: A bit of healthy exercise, Paterson! Do you a world of good!
MASTER: Doctor, I'm warning you. I control these animals. They're mine to command. I control them!
MASTER: Very well. I'll find some other food for you.
ACE: Come on, Shreela!
SHREELA: Shush.
SHREELA: Plan B?
PATERSON: It's just not like me, you know. You ask anyone, Sarge'll keep his head in a crisis. You ask any of the lads. I don't scare easily, Doctor, believe you me.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATERSON: I was on one of those survival courses, you know, SAS style of thing. I was the only one that ate the worm stew.
DOCTOR: Very impressive.
PATERSON: But this, this is just. Where the hell are we, anyway?
DOCTOR: We're on the planet of the Cheetah People, intelligent carnivores. No one knows much about them. They don't survive long enough to find anything out.
PATERSON: You're trying to tell me we're on another planet?
DOCTOR: Yes. The trouble is, I've never heard of the Cheetah People hunting so far away from their feeding grounds before. And the kitling
PATERSON: The what?
DOCTOR: That. A kitling. A feline vulture. It's got the power of teleportation. It can jump from world to world hunting for carrion.
DOCTOR: I think we're going to be in big trouble, Sergeant.
PATERSON: You're the one who's on another planet, aren't you.  
MIDGE: He's going to get us all killed. He's going get us all killed!
DEREK: No! Get off me!
ACE: Sit down and shut up!
SHREELA: Listen!
 
DOCTOR: Ahem.
ACE: What kept you?
DOCTOR: How many times have I told you about playing with fire?
MASTER: Where are you, Doctor? What's your plan? You mustn't die.
PATERSON: Got to stick together, lads. That's the way. Stealth, that's what's needed here. Stealth and surprise. You follow me and I'll get us through this. I'm a hunting animal. I've got instinct for it.
DOCTOR: Oh, do shut up. This planet's disintegrating. According to my calculations, the safest place at the moment is over there.
DEREK: Yeah, but what about them?
DOCTOR: We have to make our way through.
PATERSON: This disintegration, you think we're going to blow up?
DOCTOR: Well, it is an old planet, a bit frayed at the edges. We'll be safe over there. Safe from the Cheetahs, and the Master.
ACE: Master? Who's he?
DOCTOR: An evil genius. One of my oldest and deadliest of enemies.
ACE: Do you know any nice people? You know, ordinary people, not power-crazed nutters trying to take over the galaxy?
DOCTOR: I don't think he's trying to take over the galaxy this time.
ACE: So what's all this in aid of?
DOCTOR: He's got some mind-link. The cats, the kitlings.
ACE: And they find things for the Cheetah People to eat.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
MASTER: Hunt him. Seek him out. Find him for me. Hurry. Must keep control. I must keep control.
DEREK: Oh!
MIDGE: No sudden movements.
DOCTOR: They won't bother you unless they're hungry.
ACE: Well, these Cheetahs look hungry.
DOCTOR: They're essentially a fun-loving species.
DOCTOR: Is it my imagination, or am I getting hot?
ACE: Doctor, I think we'd better keep moving.
DOCTOR: Yes. Quietly, gently. Just taking a nice little stroll.
DOCTOR: You see? It's all a matter of keeping your head and allowing for the unexpected.
DOCTOR: Oh no.
DOCTOR: Don't move!
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: There's one thing more dangerous than being attacked by a Cheetah, and that is attacking a Cheetah. You do not know what it will do to you!
ACE: But Doctor
DOCTOR: Don't move!
PATERSON: I'm not putting up with this. I'm not standing here and getting eaten alive!
DOCTOR: Idiot!
PATERSON: Come on, then! Come and fight!
DOCTOR: Don't' move!
DEREK: No! No!
MIDGE: Come on!
DOCTOR: Stay still!
DEREK: Help me!
DOCTOR: Don't run! Stay still!
DEREK: Help me! No!
ACE: Get off! Get off! Come on, then!
ACE: Doctor!
SHREELA: Get off!
DOCTOR: I told you to stay still!
DOCTOR: Stay still! Don't run!
PATERSON: Come on!
DOCTOR: Ace? Ace?
DOCTOR: Ace. Oh, Ace.
MASTER: Good hunting, Doctor?
MASTER: They're fighting again in the dead valley.
DOCTOR: It's breaking up.
MASTER: This planet's alive. The animals are part of the planet. When they fight each other, they trigger explosions. They hasten the planet's destruction.
DOCTOR: How long before it blows up?
MASTER: Not long. They've been fighting a long time.
DOCTOR: Why did you bring me here?
MASTER: I need your help.
DOCTOR: You're trapped. You can't escape.
MASTER: Just so. It seems the creatures of this world can't take us away from here, they can only bring us to this place.
DOCTOR: Yes. They can only return home with their prey.
MASTER: I never thought of it quite that way.
DOCTOR: But now that we're both trapped, what good is it to you?
MASTER: You'll find a way out, Doctor. You must.
DOCTOR: Why should I help you?
MASTER: It's not just death we're all facing. This place bewitches you. If we stay here, we'll be like the people who built these. They thought they could control the planet, the wilderness. They were the ones that bred the kitlings. Creatures with minds they could talk to, eyes they could see through the way I do. It only led to their corruption. We shall become like them.
MASTER: We shall become animals.
PATERSON: You all right, lad, eh?
DEREK: Yeah.
KARRA: I want water.
ACE: What?
KARRA: Want water. It will make me well very fast.
DOCTOR: Ace?
ACE: What is it? Should we leave it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: They're extremely dangerous creatures. They could eat you. Or
ACE: Or what?
DOCTOR: Worse.
ACE: What's worse?
DOCTOR: Let's just say they are dangerously attractive.
ACE: I think it's the one that chased me, that killed that boy.
DOCTOR: It could be useful to us.
ACE: You mean it could help us get home?
DOCTOR: They're hunting animals, Ace. We're their prey. They bring their prey home.
ACE: So what?
DOCTOR: We need an animal whose home is Earth.
ACE: Better keep it alive, then.
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: It could be very dangerous for you.
ACE: Don't worry, Professor. I'm no one's bowl of cat food.
MASTER: Whose home is Earth.
PATERSON: Right, you just follow the Sarge and I'll get us all through this. There's nothing I don't know about survival. It's kill or be killed, right? Kill or be killed.
MIDGE: Kill or be killed.
PATERSON: Good lad. You'll come through. We'll come through, if you just follow the Sarge. Are you with me?
MIDGE: Yes.
PATERSON: Are you all with me?
MIDGE: Yeah!
PATERSON: Well, you'd better get with me, because if we're going to survive we can't carry shirkers and we can't carry deadwood!
MIDGE:  No deadwood.
ACE: Where are the others?
DOCTOR: I don't know. We'll have to find them, and soon.
ACE: It's weird, Doctor. I think I like this place. I like it. I feel like I belong here.
DOCTOR: Connected.
ACE: I'm a bit scared. It feels exciting.
DOCTOR: What do you feel?
ACE: Like I could run forever. I can smell things as clear as pictures.
DOCTOR: Anything else?
ACE: Well, I'm starving, Professor.
DEREK : Help!
SHREELA: No!
PATERSON: Don't be a fool!
SHREELA: No! Get off him!
PATERSON: Stop it!
SHREELA: No!
DEREK: Help!
SHREELA: Leave him alone!
PATERSON: Midge!
DOCTOR: Midge!
MIDGE: He's going to get us all killed less someone sorts him out.
DOCTOR: Sorts him out?
MIDGE: Yeah!
DOCTOR: Where did you get this?
MIDGE: I killed it. I killed it.
PATERSON: Now then, son, why don't you just give me the weapon, eh?
DOCTOR: Midge! It's not too late to go home.
SHREELA: Home?
DOCTOR: Come on. We'd better follow him.
 
DOCTOR: This way.
MASTER: Go hunting. Go home.
DOCTOR: Midge!
MASTER: You see, Doctor, you did help me. You kept these others alive just long enough to serve my purposes.
DOCTOR: Midge, wait.
MASTER: Don't worry, one of these others will become a Cheetah animal before you. You can escape in your turn. Or are you too squeamish? Only the animals of this place can leave, Doctor, because they carry it with them.
DOCTOR: Midge, listen to me.
MASTER: He doesn't remember his name.  Go home.
SHREELA: So there is a way out.
DOCTOR: A way out? Yes. We wait for one of us to change and then we use them, before they try to escape or kill us all.
PATERSON: Well, there's no telling who'll be next, is there? Just get a grip and  What are you looking at? It's him, isn't it? He's the one! You stay away from me!
SHREELA: Look!
ACE: Oh, yeah. She's better. Doctor, look!
Part Three
KARRA: Come hunting, sister.
DOCTOR: Wait.
KARRA: Come hunting.
DOCTOR: No.  
SHREELA: Ace! It's happened. It's happened to her. She's changing.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATERSON: Who's next, eh? Who's next? If I had a gun
DOCTOR: We'd be in even more trouble than we are already! Right, stay here. I'll follow her.
PATERSON: Just a minute.
DOCTOR: I can leave you in charge, can't I, Sergeant?
PATERSON: Yeah, sure.
SHREELA: But what if more Cheetahs come?
DOCTOR: Stay still and try not to look like a hamburger. Don't look so glum. It could be worse. It could be Perivale.
MASTER: I will be free of it. I will be free of it.
MASTER: Ah. You are all animal now. You're so weak, your will devoured. A stronger mind will hold onto itself longer, a will as strong as mine. How much longer? If I have to suffer this contamination, this humiliation, if I am to become an animal, then like an animal I will destroy you, Doctor. I will hunt you, trap you, and destroy you.
ACE: I thought cats hated water.
KARRA: I'm not a cat. I'm Karra. I'm your sister.
ACE: No, you're not. Why do you keep calling me that?
KARRA: You're like me.
ACE: Yeah?
KARRA: You will be.
ACE: This is good. I like feeling like this.
ACE: Where's the Doctor? I've got to get back to the Doctor.
KARRA: Are you hungry? The chase.
ACE: What?
KARRA: The hunt. Smell the blood on the wind. Hear the blood in your ears. Run, run beyond the horizon and catch your hunger!
KARRA: Are you hungry, sister? Come hunting.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace, you're running, but what are you running towards?  
DOCTOR: Ace, how far have you gone? Can you come back?
KARRA: Good hunting. Good.
ACE: You kill people. You eat people.
KARRA: When I'm hungry, I hunt. When I hunt, I eat.
ACE: Would you eat me?
KARRA: There is meat here.
ACE: Yeah, but if there wasn't, would you kill me?
KARRA: How fast can you run, sister?
ACE: Fast enough.
KARRA: Ah, that would be a good hunt. Are you hungry? Come and eat.
DOCTOR: Ace! Ace, come back. Come home. Come home.
KARRA: Good hunting, sister.
ACE: What's happening to me, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's all right, Ace. We're going home.
MASTER: Look at me. Look at me. You have power now. We have power now.
MIDGE: Yes.
MASTER: You can do anything you want now. Anything.
MIDGE: Yeah!
MASTER: You're my hunting dog, Midge. The teeth for my trap. Trust me, Midge. Trust me.
MIDGE: Trust me, Midge. Trust me.
DOCTOR: Ace, listen to me. You're possessed. It's the planet, the Cheetah people. You've changed.
ACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: You're powerful, dangerous.
ACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: You can do what they do. You can carry your prey home. You can help us escape.
ACE: Yes?
DOCTOR: But if you do that, you may never change back. You'll become like the Cheetah people forever.
ACE: What shall I do? Tell me, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: The choice is yours.
DOCTOR: We're going home!
ACE: I did it. I got us back! I'm all right now, aren't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ace.
SHREELA: Perivale. We're back. I've got to get home!
PATERSON: What's your game, then?
PATERSON: So, I had a blackout. It's perfectly normal. Stress, overwork, that's all. I've had medicals. You should've got a doctor to me, though. That's the least you could've done, instead of keeping me lying about in the street. You're a doctor, right? You should know better.
ACE: Thanks, Ace. Thanks, Doctor. Thanks for saving my life, getting me back home.
PATERSON: I don't know what you mean. What are you talking about?
DEREK: Thanks, Ace. Thanks, Doctor. Thanks for saving my life and getting me back home!
PATERSON: I'm late for self-defence.
ACE: Looks like everything's back to normal, then. Well, come on, Professor. What are we hanging about for?
DOCTOR: Unfinished business.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: The Master.
ACE: Oh, he's not still around here, is he? Dump of the universe.
DOCTOR: It was you
ACE: Yeah, yeah, who wanted to come home, I know. Listen, this is the only home I've got now, right?
DOCTOR: No, it was you who brought us here, home. Therefore, Midge must have. Where does Midge live?
ACE: Who?
DOCTOR: Midge!
ACE: Oh, I don't know. He used to live in some flats over there somewhere.
DOCTOR: Come on!
 
DOCTOR: Ace!
MIDGE: Just the start, Midge. Just the start. Yeah. Yeah. I know what to do.
ACE: Are they still on the go, then? They were practically drawing their pensions when I was clubbing it.
ACE: What's up?
SQUEAK: My cat.
ACE: What happened?
SQUEAK: The bad cat killed it. The bad cat the man brought.
DOCTOR: What man? Which way did he go? Show me!
MIDGE: Waiting on the Sarge? He's been held up. He asked me to have a little chat with you. I learned a secret today. The secret of success. Thought I'd share it with you.
SQUEAK: Over there. Midge and the bad cat man. Midge went away and then he came back. He's my big brother. He's got funny eyes now.
ACE: Where's your mum, Squeak?
SQUEAK: She saw the bad cat man. He made her go away!
ACE: What's he doing it for? Why? He's escaped, hasn't he? He doesn't need to keep the Cheetahs busy. He's safe! What's he still doing it for?
DOCTOR: Malice.
ACE: Her gran's the next floor up. I'll take her. It's not just malice.
DOCTOR: Survival. Huh. It's what he lives for. He must hope, believe, he can find something.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: To destroy me.
ACE: You'd wipe the floor with him!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we are an explosive combination. One day, one of us might blot the other one out.
DOCTOR: If only I could track him down, take him by surprise before he's ready.
SQUEAK: Bad cat man.
MASTER: Ace.
ACE: He's at the youth club.
ACE: He's at the youth club. I know he is!
MIDGE: It's common sense, right? It's just the way of the world, right? Survival of the fittest. Get rid of the deadwood, let the wasters go to the wall, and the strong will inherit the earth. You and me. Do you hear what I'm saying? Do you know what I'm talking about?
MIDGE: Don't move.
MASTER: Come here. You understand me?
MIDGE: You understand me all right.
MASTER: You'll do anything I say.
MIDGE: You'll do anything I say.
MASTER: Won't you?
MIDGE: Won't you?
BOYS: Yes, sir.
PATERSON: Right, lads. Sorry I'm late. Had a wee accident, but everything's all right now. Right, come on then, let's get things moving. Let's start showing a bit of sweat.
MASTER: Why don't you take over now, Midge?
DOCTOR: So much for the SAS survival course.
DOCTOR: Where?
DOCTOR: He's chosen the time, the place, and the means.
ACE: The trails stops here.
DOCTOR: Ace.
DOCTOR: That's better.
ACE: Did I go again? I don't even feel it! I don't even feel myself go. Doctor, will I stay like this?
DOCTOR: Stay out of this, Ace!
MASTER: You are my hunting dog, the teeth for my trap, the teeth to destroy.
DOCTOR: Ace! Listen to me. Listen to me!
DOCTOR: If you fight, you'll change, you'll change completely forever!
ACE: No!
ACE: No.
MASTER: Survival of the fittest. The weak must be eliminated so that the healthy can flourish. You know what to do, Midge.
MASTER: Good boy.
ACE: I must not fight. I must not fight. Help me! Help me! Won't somebody help me?
KARRA: The chase. To hunt in the morning and live till evening. Run out of the light, and slip into the dark. Smell the blood on the wind. Hear your blood in your ears. Die at last, with your enemy's blood in your mouth. With your enemy's blood in your mouth!
MASTER: Get off the horse.
MASTER: You have no power here. This is not your place. I command here. I command you. You've no power over me. I can do anything I wish with you and you can do nothing, nothing, to me.
KARRA: Do you bleed? I can always do something to you if you bleed.
ACE: Karra!
DOCTOR: Oh, very good. Very amusing.
ACE: Karra!
KARRA: I can hunt in the dark.
ACE: I'll get you something. I'll make you well again.
KARRA: I can run into the dark. Run forever.
ACE: Just wait. I'll get you something.
KARRA: Good hunting, sister.
ACE: Good hunting.
DOCTOR: Good hunting.
MASTER: Yes. It would have been too easy. It seems we must always meet again.
DOCTOR: They do say opposites attract.
MASTER: But this is the end, Doctor. You see it. It's a power. A power from that planet. It's growing within me. Are you frightened yet?
DOCTOR: No.
MASTER: You should be. You should be. It nearly beat me. Such a simple, brutal power. Just the power of tooth and claw. It nearly destroyed me, a Time Lord. But I won. I control that force, Doctor. And now, at last, I have the power to destroy you.
MASTER: Welcome to my new home, Doctor!
DOCTOR: They've gone. What am I doing? I've got to stop. We've got to go.
MASTER: You can't go. Not this time.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can!
MASTER: Escape to what? I don't choose to live as an animal.
DOCTOR: If we fight, we'll destroy this planet. We'll destroy ourselves!
MASTER: You should have killed me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: If we fight like animals, we'll die like animals!
DOCTOR: If we fight like animals, we'll die like animals!
DOCTOR: Home.
BLONDE: Did you hear that racket? Did you hear it? Flipping cat fights all hours of the day.
DOCTOR: I think you'll find things quieting down now.
BLONDE: So you say. Flipping cats. It's the owners I blame. They want the pet, right? They want the animal, but do they keep it under control?
DOCTOR: Well, we try.
BLONDE: So you say.
DOCTOR: Mine, I believe.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
ACE: Where have they gone?
DOCTOR: They've been taken back to the wilderness. The place is different but the hunt goes on. You know all about the hunt, don't you, Ace?
ACE: I felt like I could run forever, like I could smell the wind and feel the grass under my feet and just run forever.
DOCTOR: The planet's gone, but lives on inside you. It always will.
ACE: Good. And the Master?
DOCTOR: Who knows? Where to now, Ace?
ACE: Home.
DOCTOR: Home?
ACE: The Tardis.
DOCTOR: Yes, the Tardis.
DOCTOR : There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, where the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace, we've got work to do!
