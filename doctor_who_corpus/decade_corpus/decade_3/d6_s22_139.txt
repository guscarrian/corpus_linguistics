The Mark of the Rani
Part One
DOCTOR: Must get the coordinates spot on. Yuck.
PERI: Hey, Doctor, this is great!
DOCTOR: The dress is too large.
PERI: Large?
DOCTOR: Isn't that the accepted meaning great? Synonym for large.
PERI: Spare me the lecture, please. Okay, what do you reckon? Okay for the Royal Open Day at Kew Gardens?
DOCTOR: Of course, great can also denote a high degree of magnitude. Someone elevated to power.
BASS: You coming in, Jack?
JACK: No, man. I don't think I've got the strength to lift a toby.
WOMAN: There's wise ones. First here, the water's hot and clean.
JACK: No, not wise, grandma. Just fair worn out.
JACK: Oh, stay there, will you. I've hardly got the energy to wash.
PERI: Well?
DOCTOR: Mmm, never felt better.
PERI: Wisecracks like that tell me one thing.
DOCTOR: What?
PERI: You haven't a clue what's going on.
DOCTOR: Oh, I know what's going. on. We're being manoeuvred off course.
PERI: Manoeuvred off course? You mean it isn't the Tardis malfunctioning again?
DOCTOR: Malfunctioning? Malfunctioning? Malfunctioning! After all the work I've done on it?
PERI: Well, I only asked a simple question.
DOCTOR: Indeed you did. It was the wrong question.
PERI: Well, tell me what's going on.
DOCTOR: The time coordinates are constant, it's the location that's being changed.
PERI: Being changed?
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PERI: Who by?
DOCTOR: By whom. To use your vernacular, I haven't a clue.
PERI: Well, can't you override?
DOCTOR: Don't try to be so obtuse. What do you imagine I'm trying to do? That's a time distortion, as if there's a time machine nearby.
PERI: A Time Lord?
DOCTOR: Or a Dalek. Certainly an alien force of some kind.
PERI: On Earth?
PERI: Oh, great. Some substitute for Kew Gardens.
DOCTOR: Try and look on the bright side. After all, isn't coal just fossilised plant life?
PERI: What have you got there?
DOCTOR: Tracking device. Registers time distortion. Hoist off your skirts, Peri. Off we go.
GREEN: Give it back!
JACK: Come on, now.
RUDGE: Oh, gie us a potato, man. 
JACK: You daft old bugger. What's the matter with you?
, kicks over the tray of potatoes and they all run off.)
JACK: Right, come on!
PERI: Lots of these hedgerows won't exist soon.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
PERI: I mean, in the twentieth century. They're being chopped down to improve farming efficiency. My generation's already concerned about the effects on wildlife. Some species of butterfly are almost extinct. Birds, too.
DOCTOR: Talking of birds, do you notice anything strange?
PERI: Strange?
DOCTOR: No birds.
PERI: Well, maybe it's the scarecrow.
DOCTOR: They're not usually this effective.
PERI: Well, if the place gives you the creeps, let's get out of it.
DRIVER: You finished for the day, Jack? Come on, lads, out the road. I've got to deliver this lot to pit. Come on. Whoa! What's going on here?
JACK: Come on, lads. Get that down. That's right. Get this lot off and smash it, man. Get it out, man.
DRIVER: Come here, the lot of you.
PERI: Doctor!
PERI: Here, let me help. Why did they attack you?
DOCTOR: They didn't. They attacked the machinery.
DRIVER: That's right, miss. They was after smashing up machinery.
PERI: Oh, well, I'm lost. Why would anyone want to smash machinery?
DRIVER: They're scared it'll rob them of their jobs.
DOCTOR: Maybe.
PERI: You suspect another motive?
DOCTOR: Let's say I'm keeping an open mind. Can you stand?
DRIVER: Odd that, leaving Jack Ward behind. They're usually such mates.
DOCTOR: That's an unusual mark. How did you come by that?
DOCTOR: Easy.
PERI: Hey!
DOCTOR: Hey, steady. Just trying to help.
DRIVER: What's got into you, Jack? I can't fathom it. I've never seen him like that before.
PERI: Well, so much for playing the Good Samaritan.
DRIVER: Oh, Mister Stephenson's not going to be well pleased about machinery.
DOCTOR: I don't suppose he will. Stephenson?
DRIVER: Waiting for them parts he is.
DOCTOR: George Stephenson?
DRIVER: Aye, sir. Do you know him?
DOCTOR: I know of him. Peri, how would you like to meet a genius?
PERI: I thought I already had.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course, but I haven't changed the course of history. Indeed, I'm expressly forbidden so to do. But George Stephenson will.
PERI: Could that be what all this is about?
DOCTOR: An astute observation, Peri. Can you give us a lift?
WOMAN: Here. Come here, lad. Run to tavern. Tell them as wants a bath to come right now.
WOMAN: Warn them us won't be keeping water hot much longer.
DRIVER: Whoa with it, steady, steady.
PERI: Was that significant or just a hiccup?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure. We did hit a bump just there.
DRIVER: Whoa!
DOCTOR: Why are we stopping here?
DRIVER: I'm still a bit shook up. I need a toby before I can tell pit about attack.
DOCTOR: Where would I find George Stephenson.
DRIVER: In pit, sir. Do you think you could put a word in for us. They'll be none to pleased about machinery.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes.
DRIVER: In a hurry, isn't he, miss? Does that mean something's wrong?
PERI: It does, I'm afraid, but don't ask me what. Thanks.
BASS: Hey, we're not last, grandma. T'others'll be along when they've emptied tobys.
WOMAN: Go on, in you go, lads.
MASTER: Primitive. An insult. But first things first. I've a death to arrange.
PERI: What have they got in there, coal or diamonds?
DOCTOR: Machinery. Or more specifically, George Stephenson, and he is just about
PERI: You told me. One of the architects of the industrial revolution.
DOCTOR: And I didn't exaggerate. Without his genius, your precious twentieth century would be a much sorrier place. We've got to get in there.
PERI: That's easier said than. That dog doesn't look as though it's been fed today.
GUARD: Oi! Where do you think you're going?
DOCTOR: To see George Stephenson. Where can I find him?
GUARD: Nobody gets in here without a pass.
DOCTOR: A pass? My dear fellow, I am a VIP.
GUARD: Those that are attending the meeting have a special pass.
DOCTOR: Meeting?
PERI: We've been travelling. The pass obviously never reached us.
GUARD: Then thy name will be on the list.
DOCTOR: Here, let me see that. Get that dog under control, will you? Now, what have we got? Thomas Telford, Michael Faraday, Humphry Davy. Good heavens, Peri, do you recognise these names?
PERI: I'm not totally ignorant. What is the noun for a collection of geniuses? A bevy?
DOCTOR: An inspiration of geniuses? I don't know. But I do know that the people appearing at this meeting will transform history.
GUARD: Well, that's as may be, but is thy name on the list?
DOCTOR: An oversight.
GUARD: Oh aye. A genius too, are you?
DOCTOR: I am indeed. I'm also an inventor. Look.
PERI: I must apologise. The Doctor is a little eccentric.
GUARD: A doctor, is he? Well, maybe I could have a word with the office.
PERI: Would you? Thank you.
GUARD: Harry! The gate. Bolt it.
GUARD: This way, miss.
DOCTOR: Eccentric, me? Preposterous.
GUARD: Set thee down and I'll see if I can find Mister Stephenson.
DOCTOR: I'll come with you.
GUARD: Nay. You bide here. Now sit! Stay.
DOCTOR: There's a good boy. Good. Good Fido now.
PERI: What are you up to?
DOCTOR: That's a good boy. Let the nice Doctor through.
PERI: I guess he's not susceptible to your irresistible charm.
DOCTOR: Occasionally, just occasionally, your smugness infuriates me.
PERI: Shush! Keep your voice down. Time Lords may not get rabies but humans do, and that dog looks more than ready to bite.
DOCTOR: Will you stop prattling about the dog?
DOCTOR: There's something wrong here. I'm not quite sure what it is, but I'm increasingly convinced it's got to be stopped.
PERI: You could be jumping the gun.
DOCTOR: Oh, really? Oh, that's your assessment, is it. Did you see the date at the top of that list? In less than two days from now, a meeting will take place here of many of the greatest practical talents the human race has ever produced. A coincidence?
PERI: Unlikely, I agree.
DOCTOR: Well, hanging around an office is not going to provide the answer.
PERI: I warned you to cool it.
DOCTOR: I don't think it's me.
PERI: That dog's really spooked. I wonder why? Doctor!
PERI: It's stopped.
DOCTOR: No, still functioning.
PERI: The dog, it's stopped barking.
DOCTOR: There was silence deep as death.
PERI: That's morbid.
DOCTOR: Possibly.
MASTER: You there. You were in the lane smashing machinery.
JACK: Right, never mind the machinery, what's thou doing here?
GREEN: That's easy. He's one of brainy ones arrived early for this meeting.
JACK: Aye, come to rob us of our jobs.
MASTER: Hold hard. I intend you no harm.
RUDGE: Talks funny, don't he? Hold hard? This hard enough?
MASTER: Imbeciles. Are you incapable of using your brains? What advantage do you think that'd bring you? You let the man you should have destroyed go free.
JACK: I did? What's tha on about?
MASTER: In the lane. He pretended to help you. Help? He's a friend of Stephenson's, an inventor. He's here to mechanise the mine.
GREEN: Does tha know what he's getting at, Jack?
JACK: Aye, he's just trying to save his own skin.
MASTER: Ask him. Ask him why he's trying to take the bread out of your mouths.
LAD: We'll do more than that! Where is he, dost tha know?
MASTER: He's gone into the pit.
MASTER: Let me. You can't mistake him, he's mean looking.
MASTER: Wears yellow trousers and a vulgarly coloured coat. But go carefully, he's treacherous.
DOCTOR: Careful.
PERI: Sorry. What are we doing here, anyway?
DOCTOR: Looking for George Stephenson.
PERI: Oh, he could be anywhere. Absolutely anywhere. Even underground.
DOCTOR: Peri! You really do have an extraordinary capacity for seeking out danger.
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: You ought to learn to avoid situations where
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Peri, get out of here!
PERI: But what about you?
DOCTOR: Don't argue, just go. Now, now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I'm sure we can come to some amicable understanding.
DOCTOR: Please, please.
DOCTOR: Now you've gone too far! After all the effort that went into making that!
JACK: Get him!
PERI: Get help!
JACK: Come on!
PERI: Stop it! Leave him!
PERI: Somebody help!
RAVENSWORTH: Stop that or I'll blast you to kingdom come!
RAVENSWORTH: Forget them! Haul that man up to safety, quickly!
DOCTOR: Almost at the end of my tether.
PERI: That's no joke.
DOCTOR: I can't thank you enough. But for your very opportune arrival
RAVENSWORTH: You can thank their stupidity. I'd used up the shot. It would have taken at least two minutes to reload. They had plenty of time to finish you off. Now perhaps you'll tell me who you are, and I don't want any of that flummery about VIPs. I am Lord Ravensworth, the owner. I issued personally the invitations to the meeting, and your face is not one that I recall. My office, now! VIPs indeed.
DOCTOR: Your guard is quite right, of course. We shouldn't have deceived him. But how else would we have got in here?
RAVENSWORTH: Spare me the dubious pragmatism. You came to see George Stephenson, you said?
DOCTOR: I am a great admirer.
RAVENSWORTH: Yes, you must be if you're prepared to resort to trickery. But how do I know you're not in league with these machinery wreckers, these wretched Luddites!
DOCTOR: Really, do I look like a man who would wreck machines?
RAVENSWORTH: Well, you've certainly never done a day's labour in your life, and I suppose it is possible you might even be a gentleman.  Do sit down.
GUARD: Shall we get up a search for the two who attacked this er, gentleman, my Lord?
RAVENSWORTH: No, leave them. They'll have gone to ground by now.
PERI: Leave them? They tried to kill the Doctor.
RAVENSWORTH: I don't dispute that, young woman. A brutal attack on a complete stranger. I take it you were not acquainted.
DOCTOR: Oh, I'd met the big fellow briefly when I tried to help him.
RAVENSWORTH: Yes, that'd be Jack Ward. Over thirty years he's worked for me and in all that time I've never once seen him raise his fist to another man.
PERI: Well, he's undergone a change now.
  
DOCTOR: And the disruptions only started recently?
RAVENSWORTH: Disruption's hardly the word for it. Oh, I know there have been Luddite attacks on machinery all over the country, but here
DOCTOR: It's been more extreme?
RAVENSWORTH: The violence has been horrendous.
PERI: Murderous would be more apt.
DOCTOR: Peri.
RAVENSWORTH: No, the young lady's quite right. I just don't understand what's going on. I've always had an excellent relationship with the men. Flattered myself I enjoyed their trust and respect. Now this, this nightmare.
RAVENSWORTH: They've obviously heard about the accident.
PERI: Accident!
RAVENSWORTH: Go and bring those women in here, will you?
GUARD: Yes, my lord.
DOCTOR: It's only the men that are affected?
RAVENSWORTH: Yes. They become savage, go berserk, seem to suffer a complete change of personality.
MASTER: No welcome?
RANI: You're not.
MASTER: Fascinating. But then anything connected with you would undoubtedly be fascinating, my dear Rani.
RANI: I thought that last mad scheme of yours had finished you for good.
MASTER: You jest, of course. I'm indestructible. The whole universe knows that.
RANI: Is that so?
MASTER: Really, my dear Rani, you and I should be friends. I'm one of your greatest admirers.
RANI: Oh, don't bother with flattery. I know why you're here. I saw the Doctor.
MASTER: Then you know why I need your cooperation.
RANI: Cooperation? I want nothing to do with you.
MASTER: You'll change your mind when you hear my proposition.
RANI: I am not interested in your pathetic vendetta one way or the other. Now clear off and let me get on with my work.
MASTER: If only it were that simple. However, I'm afraid you've very little choice. Either you collaborate or I bring this little venture to an extremely untimely end.
RANI: Josh, Tom, kill!
RANI: No, Josh. Stand still.
YOUNG WOMAN: Me Josh, your Lordship, been missing for days.
OLDER WOMAN: It's not just her Josh that's missing. Our Tom's gone, too.
DOCTOR: When? Forgive me, Lord Ravensworth, it is important. When did they go missing?
OLDER WOMAN: Well, nowt's been seen of them since they come off shift together.
PERI: Perhaps they joined these Luddites?
OLDER WOMAN: Join that mob of lunatics? Smashing and rampaging day and night, frightening folks out of us beds.
YOUNG WOMAN: My Josh wouldn't join them. He wouldn't harm anyone.
RANI: You and the Doctor are a well-matched pair of pests. You bring nothing but trouble. Now I need a new assistant.
MASTER: I wasn't wrong. I knew with you as controller it wouldn't be hypnotism. Not from a chemist of your calibre. What are they, parasites you've specially impregnated?
RANI: There's a simple way to find out. Why not try some?
MASTER: Thank you, I won't, but I can envisage an occasion when they may serve an excellent cause.
RANI: I was offering you one, not the lot!
MASTER: I assure you, your generosity will not be wasted.
RANI: Take him through, Josh.
MASTER: Brilliant. Quite brilliant.
MASTER: When the Time Lords exiled you, they made a cardinal error.
RANI: Yes, they did, and they'll learn to regret it. And so will anyone else who interferes!
PERI: Doctor, let's get out of here, away from Killingworth.
DOCTOR: I can't do that.
PERI: But you're in danger. That attack wasn't random. Those louts tried to kill you.
DOCTOR: Yes, but why? Aren't you interested in why they should want to make me a target?
PERI: No, not in the least. I can't think of a better reason for abandoning this visit.
DOCTOR: You're forgetting. We didn't just stumble into this place, we were hijacked.
PERI: I'm forgetting nothing. The Luddites are not our problem.
DOCTOR: I agree.
PERI: You don't think it is the Luddites.
DOCTOR: Do you? Wait here.
MASTER: You should cooperate, you know.
RANI: Take this one through.
MASTER: The Doctor won't tolerate anyone deliberately playing havoc with his favourite planet.
RANI: Can't you get it into your warped skull that there is nothing deliberate about it? The aggression is an unfortunate side effect.
MASTER: Unfortunate? Fortuitous would be a more apposite epithet.
RANI: Call it what you will, I need the chemical. The only source is the human brain. It can have no relevance to you or your machinations.
MASTER: Ah. But then, as yet you've not been appraised of my purpose in being here.
RANI: To destroy the Doctor. You've never had any other. It obsesses you to the exclusion of all else.
MASTER: You underestimate me. Certainly I want to destroy him, see him suffer, but that is just an exquisite first step. I have a greater concept, one that will encompass the whole human race.
RANI: You're unbalanced. No wonder the Doctor always outwits you.
RANI: Put that down!
MASTER: You don't get much, do you.
RANI: There's only a minute amount in each brain.
MASTER: How does extracting this make humans more aggressive? I'll not ask again.
RANI: Because without that chemical, the brain cannot rest.
MASTER: Ah, now I understand. You need it for your aliens on Miasimia Goria. I dropped in on your little domain before following you here. Chaos. Complete mayhem. What went wrong?
RANI: Wrong? Who said anything went wrong?
MASTER: Well, you rule there absolutely. I assume one of your little schemes didn't turn out quite as you expected.
RANI: A small matter. In the process of heightening the awareness of my aliens, I lowered their ability to sleep. They became
MASTER: Difficult to control. On the other hand, with this and the impregnated parasites, their talents are yours to command. Oh, such power. Is that a scanner?
RANI: Find out.
RANI: Who do you want?
MASTER: The Doctor.
RANI: Where did you see him last?
MASTER: At the pit.
DOCTOR: Hold on a minute, will you?
RAVENSWORTH: What the blazes are you doing, man?
DOCTOR: All right, thank you.
RAVENSWORTH: Well, did you hear me? What was all that about?
DOCTOR: Later. You said that the son of one of my attackers worked for you?
RAVENSWORTH: Yes, Luke Ward, George Stephenson's assistant. Very capable young man. My prot�g� as a matter of fact.
DOCTOR: Find him for me, will you, there's a good chap.
RAVENSWORTH: The dratted man's a positive law unto himself.
MASTER: You see? We do have an allied cause. Unless you eliminate the Doctor, he'll bring this cosy operation to an end.
RANI: Then let's get on with it.
MASTER: My way. We do it my way. Any idea where those morons you created might be?
MASTER: Ah, the old mine working.
RANI: What are you going to do?
RANI: The brain fluid?
MASTER: It's perfectly safe. Next to my hearts, both of them.
RANI: Wait!
RANI: Let go of me!
MASTER: Not until you tell me what this is.
RANI: They're capsules for my lungs. The Earth's damp atmosphere affects them. Do you trust anyone?
MASTER: Yes. Myself. Capsules they may be, but don't touch them till this door closes between us.
DOCTOR: And your father was perfectly normal this morning?
RAVENSWORTH: The lad's already told you he was.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Bear with me. The answer's probably staring me straight in the face. I just can't see it.
PERI: When did you last talk to him, Luke?
LUKE: When he came off shift. He were on his way to bathhouse.
DOCTOR: Bath? Bathhouse?
LUKE: Well, to get cleaned up like.
PERI: Doctor, when we went past
DOCTOR: Luke, can you find me an old coat?
LUKE: Aye, but
RAVENSWORTH: Go on, bring him one.
PERI: Doctor, when we went past the bathhouse, that instrument of yours
DOCTOR: Reacted. Yes, I know. I said the answer was staring me straight in the face, didn't I? It was, literally.
PERI: I don't get you.
RAVENSWORTH: I'm glad it isn't just me.
DOCTOR: Those men didn't look as if they'd come straight from the mine, did they? They were clean.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Luke.
RAVENSWORTH: Is he often like this?
PERI: Too often. Excuse me.
PERI: Well, now what's going on?
DOCTOR: I am about to follow what you would term as a hunch.
PERI: Must you? Okay, where do I fit in?
DOCTOR: You stay here where you'll be safe.
PERI: Safe? I haven't been safe from the moment I first found myself in the Tardis.
DOCTOR: How do I look?
PERI: Like a man who could do with a bath.
RANI: No, wait. Let him come further in. I told you to wait, you cretins. Wait! The man's armed. Now!
RANI: My phial. The fools will smash it.
MASTER: The mark of the Rani.
JACK: Is he dead? Why, I don't understand what's happened.
MASTER: I warned you that inventor was treacherous.
JACK: But he's not nowhere near.
MASTER: Ah, he doesn't have to be. He has a machine to do his foul work for him.
JACK: A machine?
MASTER: Yeah. I'll show you.
RANI: What's he up to now?
RANI: It'll be something devious and overcomplicated. He'd get dizzy if he tried to walk in a straight line.
RANI: Come on in, come on in. Towels are all ready there.
JACK: What's that, a coffin?
MASTER: An appropriate description. A coffin, yes. No, it's the machine that murdered your friend.
JACK: That thing?
MASTER: To be buried in the deepest mine shaft.
JACK: I can't see no point in burying a box. Better I bury him.
MASTER: Trust me, I give you my word. By destroying that, you'll divest him of all his power.
JACK: Does tha know where it is?
MASTER: At the slag heap. Hurry, fetch it to the pit.
JACK: Wha? Fetch it? No, tha's coming with us.
MASTER: No, not me. That's just the bait. I have to return to the village to set the trap.
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. The Rani.
RANI: You were expecting to see the Master?
DOCTOR: To see? Not exactly. He was burnt to a crisp the last time I saw him.
RANI: Your smugness is misplaced. He's here. He's very much alive and he wants vengeance, curse the pair of you.
DOCTOR: Well, since we're insulting each other, I can't say I care much for your taste in clothes. Doesn't do a thing for you.
RANI: Hmm, your regeneration's not too attractive, either. But at least I can change my appearance. You're stuck with what you've got.
DOCTOR: My face is of no importance. Brain regeneration is what I need. I should have been able to pin this one down to you. Personality changes, probably due to an imbalance in body chemicals. Yes, you're the obvious culprit. Well, you had me fooled, if that's any consolation.
RANI: It isn't.
DOCTOR: You'd have been discovered eventually, you know, even without my intervention.
RANI: I never have.
DOCTOR: Oh? This isn't your first visit?
RANI: I've been coming to this wretched planet for centuries.
DOCTOR: Without being discovered? Well, I'm impressed. You've obviously a brilliant tactician as well as a brilliant chemist.
RANI: Oh, it isn't difficult. These humans you so admire are a feckless lot, always in disarray. The Trojan wars, the Dark Ages, the American War of Independence.
DOCTOR: And now the Luddite riots.
RANI: Perfect cover.
DOCTOR: Cover, yes, but for what? I think I've got it. You're extracting a chemical from the brain. The result is the victims become violent, aggressive, can't rest? That's it. The chemical that promotes sleep.
RANI: I begin to understand why the Master finds you such a menace. Oh, where is the idiot?
DOCTOR: I take it you're referring to the Master. Look, why don't you release me?
RANI: What, and have you two stop my work?
DOCTOR: These are human beings, Rani. Living creatures that have done you no harm.
RANI: They're carnivores. What harm have the animals in the fields done them? The rabbits they snare, the sheep they nourish to slaughter. Do they worry about the lesser species when they sink their teeth into a lamb chop? Ah! Josh, guard him.
DOCTOR: Josh?
RANI: If he moves, kill him. No, don't kill him. Kill this one. Touch�, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Don't hurry back.
PERI: Doctor? I know you're here. I'd have seen you leave.
PERI: Doctor?
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Stop!
PERI: Stop? What do you mean, stop? I was going to free you.
DOCTOR: Don't come any further. Touch me and their orders are to kill.
PERI: But I can't just, I mean, I must do something.
DOCTOR: You can. Get that poor fellow out of danger.
PERI: Well, how?
DOCTOR: Use some of that famous American initiative. Push him outside.
PERI: But won't they try
DOCTOR: Their orders relate only to me. Now move, Peri.
PERI: Orders? Whose orders?
DOCTOR: For once will you forget the cross-examination and just go?
RANI: Who's this brat?
MASTER: My dear Rani, quite unwittingly you've made my triumph utterly complete. Allow me to introduce the Doctor's latest travelling companion, Miss Perpugilliam Brown, although her travelling days will soon be over.
PERI: I thought he was dead.
MASTER: As you observe, I'm very much alive. Your erstwhile mentor, on the other hand, is about to, I believe your modern expression is, snuff the candle.
DOCTOR: Snuff the candle? You always did lack style.
MASTER: Style is hardly the prime characteristic of your new regeneration.
RANI: Oh, do stop squabbling and get on with it.
MASTER: I have a score to settle with Miss Peri first. When we last met, you could have saved me and you didn't.
RANI: No, don't kill the girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Rani. I'm glad to see you haven't sunk to quite the Master's depths.
PERI: No, let go of me!
RANI: Oh, be still. Human.
MASTER: So?
RANI: Her brain's as good as anyone else's.
MASTER: No comment, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Don't think I could stand it.
PERI: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: A hyperactive Peri. Too ghastly to contemplate.
PERI: I don't understand.
MASTER: We're being treated to an example of his famous sense of humour. I'm afraid, Doctor, that even that will desert you soon.
JACK: Go on, Jackie, go on. Push, lads!
MASTER: A turbulent time, Doctor, in Earth's history.
DOCTOR: Not one of its most tranquil, I agree.
MASTER: A critical period.
DOCTOR: You could say that.
MASTER: Oh, I do. The beginning of a new era.
PERI: Doctor, do you get his drift?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid I do, Peri.
PERI: He wants to pervert history.
DOCTOR: Not that the Prince of Darkness here would see it as perversion.
MASTER: Maudlin claptrap. The talents of these geniuses should be harnessed to a superior vision. With their help, I could turn this insignificant planet into a power base unique in the universe.
DOCTOR: And you intend to use the Rani's bag of tricks to achieve this egocentric scheme.
MASTER: You are indeed a worthy opponent. It's what gives your destruction its piquancy.
MASTER: Excellent! Feast your eyes, Doctor, on the imminent demise of the Tardis.
PERI: The Tardis!
MASTER: Finito Tardis. How's that for style?
PERI: Oh, Doctor, if they destroy the Tardis
DOCTOR: Very clever. Optical illusion created on the screen. I've tried that but never succeeded.
MASTER: It's no illusion.
PERI: Hope you're right, Doctor.
RANI: He's not.
DOCTOR: Believe me, I am. The Rani's cleverer than any of us. She's managed to modify that scanner so it presents what's in the mind instead of what's happening in reality.
MASTER: Push.
PERI: The trolley?
MASTER: One false move.
PERI: Well, push where?
MASTER: Outside!
RANI: No. He doesn't leave here.
MASTER: I wonder how many weeks of work this represents and how many of the Doctor's precious humans have contributed.
RANI: Do as he says.
MASTER: You shall have the girl when we return. Push, unless you prefer a swifter end.
JACK : Right, to the pit, lads! Good on yer, lads. That's it.
MASTER: The last rites, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I can't really see from this far away.
MASTER: You can hear.
DOCTOR: I gather they're going to throw it down the pit.
MASTER: All the way down, to the bottom.
JACK: Put the brake on, Billy. Hold it there. Right, lads.
JACK: Push now!
DOCTOR: Push, Peri! Push! Push! No, no, Peri! The other way!
DOCTOR: Peri!
PERI: Doctor!
PERI: Hold on, Doctor, I'm coming!
JACK: Why, look up there, lads. Get hold of this, lads.
DOCTOR: Thank you, gentlemen. I'm most grateful. If you could just
DOCTOR: Peri! Stay back!
JACK: We've got you now. That's it, put him on there, lads.
DOCTOR: Stay back!
JACK: Right, push lads. Away we go!
Part Two
STEPHENSON: Are tha hurt? Harmed at all? 
DOCTOR: No.
JACK: Hold it, Jackie.
JACK: Come on, Jackie.
DOCTOR: A trifle cramped.
STEPHENSON: Ah, tha would be.
DOCTOR: It's these straps.
STEPHENSON: Aye, I suppose. Intriguing.
DOCTOR: The straps? Oh, it's a long story.
STEPHENSON: Hey, this metal. I've ne'er seen the like of it afore. Dost know what foundry forged it?
DOCTOR: George Stephenson, I presume?
STEPHENSON: Aye, I'm Stephenson.
DOCTOR: Absolutely delighted to meet you, sir. If you'd be so kind as to undo the straps?
STEPHENSON: Of course. Forgive me. T'were metal that took me attention.
PERI: Run, Doctor, run!
DOCTOR: Stephenson, we've got to get away.
STEPHENSON: Follow me.
RAVENSWORTH: Here, take this. Round up all the able-bodied men you can find and search this pit. I want every one of those scoundrels hunted down.
RAVENSWORTH: You, pull yourself together, man, and get back on the gate. Nobody enters or leaves. That's an order!
LUKE: Mister Stephenson!
STEPHENSON: Shush.
DOCTOR: Somewhat unorthodox entry.
STEPHENSON: Owner's notion.
DOCTOR: Lord Ravensworth?
STEPHENSON: Aye. He thought we'd best be prepared lest the Luddite riots started here. Seems he were right.
DOCTOR: Except these weren't Luddites.
STEPHENSON: They're not?
DOCTOR: That's what you were supposed to think.
STEPHENSON: Then why did they attack thee?
DOCTOR: Thought I was attending this meeting of yours.
STEPHENSON: For that they were prepared to kill thee?
DOCTOR: Afraid so. Not just me, either.
STEPHENSON: What? Tha means Davy, Faraday and t'others are in danger? I find that difficult to credit.
DOCTOR: You disappoint me. A practical man, and yet you refuse to believe the evidence of your own eyes?
PERI: It's not the first time they've tried to kill the Doctor.
LUKE: Aye, tis truth, Mister Stephenson.
STEPHENSON: Oh. Dost thou think we should cancel meeting?
DOCTOR: Don't you?
STEPHENSON: Pity. I suspect thee's contribution would have put cat or two among pigeons.
PERI: Oh, Doctor, now that's sorted out, don't you think we should do something about trying to get to the Tardis?
DOCTOR: When it's safe.
LUKE: When the Doctor were attacked again.
PERI: Yes, Luke?
LUKE: Was, did me father take part?
LUKE: I asked me mam about that red mark on his neck. She'd ne'er seen it. She knew nowt about it. Do you know what caused it?
STEPHENSON: Right, Luke, take this to his Lordship.
LUKE: Aye. Dost mind if I also seek me da?
STEPHENSON: Course not, lad.
DOCTOR: Luke, be careful. Your father's not the man he was.
STEPHENSON: Oh, I'd nay like anything happen to Luke. Lad's got great future. I was down pit at nine. Never had much schooling. But Lord Ravensworth's seen to it that Luke's been well taught. He'll outshine me.
LUKE: Hey, Tim! Tim Bass! Has't tha seen me da?
BASS: He'll want nowt to do with thee, Luke. Not as long as tha's working with that Stephenson.
LUKE: But why? He's nay objected afore.
BASS: Aye, he do now. Assistant? Traitor more like. Out of the road.
MASTER: Excuse me, young man. I've been summoned here by Lord Ravensworth. Can you tell me where I might find him?
RANI: Be careful. Josh, help him.
MASTER: Luke, I want you to swallow this very special sweetmeat.
MASTER: Splendid.
MASTER: Thomas Telford, Michael Faraday, Humphry Davy, Marc Brunel. An impressive role of honour. Luke, this meeting is not to be cancelled. Do you understand?
LUKE: I understand.
MASTER: If anyone tries to prevent it, you destroy them. Is that clear?
LUKE: That is clear.
MASTER: Anyone. Anyone at all.
STEPHENSON: The key is more power. Now, if I can increase that, speed of fifteen, even twenty mile and hour will be possible. Now, power is the problem.
PERI: Doctor, there is a more pressing problem.
DOCTOR: Peri's right. I'll talk to you later, Stephenson. Come on.
DOCTOR: My dear fellow.
JACK: Ready? Follow me.
PERI: Do
GUARD: Let the lass go or I'll blow your brains out.
PERI: Doctor!
GUARD: Jack Ward, you stay where you are!
DOCTOR: You do make a mess of that pretty dress.
PERI: But how?
DOCTOR: Peripheral vision,
RANI: At last you're back, you incompetent egoist. Give me my phial.
MASTER: This? The precious brain fluid? And I thought you were waiting for me.
RANI: If I didn't need that desperately, I'd have put light years between us.
MASTER: What better reason could I have for keeping it?
RANI: You'll play that card once to often. With you on the scene, I might be wiser to cut my losses and go.
MASTER: Perhaps this will make you change your mind. Read it.
RANI: The meeting's been cancelled?
MASTER: No, it was never delivered.
RANI: Well
MASTER: You disappoint me. A scientist and you're not thinking objectively. Davy, Faraday, Telford and others. Over twenty men of genius. Have you no conception of what we could achieve if we control them? Harness their genius, and this planet could become the platform for the most devastating power in the universe.
RANI: You're forgetting, I already rule a planet. Miasimia Goria.
MASTER: Help me, and I promise you all the facilities you need. Instead of sneaking back here in disguise, you'll be able to set up a laboratory and process as many humans as you choose. A hundred, a thousand, there are millions of them.
RANI: What guarantee would I have?
MASTER: My need. That unique box of parasites will not go far. Only you have the formula.
RANI: The Time Lords will never permit it.
MASTER: Who's going to alert them?
RANI: Indeed. We must hurry.
MASTER: Haven't you overlooked something? You can hardly take them out onto the streets.
RANI: No, you're right, I can't.
MASTER: The Mark of the Rani.
GUARD: I caught these two, my lord.
RAVENSWORTH: Only two? What about the others?
GUARD: I don't know, my lord.
RAVENSWORTH: They must have got away. Confound it.
JACK: Good luck to them.
RAVENSWORTH: Be quiet, Ward! My orders were to round up the whole lot of them.
JACK: We haven't finished yet.
RAVENSWORTH: I said that's enough.
GUARD: Drop that, Jack, or I'll blow thee to pieces.
RAVENSWORTH: Now sit on it. My mistake's been trying to deal with this rabble myself. I should have sent for the militia long before now. Tie them up.
STEPHENSON: Tha's delivered note?
LUKE: Aye.
STEPHENSON: What's his Lordship say?
LUKE: Nowt.
STEPHENSON: Shouldn't think he were too well pleased. Happen I should have gone meself, explained. In t'office, is he?
LUKE: Nay. Tha stay put. I'll fetch him to thee. Tis safer that way.
STEPHENSON: Thanks, Luke. Tha's a real thoughtful lad.
RAVENSWORTH: Ah, Luke. I want to have a word with Stephenson about this meeting.
LUKE: He's nay in t'workshop, your Lordship.
RAVENSWORTH: No? Where is he then?
LUKE: Down pit. Wanted to arrange for visitors to see demonstration. What about meeting, my lord?
RAVENSWORTH: Well, in my opinion it should be called off. All this uncontrolled violence. We have no right to subject these men to such danger.
LUKE: Mister Stephenson don't see any danger.
RAVENSWORTH: He doesn't?
LUKE: Going to be fair disappointed he is if meeting doesn't take place.
RAVENSWORTH: Why?
LUKE: Eager to show off his latest engine.
RAVENSWORTH: Well, that's somewhat selfish reasoning.
LUKE: Not if he's convinced they'll come to nay harm, your Lordship.
RAVENSWORTH: He's convinced, you say?
LUKE: Aye.
RAVENSWORTH: Yes, well, George Stephenson has always enjoyed my complete trust. On his head be it. However, be sure to tell him what I say.
LUKE: Aye. I will.
PERI: Oh, Doctor, you can't be serious. You've only just escaped from there!
DOCTOR: The victim returns to the scene of the crime.
PERI: Look, Doctor, let's be sensible. Concentrate on getting the Tardis out of the pitshaft, instead of shoving our necks into the noose again.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PERI: Look, what if the Master and that awful Rani are inside?
DOCTOR: They won't be.
PERI: How can you be so sure?
DOCTOR: Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once.
PERI: And what about that other piece you're so fond of quoting? Discretion is the better part of valour?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Interesting fellow, the Bard. Must see him again sometime. Ah ha!
DOCTOR: Control panel? Most unsophisticated. Not worthy of the Rani.
PERI: Is he? The Master.
DOCTOR: No, more likely the Rani's handiwork. No, don't come any further. The Rani's quite capable of leaving some very unpleasant surprises behind.
PERI: Well, where do you reckon she's gone?
DOCTOR: Not far. The Master will ensure that. He has something she wants.
PERI: That red mark. What was she going to do to me?
DOCTOR: Drain the substance from your brain that enables you to sleep.
PERI: The result. Those poor men. Hasn't she any conscience?
DOCTOR: Like many scientists, I'm afraid the Rani simply sees us as walking heaps of chemicals. There's no place for the soul in her scheme of things.
MASTER: Why the devil did you bring us to this miserable dump?
RANI: I didn't bring you. You chose to come.
MASTER: Why here?
RANI: Because this was my original base.
MASTER: Did we have to walk? Couldn't we have used your Tardis?
RANI: My Tardis is performing a more important function.
MASTER: Is it too much to enquire what that function might be?
RANI: Yes.
PERI: How come you know the Rani?
DOCTOR: Same way as I know the Master.
PERI: But he's an exiled Time Lord.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Two of a kind. Odd. Very odd.
PERI: What is?
DOCTOR: Now, I would have said Turner's too passionate for the Rani's sterile taste.
PERI: Well, I guess she must have thought so too, since she hasn't taken it with her.
DOCTOR: Ah ha.
DOCTOR: Shall we?
PERI: Shall we what?
DOCTOR: See if we've misjudged the Rani.
DOCTOR: Dichlorodiethyl sulphide!
PERI: Dio what?
DOCTOR: Mustard gas. It's a killer!
PERI: I know.
DOCTOR: Don't breath it in. Whatever you do, don't breath it in!
DOCTOR: Masks.
PERI: Masks?
DOCTOR: The Rani's assistant.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you, Peri. Street door.
PERI: Street door?
DOCTOR: Open it. Ventilation. Quickly.
PERI: Okay.
PERI: Hey, that's the key to the Tardis!
PERI: But suppose the Rani's in there! Oh, no.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Embryos of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. She must have popped back to the Cretaceous age and picked up a few. Nasty creatures. Vicious teeth. Bite your leg off, chew it all up, bone and all, all in one go. Wonder what she wants with them?
DOCTOR: Peri, get out of here!
PERI: But you
DOCTOR: Don't argue. Move!
PERI: Oh.
PERI: Doctor! Oh. Oh, now where's he gone?
DOCTOR: Incredible. Absolutely incredible. A Tardis linked to a Stattenheim remote control. The Rani is a genius. Shame I can't stand her. I wonder if I was particularly nice to her, she might? No. No, no, of course not.
MASTER: Brilliant. You've discovered the means of operating a Tardis by remote control. In tandem, you and I will rule the universe.
RANI: Shall we go inside?
MASTER: Do I detect a lack of enthusiasm?
RANI: Grandiose schemes of ruling the universe will mean nothing if that dilettante Doctor is still at large.
DOCTOR:  Dilettante?
RANI: The dratted man.
MASTER: Don't tell me you've botched something. What did you do, leave a trap for the Doctor? Is that why we couldn't use your Tardis?
RANI: Here, take these.
MASTER: It's power was needed to operate the
RANI: Be careful.
MASTER: What are they?
RANI: Well, let's say that they'll change the Doctor's lifestyle.
MASTER: How? Will he suffer?
RANI: Well, I can promise you he'll never be the same again.
MASTER: Excellent. Why not kill two birds with one stone?
RANI: Who's the other one?
MASTER: George Stephenson.
RANI: How will that threaten the Doctor?
DOCTOR: How indeed?
RANI: I saw you give my parasites to Stephenson's assistant. I presume you gave him enough?
MASTER: Yes, he's completely under our control.
GUARD: Doesn't seem right, does it, my lord, seeing Jack Ward like this.
RAVENSWORTH: No. That Doctor fellow, he was on to something. Strange sort of chap. See if you can find him.
GUARD: Right, my lord.
GUARD: No sign of that Doctor, my lord, but I met his bonny lass.
RAVENSWORTH: Devil take you. It's the Doctor I wanted to see.
PERI: Well, that makes two of us.
RAVENSWORTH: You must have some idea of his whereabouts.
PERI: Oh, must I? He could be anywhere in the universe.
RAVENSWORTH: Make sense, girl. Calm down and think. He can't just have disappeared.
PERI: Oh, can't he?
RAVENSWORTH: The man must be found. We need his help.
PERI: I've more reason to find him than you have, otherwise I'm going to spend the rest of my days prancing around in these ridiculous skirts.
GUARD: I'd better go with you, lass. They'll never let you past the gate.
PERI: Don't bother. I'll take the back way to the old pit. It's the one place he'll have to return to, if he has any choice.
RAVENSWORTH: No, leave him be, leave him be. Get back on duty. And if you see young Luke, tell him we've got his father here.
GUARD: Right-o, my lord.
STEPHENSON: Oh! Tha startled me, Luke. You should know better than to creep up on folk. Tha's been wandering off a lot today, Luke. Why is that?
LUKE: It's Mister Faraday. There's been an attack.
STEPHENSON: Faraday? He's here in pit.
LUKE: Nay, his coach were overturned.
STEPHENSON: Is he hurt?
LUKE: Scared more like. Hiding out in Redfern Dell. Reckon tha should go to him, sir.
STEPHENSON: Tha dost? Make gun ready, Luke.
PERI: I could have been stuck in the eighteen hundreds for ever.
DOCTOR: Did you really believe I'd abandon you?
PERI: So, what happened?
DOCTOR: Later. Where's Stephenson?
PERI: Haven't got a clue, but Lord Ravensworth wants to see you in his office. Ask him.
STEPHENSON: Give me that, Luke. Go to office. Tell his Lordship I'm off to Redfern Dell. I want as many men as he can spare. Make haste. Tis urgent.
DOCTOR: There's nothing I can do. These men need rest.
RAVENSWORTH: Rest?
DOCTOR: They've been robbed of the power of sleep.
RAVENSWORTH: Robbed of the power? Oh, confound it, man, I don't understand what you're talking about.
DOCTOR: I haven't got time to explain now. Peri, stay here. See what you can do.
DOCTOR: Ah, Luke. I'm looking for Stephenson. Do you know where I can find him?
LUKE: Nay, sir.
RAVENSWORTH: Didn't he give you any idea where he'd be?
LUKE: Nay, my lord.
RAVENSWORTH: None at all?
LUKE: He never said nowt.
RAVENSWORTH: Now what's he up to?
DOCTOR: You expecting trouble?
STEPHENSON: Like as not. Got a message from Faraday. He's taken shelter in Redfern Dell.
DOCTOR: Message?
STEPHENSON: He's been attacked.
DOCTOR: Luke brought you the message.
STEPHENSON: How'd you know that?
DOCTOR: Stephenson, it's not safe for you out there. Let me go.
STEPHENSON: But Faraday?
DOCTOR: If he's out there, I'll bring him to you. I promise.
STEPHENSON: Tha'd best take this.
DOCTOR: Oh, no thanks. I've given them up. Guns can seriously damage your health, you know. Another thing. I can't explain but it is important. Don't trust Luke.
LUKE: Perhaps sleeping draught's the answer.
PERI: Well, at least it would sedate them.
RAVENSWORTH: Could you prepare one?
PERI: If I had the right herbs. Trouble is, I know absolutely nothing about the plant life in this area.
RAVENSWORTH: Well, I might be of some use to you there. I'm something of an amateur botanist myself. Ah.
RANI: If you value your miserable skin, keep clear.
PERI: That's what I need, valerian. Do you know it?
RAVENSWORTH: Valeriana officinalis. Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. It's an indigenous herb.
LUKE: Happen I can assist, my lord? Take Miss Peri to collect herbs?
RAVENSWORTH: Excellent idea, Luke. Just be careful where you go.
PERI: Yes, we don't want to bump into any of those
RAVENSWORTH: Quite, quite. But don't worry, young lady, you'll be in safe hands with Luke.
LUKE: I was thinking of Redfern Dell, my lord.
RAVENSWORTH: Splendid, splendid. I couldn't have suggested a better place myself. Now off you go.
PERI: Oh, will you tell the Doctor where I've gone?
MAN : Hurry, lads. Here we are. Come on, then.
MASTER: How much longer are you going to be?
RANI: Be patient. Stay calm.
MASTER: I've waited too long for this moment to be calm. If you knew how often the Doctor's gone out of his way to sabotage my plans.
RANI: Except on this occasion he didn't go out of his way, did he? You contrived to get him here. Force the Tardis off course, did you? Overrode the controls?
MASTER: Do you think this plan will work?
RANI: I don't make mistakes.
MASTER: If that were true you'd still be on Gallifrey. Ugh.
RANI: Experiments are always subject to the unexpected. They can be capricious.
MASTER: Capricious? Turning mice into monsters?
RANI: A marginal error, quickly corrected.
MASTER: The Time Lords didn't think so.
RANI: Petty spite on the part of the Lord President, just because they ate his cat.
MASTER: Took a chunk out of him, too, I remember. Pity it wasn't the Doctor.
RANI: That will soon be remedied.
DOCTOR: Will you come into my parlour? Said the spider to the fly. I think not. Doesn't feel right.
MASTER: I'd feel happier if I could see him.
RANI: A sentiment he'd reciprocate. We stay here, out of sight.
PERI: Can't go wrong if you match the leaf.
LUKE: Aye, but let us not waste time here, Miss. I'm sure I've seen it's likeness in Redfern Dell. This way, Miss.
DOCTOR: No!
MASTER: So much for your arrogant superiority.
DOCTOR: A characteristic you both share. Underestimating your opponents. Well, I got your message. I'm here. What obnoxious fate have you devise?
RANI: Why me?
DOCTOR: Because he blamed you for its failure. Not this.  Far too simple. No, you'd have brewed something much more malignant. Perhaps the answer's down there in the dell, where I was supposed to go.
MASTER: No! An accident. It wasn't intended for him.
DOCTOR: And you're so warped, so callous, you think that justifies it? First you turn an innocent young man into your acolyte, force him to betray his friends, and then you do this monstrous thing to him.
RANI: Oh, stop being sentimental. What's happened? Animal matter has been metamorphosed into vegetable matter. So what?
DOCTOR: You'll be telling me next he's better off.
RANI: As a matter of fact, he is. A tree has four times the life expectancy of a human being.
DOCTOR: They should never have exiled you. They should have locked you in a padded cell. Now move, before I forget my abhorrence of violence and use this.
DOCTOR: Don't move, Peri! Don't move! The tree won't hurt you!
DOCTOR: Now perhaps you'll accept there are more things in heaven and earth than are ever dreamed of in your barren philosophy.
RANI: And perhaps you'll accept that you face a dilemma.
MASTER: More of an impasse?
DOCTOR: Wrong on both counts. There is no impasse, and the dilemma, Rani, will be solved by you. You laid those evil contraptions in the dell, so you can lead Peri out. Refuse, and I won't hesitate to use this.
MASTER: She can't remember. She's probably set them at random.
DOCTOR: I doubt if the Rani ever did anything at random.
MASTER: But if she has, what then?
DOCTOR: Then you're nominated as understudy. I should think you'd turn into a laburnum tree.
MASTER: Laburnum? Why?
DOCTOR: The pods are poisonous. Be patient, Peri. Stay absolutely still.
RANI: Come to me. Keep an absolutely straight line.
PERI: I don't understand.
RANI: Stop bleating and do it.
DOCTOR: Keep exactly in her footsteps, Peri!
RANI: Incompetent fool! You're worthless!
DOCTOR: Not to me, she isn't. You'll do well to remember that.
PERI: She was going too fast.
RANI: Can you jump without falling on your face?
PERI: Sure.
RANI: Well, copy me and you're out of danger.
PERI: What was that all about?
DOCTOR: You wandered into a minefield of the Rani's making.
PERI: A minefield? In there? But Luke? What about Luke? Where is he?
DOCTOR: He just saved your life.
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: I'll explain later. Right, move, you two. I want you off this planet before you commit any further atrocities.
PERI: Doctor, look.
RANI: They're easily disposed of.
DOCTOR: Give me that.
RANI: If they see you, they'll have no mercy.
DOCTOR: Maybe not.
PERI: Doctor, they're heading towards the dell.
MASTER: The wood's about to become populated with new trees.
RANI: Another dilemma. One of morality.
MASTER: And we all know the Doctor's dedication to morality.
PERI: Oh, Doctor, you've got to stop them.
PERI: Don't worry, I won't have any qualms about using this.
DOCTOR: All right. Take them to the old mine working, straight along that path. Wait for me there.
PERI: Okay, you got it.
PERI: Now hurry. Okay, you two. Let's get going. And don't try anything, either of you.
DOCTOR: Stop!
BASS: Mister.
PERI: Okay, that's far enough. Now don't move. We'll wait here for the Doctor.
DOCTOR: You must listen. You are making a terrible mistake. I am not your enemy.
BASS: You hear that, lads? Mister Inventor says us are making a mistake.
MASTER: I believe an apology is in order, Miss Brown. I meant you no harm. My quarrel's with the Doctor, not you.
PERI: What about Luke?
MASTER: Luke?
PERI: Did you mean him no harm?
MASTER: That was her idea.
RANI: Oh, stop grovelling. No one's going to believe you've got a conscience.
MASTER: You can see what she's like. It was her doing. I didn't even know what she'd planned.
PERI: Put that away or I'll use this. The Doctor said you'd try to hypnotise me.
RANI: Oh, so that was what he whispered before he left.
BASS: Over there.
DOCTOR: Turn back! Turn back! You're walking into a trap!
PERI: Keep your hands by your side.
RANI: Just getting a tablet. I must have a tablet.
MASTER: She'll have a seizure. I've seen it happen before.
PERI: Oh, for pity's sake, get the tablet. But carefully. No tricks.
DOCTOR: Stay calm. Stay calm. It's only a matter of balance.
MASTER: Wait. I refuse to run away and let that crack-brained freak win again.
RANI: Then stay, but without me.
MASTER: Have you no pride?
RANI: Pride? I'm a scientist. I've calculated the odds, and they and not idiotic pride dictate my actions.
MASTER: You intellectual microbe. Slave to a computer? He'll be back. He won't abandon the girl.
RANI: You'll never learn, will you. Give me the brain fluid. I'm off.
MASTER: When I'm ready, not before.
DOCTOR : Peri?
DOCTOR: Peri. Peri!
PERI: Oh, the Rani. Tablets. My, my fault.
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Are you all right?
PERI: Yes, I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Shush. Listen. Typical. He's decided to stand and fight. Why couldn't he just leave? All right, come on. We've got to get those two into the Rani's Tardis.
PERI: Any chance of an explanation?
DOCTOR: Later.
PERI: Doh, later. That's all I ever get. Later.
DOCTOR: There was a loose one.
PERI: Where?
DOCTOR: Further in.
PERI: All these mines look the same to me. What does that solve?
DOCTOR: Stay back, Peri.
MASTER: Quickly! You'll destroy us both.
RANI: I will? You blame me?
RANI: You wouldn't be told.
MASTER: What is it? What's wrong?
RANI: It's our speed. It's increasing.
MASTER: Then reduce it!
RANI: You asinine cretin, what do you imagine I'm trying to do?
PERI: But what's to stop them materialising at the other end of the village?
DOCTOR: While I was in the Rani's Tardis I made an adjustment or two to the navigational system and velocity regulator.
PERI: But they're Time Lords. They'll repair the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Not before they're beyond the Milky Way. For that matter, beyond most galaxies. I've heard that conditions are very primitive in the outer reaches of the universe. Hardly the setting for an harmonious relationship.
MASTER: It's growing!
RANI: It's the acceleration! Time spillage!
MASTER: We're trapped, you blundering woman!
DOCTOR: And where are you going?
PERI: The sleeping draught, remember?
DOCTOR: Taken care of. I managed to
PERI: Pick the Master's pocket when you bumped into him.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Take this to Lord Ravensworth, will you?
PERI: Well, let me deflate your swollen ego and remind you of something we don't have. The Tardis.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
RAVENSWORTH: I wonder what the blazes this thing is?
STEPHENSON: Ask the Doctor.
RAVENSWORTH: Have you ever tried asking the Doctor a question?
DOCTOR: Ah! Battered but not bowed. Thank you.
STEPHENSON: Had to get it out manually. No easy task. Forty of us.
PERI: Ah, there you are. The sedative you wanted.
RAVENSWORTH: Thank you.
PERI: Well, haven't you any questions?
RAVENSWORTH: Would there be any point?
DOCTOR: Not much.
STEPHENSON: Oh, as a man of science, Doctor. This valve's a problem.
DOCTOR: You'll find the answer.
RAVENSWORTH: My sentiments exactly.
DOCTOR: And when you do, your invention will take off like a rocket, Stephenson.
PERI: Oh, those puns get worse.
DOCTOR: Really? I thought they were improving.
RAVENSWORTH: I will venture just one question, Doctor. What precisely do you do in there?
DOCTOR: Argue, mainly.
STEPHENSON: Where've they gone?
RAVENSWORTH: Where indeed? You know, I always said he was a strange sort of fellow.
