Vengeance on Varos
Part One
ARAK: Not him again.
ETTA: Yeah.
ARAK: ComDiv must be running short of people to laserise.
ETTA: Yeah.
ARAK: Rubbish. He's not hurt, he's only acting.
ETTA: Never.
ARAK: Is this all?
ETTA: It's what they sent.
ARAK: How can I work, dig on this? It's not enough to fill a clinker-mole's belly, let alone a working man's.
ETTA: There's shortages, maybe more to come.
ETTA: Governor's punch-in vote tonight.
ARAK: Voting, voting. This Governor calls a punch-in every time he wants to change his trousers. The sooner he gets ruled out, the better.
ETTA: What would the next one do different?
ARAK: Everything. Anything. What is this I'm eating, Etta?
ETTA: How should I know? I just get it out the dispenser. It didn't have a label on it.
ARAK: Get off. I want to chuck it at the screen when your beloved Sir Governor begs my vote.
ETTA: Attacking ComTec property can bring loss of viewing rights. Way you're thinking, you'll be in that one's place.  I'd like to see how far you get in the Dome of Punishment. You'd not even survive the first distort section.
ARAK: Marriage to you prepares me to survive anything. Why have they stopped? Oh, it's pathetic. When did they last show something worth watching, eh? When did we last see a decent execution.
ETTA: Last week.
ARAK: What?
ETTA: The blind man.
ARAK: That was a repeat.
ETTA: It wasn't. You're thinking of that infiltrator. He wasn't blind. Not at the beginning, anyway.
ARAK: Yes, he was. I'm going to sleep, anyway.
ETTA: Can't. You've got to vote.
ARAK: Do it for me.
ETTA: Do you want PolCorps calling here? Do you, Arak?
ARAK: How would they know it wasn't me voting?
ETTA: I'd tell 'em.
DOCTOR: That's it.
PERI: I don't believe it.
DOCTOR: I haven't told you what I've done, yet.
PERI: You sound confident. I don't want to know.
DOCTOR: What is the matter with you?
PERI: Every time you sound confident nowadays, something terrible seems to happen.
DOCTOR: Does it? What do you mean?
PERI: Well, since we left Telos, you've caused three electrical fires, a total power failure, and a near collision with a storm of asteroids. Not only that, you've twice managed to get yourself lost in the Tardis corridors, wiped the memory of the flight computer and jettisoned three quarters of the storage hold. You even managed to burn dinner last night.
DOCTOR: I have never said I was perfect.
PERI: If you recall, last night I was supposed to have a cold supper.
DOCTOR: That was an unfortunate accident.
PERI: Before each and every unfortunate accident, you've said in a loud, confident voice, that's it. And to be honest, Doc, I am getting tired of clearing up the mess and being thrown around the Tardis like the teddy bear of some psychotic baby.
DOCTOR: Have you finished, Perpugilliam?
PERI: For the moment.
DOCTOR: It's a good thing I like you.
PERI: Right now, the feeling isn't mutual.
DOCTOR: What more do you want? I've cleared up as you requested. I've stabilised the chameleon circuit.
PERI: So now what will we materialise as?
DOCTOR: A police box. I think.
PERI: Well, better than a pyramid or Nelson's column.
DOCTOR: We have never materialised as Nelson's column!
PERI: We did as a pyramid. On the frozen plains of Ewa Nine, remember?
DOCTOR: It's a good thing I'm a tolerant man, because sometimes you push me too far.
PERI: You're the most inconsistent and intolerant man I've ever met.
DOCTOR: Intolerant?
DOCTOR: Intolerant?
DOCTOR: Intolerant? Me?
PERI: Then why are you shouting?
DOCTOR: Because
DOCTOR: There's something wrong.
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: Shush. There's something amiss in the power transmission system.
PERI: Still? After all the work you've done?
DOCTOR: It's the one area I didn't check.
PERI: Oh, great. Aren't there emergency power circuits or something?
DOCTOR: It seems that function is about to become defunct too.
PERI: Terrific.
DOCTOR: The problem is, Peri, we are faced with a conundrum wrapped up in a dilemma.
PERI: What exactly does that mean?
DOCTOR: We could very well be stuck in a limbo of space and time.
PERI: For how long?
DOCTOR: Eternity.
SIL: You're a reasonable man. Lower the price of your commodity a little, please.
GOVERNOR: My people deserve fair prices for the Zeiton-7 ore.
SIL: Who else will buy from you if my corporation withdraws its contract?
GOVERNOR: We shall have to find other outlets, I should think.
SIL: You are not a rich planet. Zeiton is all you have to sell.
GOVERNOR: There are other exports. We're expanding into entertainments and communications with some success.
SIL: How?
GOVERNOR: The Punishment Dome. We sell tapes of what happens there.
SIL: Ah, that is enterprising. Your idea, Governor?
GOVERNOR: Yes.
SIL: Are they very disturbing, these videos you sell?
GOVERNOR: They show what befalls those who refuse to obey the orders by which the people of Varos must live.
SIL: Torture? Blindness? Executions?
GOVERNOR: All the functions of the Punishment Dome are recorded as warnings to miscreants everywhere.
SIL: But they entertain as well as instruct?
GOVERNOR: You must ask my Chief Officer. He is responsible for ComTec Division product.
SIL: I will hope to help organise your sales exports, if you consent to lower your Zeiton price.
GOVERNOR: I can't. I'm sorry.
SIL: Then my patience is exhausted and spent totally.
CHIEF: The people are anxious for a decision on the new price of our product.
GOVERNOR: Negotiations between ourselves and Galtron Mining are far from complete. The broadcast must be delayed.
CHIEF: Impossible. The rules must be obeyed by Governors as well as prisoners.
GOVERNOR: What is the difference?
CHIEF: What point have you reached, gentlemen?
SIL: Stalemate, on contract, royalties, everything.
CHIEF: But surely, a little movement regarding cost?
SIL: Already I have gone beyond my authority to meet the stubbornness of this Governor.
GOVERNOR: We must have an increase of price. We must.
SIL: I will wait. Perhaps the next Governor will be more sensible of reality.
GOVERNOR: I am the Governor. You deal with me.
SIL: But tonight you must place yourself at the mercy of the votes of your people. Should they not agree with your stubborn stance, you may be obliterated.
CHIEF: He is right, sir.
GOVERNOR: I am not afraid to die. My family have served and perished at the will of the people. Now, if it is my turn, so be it.
DOCTOR: That's interesting, not to say arresting.
PERI: Where are we?
DOCTOR: Neither here nor there.
PERI: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Somewhere. Let's see.
DOCTOR: Stalled, in the equivalent of a galactic lay-by. See?
PERI: No.
DOCTOR: Midway between Cetes and Sculptor. Materialised into actual and temporal void.
PERI: Yes, but why won't it move?
DOCTOR: This is the one problem the Tardis cannot overcome. Like all things in the universe, she cannot move without power and energy.
PERI: Yes, Doctor, but we can. Don't give up, please.
DOCTOR: It's all right for you, Peri.
PERI: Me? Why is it okay for me?
DOCTOR: You've only got one life. You'll age here in the Tardis and then die. Me, I shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent.
SIL: Like this Governor we do not. Replace you must arrange most soon. That is what our secret payments to you are for.
CHIEF: My dear Sil, a little patience is all that is required. Trust me.
SIL: Do you think he suspects the truth of matters?
CHIEF: No, he simply wants a better deal.
SIL: Maybe I should dispense with your payoffs. Perhaps I should offer that and you to him.
CHIEF: You simply really mustn't threaten me. You need me for what you hope to gain here.
SIL: If I do not succeed one way, I favour another. Enough talk. I would wish to witness the suffering moments of this fool Governorship.
CHIEF: I'm sorry. Sil refuses to increase his offer.
GOVERNOR: In a few moments, I have to appear before ViewPol. Propose further austerities, food dole, work feed cuts. They won't accept it. The vote against me will be overwhelming. We know what that will do.
CHIEF: The Constitution requires that Governors who fail to please the majority must suffer. It is the price of failure.
GOVERNOR: Even until death. I wish I had something to offer the people of Varos. Something to give them hope.
CHIEF: Bend the truth a little. Imply you intend to squeeze a few million extra credits at the Galatron negotiations, and if you don't, well, fools have short memories.
BAX: You must make ready for the broadcast, sir.
GOVERNOR: Yes, yes, yes.
GOVERNOR: Good evening.
GOVERNOR : For centuries, the Galatron Mining Corporation has declared rich dividends by exploiting our labour. Now is the time to steel ourselves for sacrifice, to gain what is ours by right.
GOVERNOR : As always, I seek ways to market the resources of our poor planet
ARAK: Blah, blah, blah. Get to the point.
ETTA: Shut your mouth.
GOVERNOR : Seven credits per unit of zeiton ore mined is what I asked.
ARAK: Well, you won't get it.
ETTA: One more yak out of you, Arak, and you're down on my ViewStat report as a subvert.
GOVERNOR : Surely that is not too much to ask.
ARAK: I'm entitled to an opinion.
ETTA: Entitled to a vote is all.
ARAK: I know how I'll use that, then.
GOVERNOR : Viewers of Varos, I ask that we agree to hold out for what is a fair price for our principal marketable resource, that of zeiton ore. Those who wish to fight alongside me for a prosperous tomorrow, vote Yes to a ten percent reduction of our food rations. Those who wish for full bellies today and nothing to eat tomorrow have the option to punch their No button.
ARAK: Right.
ARAK: He's lost! Go on, pour it on and on.
ETTA: No, no.
ARAK: Yes, he's going. Yes, he's snuffed it!
ETTA: Has he?
ARAK: Oh. Well, next time. Next time for sure.
ETTA: He's strong. That's three losing votes in a row!
ARAK: Yeah. Next vote will see him blasted out for sure. No one's ever taken four bashings from that cell disintegrator thing.
ETTA: I wish you'd leave him alone.
ARAK: Why? He's the worst Governor we've had since. Well, since
ETTA: Since the last one?
SIL: Is the Governor no more?
BAX: He survived. Just.
SIL: We must arrange good riddance of this bad Governor soon.
CHIEF: He is weakened by the human cell disintegration bombardment. Engage him in negotiations now and you may gain advantage.
GOVERNOR: Permission to leave Governor's domain.
CHIEF: Congratulations, sir. You survived the vote.
SIL: Soon, your death will be apparent. You will see. Should we try again to reach agreement before I must communicate with my executive council?
GOVERNOR: Later.
SIL: Now or never!
GOVERNOR: Give me a moment or two.
SIL: Very well. Transport me to the office of the Governor.
SIL: I find the G-forces of this Varos size world quite excessive.
GOVERNOR: I'm so tired.
CHIEF: I warned the people would not accept yet more rationing cuts for whatever the reason.
GOVERNOR: This system of referendum, how much longer can I survive?
CHIEF: One more vote?
BAX: Governor, may I suggest you do something to please, to entertain, to please the people. Just to give yourself time to recover your strength. Why not give them the life of the rebel Jondar? After all, it's his death or yours.
GOVERNOR: It would have to be something different.
BAX: I thought perhaps by laser obliteration, sir, by a concentrated build-up of power. Neutralise the Q switch. That way, the random laser emitter builds up to a giant pulse of light, an explosion of focused laser energy that would wipe the prisoner out of existence.
GOVERNOR: We have never shown that style of despatch.
CHIEF: Too quick. It would be over too soon. We'd never be able to sell so swift an execution.
BAX: It's the uncertainly. No one knows quite when the power will blow. We could get at least ten minutes of tension out of his apprehension and fear.
CHIEF: It's novel, I suppose.
BAX: I'm sure the video of his execution would sell. You said we must export or die.
GOVERNOR: Yes. Yes, I did. Very well, arrange it. And Bax
BAX: Sir?
GOVERNOR: Thank you for the suggestion.
BAX: End random pulses. Conserve CB. Neutralise Q switch. Activate viewer warning of imminent public execution.
QUILLAM: Bax.
BAX: Sir?
QUILLAM: The idea for the random laser obliteration, did that come from you?
BAX: Yes, Mister Quillam.
QUILLAM: Well done. New variation of execution is always welcome.
BAX: Thank you, sir.
QUILLAM: I'll bear you in mind when my rehabilitation section's reorganised.
BAX: Thank you, sir. I'd welcome a chance to work with you in prison research.
QUILLAM: Ah, Chief. What of the seditionist's woman? Does the Governor require shots of her witnessing her husband's obliteration?
CHIEF: He didn't ask for them.
QUILLAM: No sense of theatre.
CHIEF: Shall I order it?
QUILLAM: Oh, no, no, no. I have other delights in store for that lady.
PERI: Here, a little something to stop you sighing like a steam engine.
DOCTOR: What is it?
PERI: Tardis manual. I found it in the workshop propping open a vent.
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. Started reading that once.
PERI: Hey! Won't that tell you what's wrong with the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Huh, I know perfectly well what category of disaster has befallen us.
PERI: The comparator?
DOCTOR: No. No, not this time. Might as well confirm my diagnosis. Something to pass eternity with, I suppose.
PERI: Doctor, the column moved!
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah? Probably some vestigial power passing through to the transitional elements. Which would mean
DOCTOR: Where are we?
PERI: What is it?
DOCTOR: Yes. Hold that. Don't lose the place. And don't give up hope. Not yet.
PERI: Yes, Doctor.
GOVERNOR: Another attempt will be made to obtain better terms for the mining of our resources. One other pronouncement. As Governor, I hold final say as to the appeal against sentence of death. The rebel Jondar, although enduring his pre-execution ordeal well, must nevertheless suffer the fate of all who transgress the rules of our society.
GOVERNOR : At eight o'clock, then, attend to your screens to witness what must befall all who oppose the reality of our just constitution.
RONDEL: The order for your husband's execution has just been received.
ARETA: When is it?
RONDEL: Soon.
ARETA: Jondar was your friend.
RONDEL: Before he rebelled against orders.
ARETA: Curious to see how the life of a guard has changed you.
RONDEL: I can do nothing.
ARETA: Rondel! Do you know what he found, what he saw?
RONDEL: No. Please!
ARETA: While the rest of us toil without hope, the officer elite enjoy power and luxury.
RONDEL: Lies!
ARETA: Varos is what is always was. A prison planet, a colony for the criminally insane. The descendants of the original officers still rule, by fear, with the spectacle of death our only entertainment. That is what Jondar found, what he learnt. That is why they want to kill him.
RONDEL: I must leave.
ARETA: Can't we make an attempt to save him? Rondel, please.
RONDEL: It's too late.
DOCTOR: TR reading from the IV table.
PERI: Is that in the hypertime ratio section.
DOCTOR: Where else?
PERI: Er, orthoganal reading is Zee S plus 101 EQ.
DOCTOR: Zee? Oh, zed.
PERI: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well, that's as it should be. The power conversion factor is stable, so why aren't we receiving full transmission of that power? There's a possibility. May I?
PERI: What is it?
DOCTOR: Let me see. Yes, we might. We'll try. Hold that.
PERI: Doctor, it's working!
DOCTOR: With the last vestiges of our emergency power booster. Enough for a limited flight, no further. The thing that depresses me most of all is that the transitional elements have lost the capacity to generate orbital energy and should be, must be, replaced.
PERI: How long would that take?
DOCTOR: No time at all. If we can obtain enough zeiton-7 to reline the transpower system, the Tardis will be like, well, as she was. No, it's not the fitting that's the problem. Zeiton is a very rare element. It's only to be found on one planet.
PERI: Well, let's go there, then.
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh. I suppose if we use the emergency power booster to bypass the failing circuits, we could just reach the planet of Varos in the constellation of Cetes. Question is, when? If we miss their mining era, we'll be stranded for evermore.
PERI: Well, anything's better than being stuck here.
QUILLAM: What's inside that skull? Anger? Fear?
ARETA: Hatred of you, Quillam.
QUILLAM: Ah, but hatred of yourself as well. We all have some parts of our mind that we consider unworthy, some memory that makes us shudder and squirm. Do you know what my process of transmutation does? It focuses on the seeds of fear in your mind and makes them grow until you, your body, your face, your entire being, transforms into the image in your mind. You should turn into something quite interesting. A reptile, or something simian perhaps.
ARETA: Or something truly loathsome, such as you.
QUILLAM: Take her to the rehabilitation unit.
RONDEL: Sir.
CHIEF: For sedition, thought rebellion, and incitement of other rebels to organise, to unionise and to terrorise the workforce of Varos, the vote of the people was for your death to take place by laser obliteration.
JONDAR: The Governor was to consider my appeal!
CHIEF: Our Governor bows to the will of his people. As Systems Arbiter and Chief Officer, I confirm that the conditions of the Constitution have been complied with. I therefore permit your execution to proceed.
JONDAR: When will this be, Chief Officer?
CHIEF: At eight o'clock. You have ample time to compose yourself for eternity. All of five short minutes.
CHIEF: It isn't exactly certain when obliteration takes place. Stand clear of the execution site. You have your anti-hallucination helmet?
MALDAK: Yes, sir.
CHIEF: Good. Switched on?
MALDAK: Yes, sir.
CHIEF: Good. We wouldn't wish for one of my guards to succumb to the phantoms of the Punishment Dome. Not with all of Varos watching.
MALDAK: No, sir.
DOCTOR: Ah, who's this coming to welcome us?
MALDAK: Control. Senior Guard Maldak 239. Report of fault on anti-hallucination helmet. Am experiencing sensory distortion. Permission to withdraw?
CHIEF : Stay until after execution.
MALDAK: Understood.
PERI: Artificial atmosphere, enclosed, underground, breathable.
DOCTOR: With distorted readings from a nearby power source.
PERI: What kind of place is this, Doctor? Why did that man fire at us and then turn away as if we didn't exist?
DOCTOR: Let's go and ask him.
BAX: Sir, Chief, there's something wrong.
CHIEF: Be quiet!
BAX: But we
CHIEF: Attend to your function!
SIL: Silence! Execution is imminent.
GOVERNOR: What is it?
SIL: This is the most wonderful entertainment.
DOCTOR: Hello.
PERI: Hi!
DOCTOR: Not interrupting anything?
MALDAK: I know how this place works. I know you are but a product of my mind, and I choose to resist you to know that you cannot exist.
DOCTOR: Quite right.
MALDAK: Control, Control, my anti-hallucination switch is suffering malfunction. Permission to withdraw.
DOCTOR: That's what we've come to fix. Isn't that right, Peri?
PERI: Yes, sure.
DOCTOR: Let me have it. Come on. Give it to me now.
PERI: Doctor, careful!
DOCTOR: Thank you.
SIL: Is this planned?
GOVERNOR: Certainly not. What's happened?
CHIEF: I'll alert the IR squad immediately, sir.
BAX: Sir, there's another group
CHIEF: Yes, thank you, we have seen.
GOVERNOR: Are they rebels?
BAX: I don't know.
GOVERNOR: We must, we must act.
SIL: They must be apprehended, sentenced, executed. All of them!
GOVERNOR: Attend to it.
CHIEF: Sir. Bax!
BAX: Sir.
SIL: My company is only interested in stable situations.
GOVERNOR: Varos has been stable for more than two hundred years.
SIL: See you remain so, or a most unfavourable report I will give!
GOVERNOR: I, I'm
SIL: Help him.
SIL: Now, my dear friend, what is good price for your zeiton-7 ore?
GOVERNOR: Seven credits per unit. Seven. I'm so, so tired.
SIL: Seven credits a unit, when the engineers of every known solar system cry out for his product to drive their space-time craft? A planet of fools who don't realise their luck and don't deserve to. Return to our craft. Alert the Council to have a colonising force sent to this sector.
SLAVE: Right.
SIL: When I control this planet, I will possess the means of power throughout this entire galaxy! And, perhaps, for all others beyond.
JONDAR: Help me! Whoever you are, quickly!
DOCTOR: Peri, pull his away from the wall.
PERI: Like this?
DOCTOR: That's it. Right, hold. Close your eyes and wish for luck. Here we go.
DOCTOR: Right, now the other one.
JONDAR: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Let's get back to the Tardis, I'll explain there.
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Then again, retreat another way might be a more viable idea.
PERI: They're too close.
DOCTOR: Help me turn this round.
DOCTOR: Right.
DOCTOR: Come on!
CHIEF: Kill laser connection!
ARAK: Run! Run! Go on, run!
DOCTOR: It's a dead end.
JONDAR: I can't go on much further.
PERI: Nor me.
DOCTOR: What is this place?
JONDAR: An ordinary prison once, but now. There's a patrol car coming. I'm sorry, I thought there was an escape cell down here.
DOCTOR: Let's create a little difficulty for our uniformed friends, shall we?
JONDAR: Why should you want to help me?
DOCTOR: You're the only person we've encountered so far who hasn't tried to destroy us. Help me. Pull! Pull!
DOCTOR: Ah! Right, let's see what I can do with this. Stand back.
CHIEF: Where's that emergency lighting?
DOCTOR: If you insist.
PERI:  This way.
ARETA: I thought we'd lost you. They set up your execution so quickly we couldn't even stage an attempt at a rescue.
JONDAR: I thought he was sent by you.
ARETA: No.
DOCTOR: I will explain. I'd sooner leave whatever this place is and get back to the safety of the Tardis, er, ship.
JONDAR: Spaceship?
PERI: Something like that.
ARETA: Rondal's agreed to help us escape through the guard's entrance.
RONDAL: We must leave straightaway.
DOCTOR: First, I want to know what this place is.
JONDAR: This place is where the innocent are tortured as the population gloats over our efforts to survive.
RONDAL: Not all enjoy. Some of us seek to help.
ARETA: For every Rondal there are thousands of Varosians slumped over their wall screens, deadened by overwork and starvation.
DOCTOR: Starvation? But Varos has precious mineral deposits. Zeiton-7.
JONDAR: That stuff. Who wants it?
DOCTOR: I wouldn't say no to a little.
RONDAL: We must go.
ARAK: Great! Great, they're getting away!
ETTA: Yeah, but wait till they meet the guards at the end of the tunnel.
ARAK: Nah, they'll be all right. This batch of rebos are good.
ETTA: I like that one, the one in the funny clothes.
DOCTOR: Back.
DOCTOR: All these cameras, do they feed pictures from here into every home?
JONDAR: The whole dome is wired. Areas of ingenious danger lurk in every corner. You can die in so many varied and spectacular ways.
ARETA: The cruel thing is that there is supposed to be safe route leading towards an exit. Freedom.
DOCTOR: If we can get back to the Tardis, we can get away from here much more easily.
JONDAR: How?
PERI: You find a way back to the Tardis and then the Doctor'll be delighted to demonstrate.
ARETA: Do you know where we are?
JONDAR: Near the purple zone, next to the interrogation and execution area.
ARETA: Is there another way to get back to his spaceship?
DOCTOR: Tardis.
JONDAR: Not without traversing the purple zone.
ARETA: Then we're trapped. Good as dead.
DOCTOR: Not yet. Let's see what this purple passage has to offer.
JONDAR: Is he sane, this Doctor?
PERI: Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Peri, this is no time for casual conversation.
PERI : Coming.
DOCTOR: We must pass through quickly. Quickly! The guards might return any time.
JONDAR: Come on. We must try.
ARAK: Oh, I like this section. I wonder if they know what's waiting.
ETTA: This'll sort them out.
DOCTOR: Of course, that's it. Close your eyes.
PERI: I can't.
DOCTOR: Close them. Now! Right, now all take hands. That's it. Now, follow me. It's just an illusion.
DOCTOR: Come on, but whatever happens, keep your eyes closed.
SIL: He's not a fool, your intruder.
BAX: Perhaps just lucky.
CHIEF: Or he has received information on how the dome works. There was a guard helping them.
BAX: The prison contains too many devices. No one could know or survive them all.
SIL: They do not seem or act like Varosians. They could be from a rival company! The Amorb-Prospect Division. I would want the strangers removed for questioning.
CHIEF: Get me a line to patrol headquarters.
BAX: Yes, Chief.
SIL: Then check on that object found near the execution chamber. Have it brought here at once!
DOCTOR: All clear.
PERI: Oh, what was that thing we saw? A creature from my worst imaginings.
DOCTOR: It might in fact. Ah ha! There we are.
ARETA: A gee-jee fly? But it was huge!
DOCTOR: We thought it was. That little fly was enlarged by the effect of the purple zone on our visual cortex. Once the purple light was eliminated, we were restored to a proper sense of proportion. Interesting.
PERI: Is everything we experience here like that?
JONDAR: No, some dangers are very real. The crowd loves to watch trialists face a danger they believe to be imaginary. The viewers applaud and shout with laughter as we poor fools walk towards certain death.
DOCTOR: Who loves to watch?
JONDAR: Almost all of Varos. It's the way the officers divert discontent, questions, thoughts of revolution.
DOCTOR: Oh. Let's see what else this fun palace has to offer.
PERI: Oh, what a stench. Phew!
JONDAR: Animal.
DOCTOR: Real or imaginary? Just as loathsome. The niff at least is not an illusion. Or is it?
JONDAR: Just like ComTec design to put a real monster immediately beyond an imaginary one.
DOCTOR: Or is that exactly how they would expect us to reason. One way to find out.
PERI: No, Doctor!
{Areta holds Peri back as the Doctor walks towards the green eyes.)
DOCTOR: It's all right, they're lights. Green lights, two of them.
BAX: The ViewPop like them. We've received very good punch-in appreciation figures.
CHIEF: Good. All the more impact when they are captured, tried and executed. A rebo leader, and his woman, and intruders from another world. That's not only prime time viewing here, but the recording of their final agonies will sell on every civilised world.
PERI: The Tardis should be
DOCTOR: Just here.
DOCTOR: It was just here.
ARETA: Your ship has gone?
DOCTOR: It most certainly has.
JONDAR: Where?
PERI: Yes, Doctor, where?
DOCTOR: Well, it can't be far away. Hmm. Come on.
SIL: This mysterious most is.
CHIEF: There's an explanation. The strangers will be captured soon, then we'll force some answers.
SIL: Who are other people helping rebels? If he should be of another mining corporation, our contracts are ended.
GOVERNOR: No, he is unknown to us.
SIL: I would wish them dead. Only that would please my company.
GOVERNOR: Close them out, Chief. Use every guard available. I'll talk to the people. Arrange it quickly.
BAX: What about this?
GOVERNOR: Keep trying to open it.
PERI: All these corridors look the same to me.
DOCTOR: Check down there.
JONDAR: Shush. There's a patrol car coming. Quick!
PERI: Doctor, look out!
GUARD: There's one!
ARAK: They've had it now.
MALDAK: Make a fool of me, would you? Take her to the Prison Control Centre. The others, to the termination cell.
ETTA: Oh, dear. And I really liked him.
GOVERNOR : Good evening.
ARAK: Oh, no. What's he want?
ETTA: Shut up and listen.
GOVERNOR: I must report that the attempt to divert the course of justice has been repelled. The rebel and his compatriots have either been captured or destroyed. The extent of the rebellion is greater than feared, and help from another source, perhaps from another world, is suspected. The vehicle of their transport is now in the possession of my officer guard. The leader of the invaders is at this moment walking into a no-options kill centre. There he will suffer the fate of all who seek to overturn the law of Varos.
GOVERNOR: I ask you to vote now upon my campaign to halt insurrection. I await your verdict. Yes, and the rebellion will be crushed. No, and no doubt another Governor will have other plans.
GOVERNOR: Thank you.
PERI: Drink, Doctor? Drink, Doctor. Drink water. Drink water.
DOCTOR: Peri!
CHIEF: What a wonderful thing a man's mind is. The hallucinatory inductor makes him believe he cannot survive, and soon he will be unable to draw one breath after the next.
ARAK: Have we got anything to drink?
PERI: Doctor!
GOVERNOR: Keep quiet! We're recording. The moment approaches. Close up on death throes, please.
BAX: No sign of life, sir.
SIL: Dead as death!
BAX: How long should I hold?
GOVERNOR: And cut it, now.
Part Two
PERI: You animals! What have you done to the Doctor?
CHIEF: Show her.
PERI: No, I don't believe it. He can't be dead.
GOVERNOR: I'm afraid he is.
PERI: You did it. You killed him.
GOVERNOR: Not really. He had an hallucination that he was lost in a desert. His mind thought he was dying of thirst.
SIL: His body agreed, so die they did.
PERI: What is that thing?
CHIEF: Show some respect.
GOVERNOR: Now, tell me, the dead intruder was called the Doctor?
CHIEF: So who are you?
SIL: Answer. Answer. Answer!
ARAK: Why do they keep showing that stiff?
ETTA: They know what they're doing.
ETTA: Ah!
ARAK: What?
ETTA: He moved!
ARAK: Reflex.
ETTA: Maybe he isn't fully dead.
ARAK: Then he soon will be. Here comes the acid bath.
ETTA: Oh, I hate this bit.
ARAK: They always do that. It's to show the acid's highly corrosive.
ETTA: Shut up.
CHIEF: Who are you?
PERI: You wouldn't believe me.
SIL: You agents of Amorb are!
PERI: I don't know what that is or even what he says.
GOVERNOR: Sil's language transposer has an eccentric communication circuit. But, don't tell him, it's my only amusement.
CHIEF: Don't upset the Galatron delegate, please. We need that agreement to sell the zeiton ore to his company.
GOVERNOR: On the starvation rate he offers us?
CHIEF: Who else will buy our only asset?
GOVERNOR: Why not find other mining companies who will refine zeiton ore on better terms? Who will pay the seven credits per unit I ask? Why not Amorb?
SIL: Never!
CHIEF: The people of Varos have voted to accept Sil's final terms. You as Governor must impose their will or suffer death by7 default.
GOVERNOR: After I extract the truth about this girl and her companion, the Doctor. Come.
DOCTOR: I had the most peculiar dream
DOCTOR: You'll forgive me if I don't join you.
GOVERNOR: What's the matter? Oh, you grieve for his death. I forget that people do.
PERI: You don't?
GOVERNOR: I did once, but now death is my only friend, my constant and loving companion. Can you feel his, his cold presence?
PERI: I don't want to, thanks.
GOVERNOR: You should. Your life is even more at risk than mine.
CHIEF: The Doctor, he's escaped.
GOVERNOR: How? He's dead.
CHIEF: Not dead. He was just pretending to be.
PERI: He's alive?
CHIEF: And running.
GOVERNOR: Good.
CHIEF: Good?
GOVERNOR: Recapture him, and we bargain this girl's life for information from our Doctor friend.
PERI: And I thought you were a bit better than these other brutes.
GOVERNOR: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: I thought you were my mirror image until I realised that I wasn't holding a gun.
QUILLAM: Who are you?
DOCTOR: A student of science, much interested in primitive nuclear technology.
QUILLAM: The mask. Remove it.
QUILLAM: I've seen you on the screens. You've returned from the dead.
DOCTOR: A waste of effort. I assume there will be something novel by way of spectacle to mark my return to that state?
QUILLAM: I should think something might be arranged. Let's have a little word with the executioners. They're always on the lookout for fresh material.
DOCTOR: After you.
QUILLAM: I don't think so.
SIL: Why is she on Varos?
GOVERNOR: She won't say.
SIL: Are you employed agent of other mining companies, you and that man who was dead?
PERI: No.
SIL: Liar! You belong to Amorb, you lying liar.
GOVERNOR: Why should she belong to Amorb? Well?
PERI: I'm from another time, another century. Nearly three centuries before you were born, I lived in another world. I had an idea you wouldn't believe me.
GOVERNOR: You were right.
CHIEF: Give her to the rehabilitators. A disturbance of her molecular structure will bring out the truth.
SIL: Put her into the reshapement chamber. Watch her change into beast or bird.
PERI: No.
GOVERNOR: Why are you here, Peri? Tell me, please.
PERI: All right. Our Tardis, that box thing outside, is, if you like, a ship of time, a sort of spacecraft. Well, I don't understand the technical stuff, but the Doctor said we must have this special metal to fix the bearings or something, so we had to come here. That's just what we did.
SIL: She's laughing at us, all over the face.
PERI: It's the truth!
GOVERNOR: No matter. Once again, we've captured the mysterious Doctor. Quillam came across him at Prison Control.
CHIEF: He'd have liked that, sir.
GOVERNOR: Yes. How long is it since we rigged a primitive execution, Chief?
CHIEF: Not since after the Outer Dome sabotage trial.
GOVERNOR: Hmm. I think it's time we staged another.
CHIEF: They're always most enjoyable, aren't they, sir.
PERI: What kind of people are you?
ARAK: What're you doing?
ETTA: My viewers report.
ARAK: I'm not on it, am I? I was tired. Reports. Spying. Working men should be
ETTA: Yes? Yes? Go on.
ARAK: Er, not taken seriously for the rubbish they may have spoken earlier on.
DOCTOR: All very traditional. The whole ghastly ritual to be played out.
JONDAR: Four nooses.
DOCTOR: No need to ask for whom.
JONDAR: But there's only three of us.
ARETA: A spare. They're very thorough.
DOCTOR: A fourth noose for Peri is a more likely explanation. But why isn't she in here with us?
JONDAR: Plenty of other prisoners the authorities would be happy to rid themselves of.
DOCTOR: Why are they so anxious to eliminate you?
JONDAR: Because I was curious. I used to maintain the surface shuttle cars. One day I was required to deliver the cars to the dome where the Chief Officer lives. I was never allowed in. Security was excessive, even for Varos. That day my curiosity became too much. I hid inside a car, went inside to where the elite live. Luxury, richness, wealth. I didn't see much, but enough to know that a giant deception had been played against all of our people except for the favoured, the very favoured, few. I pretended I'd seen nothing.
ARETA: The suspicion that perhaps he had was enough to bring him to the Dome of Punishment as fodder for their displays of cruelty and violence.
JONDAR: Areta is my wife. They condemned her, too.
DOCTOR: Without trial.
JONDAR: Secret trial.
ARETA: It's the same thing.
DOCTOR: Hello.
JAILER: Your appeal has been turned down. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: So would I have been, if I'd asked for one.
DOCTOR: Do you always get the priest parts?
PRIEST: We are gathered here today in the sight of the great Video to ask forgiveness and make atonement for three amongst us who have transgressed the laws of Varos.
PERI: Doctor, I'm sorry. I've tried everything. They just won't believe the truth.
DOCTOR: Truth is a very flexible commodity here on Varos, Peri. As long as things appear truthful, that's all that matters.
GOVERNOR: Enlighten us as to the truth about your visit, please, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Why, to help Varos realise the wealth of its potential, what else?
SIL: How, by eating rocks? Kill him! Execute them!
CHIEF: He must have listened to the rebel Jondar and believed his lies.
GOVERNOR: Yes, yes. What is the staging plan, Chief?
CHIEF: The men to hang. The women, I would suggest, be given to reshapement and cell mutation experiment, the results to be exhibited as a warning to women who support their men in acts of violation against the regulations of Varos. I'm sorry you'll be denied the sight of the ladies turning into, well, who knows what. A serpent? A griffin? A new admixture of fish and fowl?
GOVERNOR: Anything to add, Doctor? Anything which might persuade me to halt the sequence of events?
DOCTOR: One request.
CHIEF: One last request? Yes?
GOVERNOR: Well?
DOCTOR: Who is he? Why is he here?
SIL: What interest can my presence matter?
GOVERNOR: The delegate from the Galatron Mining Corporation is here to negotiate our yearly review of market price for the ore of Varos.
DOCTOR: Zeiton ore? Zeiton-7?
GOVERNOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you.
GOVERNOR: Is that all you wish to know?
DOCTOR: For the moment.
SIL: That's all you have, Doctor.
CHIEF: Take the women away.
PERI: Doctor, do something!
ARETA: Jondar! Jondar!
PRIEST: In the name of the great Video and of Varos, who gave his name to our planet, accept the lives of these humble deviants in recompense for their sins. We pray that you will continue to look benignly down upon your devoted servants.
DOCTOR: Wait!
GOVERNOR: I knew it. Hold on broadcast. No sound or vision.
DOCTOR: My death will prevent Varos from ever progressing out of the reach of extortion of such as the Galatron Mining Company. Our deaths will send any hope for this planet back into the pit of fear and misery, which has for so long been the lot of its people.
SIL: Pull the lever! Stretch them out of this life!
DOCTOR: Wait! I came to this planet because I needed a new source of energy supply. My Tardis depends for its function upon a rare and precious mineral of Varos. Zeiton-7. I can show you new prosperity.
SIL: Destroy them now!
GOVERNOR: I will give the order for execution.
SIL: Kill! Kill! Kill!
GOVERNOR: I trust you are unharmed, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Do you often employ the noose trick?
GOVERNOR: As a means of eliciting true information, it has often been successful. You suspected our bluff?
DOCTOR: I noticed your cameras weren't broadcasting. A real execution would have been broadcast.
GOVERNOR: Ah, yes. What I have to discover now is the truth of your statements made from the scaffold.
DOCTOR: I will discuss nothing, reveal nothing, until I have proof that Peri and Areta have been released unharmed from the cell mutation experiment.
SIL: He has nothing to reveal. He is lying. An Amorb agent who wishes only to usurp our worthy Galatron contracts by rashful promises.
GOVERNOR: Until I can hear what each of you has to say or offer, the matter rests without decision. Should the Doctor be lying, he will find the next noose about his neck will sever his head from his spinal column. But should he be accurate in his appraisal of the potential worth of our zeiton ore, I shall want to know, Sil, why you and your company have been duping Varos these many generations.
SIL: How dare I be spoken to like this! I will reject all offers!
GOVERNOR: That releases me from my people's decision to accept them. Thank you.
SIL: Pargh!
QUILLAM: Preparation complete. To your posts.
PERI: How long will the process last?
ARETA: I heard them say it was a matter for initial experiment.
PERI: Anything could happen to us just for their amusement.
ARETA: Oh, something's happening to my arms.
PERI: Mine feel strange too. My skin. Oh no!
SIL: Intolerable all of this Doctor being allowed to live!
CHIEF: The Governor likes and may believe him. Zeiton-7 has brought your company great wealth. You have miscalculated events. For the sake of a few miserable extra credits you may have lost the source of all our wealth and power!
SIL: Listen to me. I have plans to take charge of this planet of Varos. I have put in a request to have a Galatron occupation force to speed to this sector. A little time is all we need, Chief.
CHIEF: The Doctor will tell him the true value of zeiton!
SIL: Only if his women are released unharmed. Have you done that?
CHIEF: Not yet.
SIL: Then let us observe the experiment of the tissue transmogrifier. I am interested in science. I do not wish to impede its progress.
SIL: Doctor's friend is feathered. The other one, she's almost attractive now. How long before permanent result ensues?
CHIEF: I'm not exactly certain. It's not too long, I would think.
SIL: Perhaps I'll keep them in my dome as pretty-pretty pets.
QUILLAM: It is too advanced.
DOCTOR: Well, where are they?
GOVERNOR: There's a problem.
DOCTOR: What?
GOVERNOR: Something they call a transmogrifier was at too advanced a stage.
CHIEF: We were unable to reverse the transmutation of your lovely ladies.
DOCTOR: There was plenty of time to halt the experiment.
GOVERNOR: I gave explicit orders that the process be halted.
CHIEF: Too late. Sorry.
JONDAR: I'll kill him.
DOCTOR: Who controls the transmutation experiment?
GOVERNOR: Mister Quillam, our technical director and principal devisor of programmes.
QUILLAM: And controller of all that happens in the People's Dome of Punishment and Correction.
JONDAR: Areta! Do something!
GOVERNOR: It's probably too late.
DOCTOR: Only probably.
QUILLAM: It is an unstable process. Even I am not quite certain as to how it works exactly.
DOCTOR: That beam that radiates, what source of energy is it derived from?
QUILLAM: The nuclear bombardment beams release all the power latent in the recipient's mind. If the changelings see themselves as unworthy, they can become serpentine or reptilian. She, for instance, must wish to fly away from trouble as would a bird.
GOVERNOR: It's an offshoot of our mining research technology. We found our miners growing fur and claws, the better, they thought, to dig with.
DOCTOR: How can the process be reversed?
QUILLAM: Who knows? We don't require such findings here.
DOCTOR: And you call yourself a research scientist?
QUILLAM: Certainly. Which is why this trial must continue. An experiment like this has never been so advanced or so successful before.
DOCTOR: Turn off the machine. They might still be restored to normality.
GOVERNOR: Mister Quillam, I make formal request.
QUILLAM: I am Section Controller, a permanent position. No one orders me. Certainly not a transient Governor in the twilight of his reign.
DOCTOR: Who decides the authority of command?
GOVERNOR: The regulations hand it to the Officer Guard by long tradition.
DOCTOR: But it can be changed?
QUILLAM: Not by him.
GOVERNOR: You have held your position for too long, Mister Quillam. That becomes ever more obvious.
QUILLAM: No one has the nerve or the will to wrest it from me, Mister Governor, sir.
DOCTOR: Do you still experiment on your own person?
QUILLAM: Not any more. Why?
DOCTOR: But in the past you exposed yourself to much danger, I think.
QUILLAM: Yes. Why do you ask? How do you know?
DOCTOR: Your mask.
JONDAR: Hold it!
DOCTOR: Gun. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Turn off the transmutation process.
QUILLAM: Take your choice. There must be a hundred switches to choose from, if it's a switch that controls the bombardment beams.
JONDAR: Doctor, can you decide which?
DOCTOR: No time.
DOCTOR: You, out.
DOCTOR: That won't be necessary. Keys. Thank you. Out.
DOCTOR: We must have stopped the process before the final transformation was complete. Without final phase bombardment, their bodily metabolism is reasserting itself. The guards must return soon. You said there's supposed to be an escape exit?
JONDAR: On the other side of the dome, but to reach it from here is impossible.
DOCTOR: Not now. The odds are unpredictable. With the Control centre damaged we may yet have an outside chance. We must move on.
JONDAR: What, leave them here?
DOCTOR: No, take them with us.
DOCTOR: Peri! Peri, can you hear me?
JONDAR: Areta! Areta!
DOCTOR: Can you move, Peri? Try! You are Peri. Peri.
PERI: Peri?
DOCTOR: I am the Doctor and you are Peri. Perpugilliam Brown.
PERI: Peri.
DOCTOR: It's a question of re-imprinting their identities, of establishing again who they are.
JONDAR: Wake up, Areta. Come on!
DOCTOR: Can you walk, Peri? Come on, try.
PERI: I thought I could fly.
DOCTOR: Yes, but walking is all that's required for now. Come on, Peri. Walk.
ARAK: What is going on? Boring scenes for hours, now this. Somebody wants shooting.
ETTA: They know what they're doing.
ARAK: They don't know what's what any more than you or that Governor do. It's rubbish. Gibberish. You'd watch anything, you would.
ETTA: I wouldn't watch you.
QUILLAM: There's no control. All maintenance reports confirm the attack damaged a large number of operating circuits. The effects are impossible to control.
CHIEF: Why not shut off all the power?
QUILLAM: And allow every prisoner in the dome to escape, including this Doctor? Oh no, I want them delivered to me.
CHIEF: The screens are still showing scenes from the Punishment Dome.
QUILLAM: And they'll continue to do so. It's the only way we have of assessing the effects of the damage done.
CHIEF: But all of Varos can witness the confusion.
QUILLAM: All they'll see is spectacle. Bizarre happenings, strange sights, and think we've organised them. They'll see rebels surprised and overcome, and they'll be entertained long enough to allow us to repair the damage here and regain control.
CHIEF: This Doctor must be eliminated. He smells the truth of things.
QUILLAM: The dome will take care of him.
PERI: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Cover me. I'll get the girls.
DOCTOR: Areta! Where's Peri? Where's Peri gone, Areta?
DOCTOR: Quick, Jondar!
ARAK: That's more like it.
ETTA: I thought he was dead.
ARAK: No. Pay attention.
SIL: My insulted person can stand no more! Either you sign the newly agreed price for the zeiton ore, or I will leave you and the Varosian to starve on this miserablest of planets, with nothing to eat except unsold zeitony.
GOVERNOR: You are in no position to threaten me now.
CHIEF: Found wandering near Prison Control. I brought her here to display as evidence before the people.
GOVERNOR: I will decide when and if I broadcast.
CHIEF: Not any more.
CHIEF: The regulations have a clause for just the situation that we are in now. At the end of every Governor's term there comes a time of disapproval, where the people tire of his incompetence. The wish to vote him down.
GOVERNOR: The wish to see all the cells of his body destroyed.
CHIEF: When the final vote is avoided, the Chief Officer is empowered to insist on a final vote. You must accept full responsibility for failing to quell the prison rebellion led by this woman and her companion, the Doctor. Prepare for your final broadcast, Governor.
DOCTOR: We must find Peri.
JONDAR: She could be anywhere.
GOVERNOR: Here we will die, as have so many Governors. The Chief will broadcast first. Anything I say after that will seem like bluster and lies.
PERI: Can I speak? Can I say what I know?
GOVERNOR: The ramblings of someone deranged by the transmogrification process.
PERI: But I'm fine now.
GOVERNOR: We have no hope.
PERI: How long?
GOVERNOR: As soon as the Chief assembles the Officer Guard. The regulations insist that the twelve most senior officers place their names in hazard. The Chief draws a name and the unlucky winner is brought in here and forced to govern.
PERI: In fear of suffering the same death
GOVERNOR: Yes. The theory being that a man scared for his life will find solutions to this planet's problems, except the poor unfortunate will discover there are no popular solutions to the difficulties he will find waiting for him here.
PERI: It's crazy. Cruel.
GOVERNOR: It's Varos. Maldak, isn't it?
MALDAK: Yes, sir.
GOVERNOR: Put your gun down. I have no intention of trying to escape.
MALDAK: Can't do that, sir.
GOVERNOR: Weren't you elected to the Officer Guard when my name was drawn as Governor?
MALDAK: Correct, sir.
GOVERNOR: Might I ask one favour? Let the girl go free.
MALDAK: I can't do that, sir.
GOVERNOR: You know that soon I will be destroyed. Soon a new Governor will be elected.
MALDAK: That is the custom, sir.
GOVERNOR: What if the name they draw is yours? You've witnessed how impossible the system is. You're an intelligent man. The regulations are archaic, distorted, unworkable. Even if you're not chosen, an enquiry will be called. New Governors always have enquiries. It was you, wasn't it, who showed the Doctor and the rebel Jondar where the women were held captive.
MALDAK: I couldn't help that, sir.
GOVERNOR: They'll say you should have resisted.
MALDAK: Just what is it that you want?
GOVERNOR: For you to turn your back, let us go, find the Doctor who has words and perhaps knowledge which might bring salvation to everyone, except the Chief and his cronies.
MALDAK: No, sir, I can't do that.
GOVERNOR: And Peri.
MALDAK: No, sir. I'm sorry.
GOVERNOR: At least, when the vote goes against me, and the human cell disintegrator beams pour down, kill Peri, please, to spare her from the rehabilitators.
GOVERNOR: I tried. We will die together.
JONDAR: It's no good.
DOCTOR: Where are we?
JONDAR: I don't know.
DOCTOR: I wonder why we've been allowed to progress so far into the dome without being apprehended?
ARETA: This whole place is cracking up. The guards must be as confused as we are.
JONDAR: I think we're into what they call the endgame. Not many trialists reach this stage.
DOCTOR: Could that be where the escape exit would be?
JONDAR: Presumably.
DOCTOR: What are we waiting for? I must be cautious. From now on, I believe the mind games and jolly tricks are over. What we're entering now could be the area of most dangerous ordeal.
CHIEF : This is a forced vote. I have explained my actions. The Governor must now explain his, and then you, my fellow Varosians, must use your vote and decide.
GOVERNOR : I have addressed you many times, and you have seen other Governors approach the ultimate crisis point of their regime. The time of forced vote now is upon me. I am not afraid to die.
ARAK: Good.
ETTA: Hey!
GOVERNOR: Your system is wrong. We sell ourselves cheaply for nothing to such as Sil and his like. I see my words mean nothing, that you all wish the harsh system of Varos to continue. So be it.
PERI: Isn't there anything I can do?
GOVERNOR: No.
ETTA: No! You've messed up the whole system. They'll be coming round for you. Voting twice, and using someone else's voting box? Both criminal offences.
PERI: We must find the Doctor.
MALDAK: He's in the End Zone.
GOVERNOR: He must be seeking the safe exit.
PERI: Well, let's go there, then.
GOVERNOR: Not that way. There has to be another route.
MALDAK: There is. The ventilation ducting.
GOVERNOR: There's an outlet here.
MALDAK: I once spent eight days down there searching for escaped prisoners. I know it only too well.
PERI: Come on, then.
DOCTOR: No! Be gone. You are shadows, insubstantial ghosts. We are real, you are not.
DOCTOR: I think perhaps we should try another route.
SIL: Where is Governor? Why is he still at life and liberty? Why is everything no longer as it was?
CHIEF: We are still the power.
SIL: Why not you both prove it?
ARETA: What did he die from?
DOCTOR: I don't know. His neck's swollen as if to burst. Poison, perhaps?
JONDAR: Did he take it, or been given it?
ARETA: Doctor!
JONDAR: Fellow prisoners.
DOCTOR: This is no time for speeches, Jondar.
ARETA: What shall we do?
DOCTOR: Run.
DOCTOR: Stop, Areta!
DOCTOR: If you value your lives, don't touch those tendrils. In, but don't allow one touch.
JONDAR: What do they want? Why do they want us?
DOCTOR: I noticed a pile of bones back there. I think we were on their dinner menu.
JONDAR: Shush. Patrol car.
ARETA: We're trapped.
JONDAR: What do we do?
DOCTOR: The best we can. Do you think you could attach this string to that clump of vines without killing yourself?
QUILLAM: I see you have a keen interest in the flora of Varos, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Just a passing fancy.
CHIEF: It'll pass faster than you think. Kill them!
QUILLAM: Wait. This man has insulted me. He must suffer for my humiliation.
CHIEF: This is no time for revenge. Kill them quickly!
QUILLAM: And deprive Varos of an example of how traitors are dealt with? The cameras are still functioning. Let the show begin. I want to hear them scream till I am deaf with pleasure. To see their limbs twist in excruciating agony. Ultimately their blood must gush and flow along the gutters of Varos. The whole planet must delight in their torture and death.
DOCTOR: An excellent scenario. Not mad about the part.
QUILLAM: Proceed!
DOCTOR: Now!
DOCTOR: Let's get away from here.
DOCTOR: Stay where you are! Don't move!
PERI: What is it?
DOCTOR: Poison. One touch and 
PERI: Poison ivy?
DOCTOR: Something like that.
DOCTOR: It'd give you a very nasty rash.
PERI: Oh, Doctor.
SIL: Plenipotentiary Sil to Galatron Occupation Force Commander. Urgent need for instant invasion of planet Varos to consolidate our interest. React immediately!
SIL: Water me. I must look my best to assume the emperorship of this primitive planet.
SIL: Gently, gently. Take extreme care with my person if you wish to retain your skins. Ah, that's better. Mirror, mirror, mirror. Come on, mirror! Mirror! Oh yes, I will wear the mantle of power so, so handsomely.
SIL: Ah, there you are. I called you here to inform you that a force of invasion is about to land.
DOCTOR: Really? From where?
SIL: My home planet. From Thoros Beta. You had innumerable chances to settle with me, Governor. Now your people will work for me. I will be Governor of Governors. I will be Viceroy of Varos. The confirmation of my colonisation force.
GOVERNOR: Report of zeiton-7 traces found on asteroid Biosculptor. Invasion of Varos cancelled.
SIL: Argh!
DOCTOR: The ways of the ruler are fraught with uncertainty, are they not, Sil?
SIL: Certainly. Certainly.
GOVERNOR: There's more. New supplies of zeiton-7 required urgently. Start shipments immediately. Pay any price asked by Varosians. Well, shall we commence negotiations from a reasonable base?
SIL: Of what? Of what?
GOVERNOR: Twenty credits per unit.
SIL: Twenty? Twenty? Argh!
DOCTOR: I think he needs more than water, Peri, eh?
PERI: Like cyanide.
DOCTOR: Oh come, Peri, where's your sense of justice?
PERI: What about that transmogrifier thing he put me in?
DOCTOR: I think we'll leave the Varosians to work out their own idea of justice, Peri.
GOVERNOR: I'm very grateful, Doctor. Varos is grateful. Is there nothing we can offer you in return?
DOCTOR: Well, er, a little zeiton-7 would be quite useful, not to say essential.
GOVERNOR: You shall have as much as you need. Maldak will arrange it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Goodbye.
GOVERNOR: Ah, goodbye. Goodbye.
PERI: Goodbye.
SIL: You can't leave me here!
DOCTOR: Now you see me.
SIL: Argh!
GOVERNOR : And that, fellow citizens of Varos, is my vowed intention. For without justice and peace and tolerance, we have no future. I know you will all work as hard as I shall for a glorious tomorrow. Thank you for allowing me into your homes. Thank you.
ARAK: No more executions, torture, nothing.
ETTA: It's all changed. We're free.
ARAK: Are we?
ETTA: Yes.
ARAK: What shall we do?
ETTA: Dunno.
DOCTOR: The orthoganal readings haven't altered. Good. Splendid new elements on linings on the orbital transmission, thanks to the Governor's generous supply of zeiton-7. Still, now the whole of Varos knows it's more precious than gold, you can understand their generosity, I suppose.
PERI: Doctor, you're sure the Tardis will function properly?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, absolutely. Disappointed?
PERI: You think I'm crazy?
DOCTOR: You all right?
PERI: Apart from the residual side effects of fowl pest, I feel fine.
DOCTOR: As long as you stay away from millet and cuttlefish.
