Time and the Rani
Part One
RANI: Leave the girl. It's the man I want. Take him to my laboratory.
RANI: Sarn, stop dithering. Collecting this one has already put me behind schedule.
SARN: I don't want to harm him.
RANI: Seal it and label it.
RANI: Well, what are you waiting for?
BEYUS: You haven't given the name for the label.
RANI: Einstein.
RANI: Insolence could cost your people dearly, Beyus.
SARN: I'm sure Beyus did not mean to appear insolent. He would never do that.
RANI: I find your incompetence more than enough without listening to your puerile opinions.
BEYUS: Then why not let Sarn go. You have me as a hostage, you don't need her.
RANI: I shall decide my needs. They unfortunately require the use of Lakertyans.
BEYUS: You leave me with no illusions about the hatred that you hold for us.
RANI: Hatred? Another fantasy. I have no feelings one way or the other. Outside of these experiments you have absolutely no significance.
BEYUS: I find your detachment difficult to understand.
RANI: All you need understand is that these specimens are geniuses, every one of them. And unless they're kept in prime condition, you'll have more than the miserable skin of this creature to worry about.
BEYUS: Have you managed to procure the means to repair your laboratory equipment?
RANI: Oh yes, indeed I have.
DOCTOR: No, no, Mel.
DOCTOR: That was a nice nap. Now, down to business.
DOCTOR: I'm a bit worried about the temporal flicker in sector thirteen. There's a bicentennial refit of the Tardis to book in. I must just pop over to Centauri Seven and then perhaps a quick holiday. Right, that all seems quite clear. Just three small points. Where am I? Who am I? And who are you? The Rani! Stay back!
RANI: This is idiotic. You'll injure yourself.
DOCTOR: Why should you care? Since you were exiled from Gallifrey, you've had nothing but contempt for all other Time Lords.
RANI: My contempt started long before my exile.
DOCTOR: And what do you want with me? And where's Mel?
RANI: She's perfectly safe, but how long she remains so depends on you.
DOCTOR: You're up to something. Perhaps I'll find the answer on this.
RANI: You won't recognise the planet. It's Lakertya, and there's no evidence that it's ever been graced by your meddling presence.
DOCTOR: You're trying to deflect me, so the answer is on here. Quarks. One up, one down. One strange matter? That asteroid is composed of strange matter. What monstrous experiment are you dabbling in now?
RANI: I didn't go to the trouble of bringing you here just to discuss the ethics of my work.
DOCTOR: Ethics? Don't be such a hypocrite. Your past is littered with the mutilated results of your unethical experiments.
RANI: I had all I can take of that cant in our university days. Am I expected to abandon my research because of the side effects on inferior species. Are you prepared to abandon walking in case you squash an insect underfoot?
DOCTOR: Stay away. Whatever you've brought me here for, I'm having no part of it.
RANI: Leave him there.
SARN: He may be hurt.
BEYUS: Sarn, don't interfere.
RANI: I'll deal with you latter.
RANI: And that's the last time she will interfere.
DOCTOR: Stay away or I'll smash this!
RANI: Urak!
DOCTOR: I'll smash it to pieces!
RANI: Urak, get in here!
RANI: Urak, what's happening?
URAK : The female Sarn has escaped, Mistress Rani.
RANI: She won't get far.
RANI: See that the trap is reset.
URAK : Certainly. Your powers are truly wondrous, Mistress Rani.
BEYUS: What's happened?
RANI: It need not concern you. Roll up his sleeve.
BEYUS: Why are you doing this?
RANI: To make sure he suffers a healthy dose of amnesia when he wakes.
BEYUS: Amnesia?
RANI: That's what I said.
IKONA: Go on, run. Run! The area's full of traps, as well you know.
MEL: Me? Why should I? This is insane.
IKONA: Don't play the innocent. Your friends set this trap.
MEL: Look, it's all very well being upset
IKONA: Upset? Another of your obscene murders takes place
MEL: Stop accusing me. This had nothing to do with me.
IKONA: Lies! If I didn't need you as a hostage, you'd be dead.
MEL: A hostage? For what?
IKONA: To exchange for our leader. Your friends took him prisoner.
MEL: Why do you keep calling them friends of mine?
IKONA: You arrived from outer space, as they did. Now they can have you back. On my terms.
DOCTOR: Where am I? Who are you?
RANI: Mel. Melanie. Are you all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: All right? Am I? Of course. And you?
RANI: Me? Yes, of course. Why not?
DOCTOR: Why not indeed. We both are.
DOCTOR: A bull in a barber shop. A navigational guidance system distorter. This would force any passing spaceship into landing here. Where are we, by the way?
RANI: In your laboratory. On Lakertya. Doctor, are you sure you're well?
DOCTOR: Of course. Fit as a trombone.
RANI: Fiddle.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
RANI: Fit as a fiddle.
DOCTOR: Are you? Nerves, I expect. Now, let's see. What were we up to, er, Mel, did you say your name was?
RANI: You don't remember me, do you? Do you?
DOCTOR: Red hair. I recall red hair.
DOCTOR: Argh! Who's that?
RANI: Me.
DOCTOR: No, standing next to you.
RANI: That's you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Me? No wonder I've lost my memory.
RANI: Look, you're supposed to be conducting an experiment, not frightening yourself to death.
DOCTOR: Experiment?
RANI: Yes, it exploded and threw you to the floor. Me, too. Knocked us both cold. When I came round you looked like this.
DOCTOR: The explosion must have caused me to regenerate.
RANI: You mean, this is what you're going to be like permanently.
DOCTOR: I want all mirrors removed from the Tardis henceforth.
RANI: So you remember the Tardis, then?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, the Tardis. And you. Mel. There's something not quite in sync. I must be suffering from post-regeneration amnesia.
RANI: Oh, don't worry. It'll soon wear off. Meanwhile, why not repair the machine? You said it was important.
DOCTOR: Important? Did I? I wonder what I was up to.
DOCTOR: No, seems pretty far gone. Need a genius to unravel it.
RANI: But you're a genius.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I definitely remember that.
RANI: Especially in thermodynamics.
DOCTOR: How did you know that, Mel?
RANI: You told me. You said it was your special subject when you were at university.
DOCTOR: University? You remind me of someone I used to know when I was there.
RANI: Doctor, this machine has to be repaired and you're the only person with the knowledge to do it.
DOCTOR: Your confidence in me is very flattering, Mel.
MEL: Will you listen? How many more times do I have to tell you I'm not your enemy. Look, can we start from scratch? My name's Mel and I come from Earth. Your turn.
IKONA: This is no game.
MEL: All right, let's try another tack. You claim I was alone when you found me.
IKONA: Oh, don't go on about this Doctor again.
MEL: I have to.
IKONA: There was no one else in the strange box. If he exists, he must have left you.
MEL: No way. The Doctor wouldn't do that.
IKONA: If he has any sense he would.
MEL: It's not even up for discussion.
IKONA: Good, I shall enjoy the silence.
MEL: Watch out!
MEL: Now will you accept that I'm not your enemy?
IKONA: We must hurry. The Tetraps will come to investigate.
MEL: What made you think I was in league with them?
IKONA: You're not Lakertyan. You don't belong on this planet.
MEL: Then they're human, like me?
IKONA: No, not like you, although almost as hideous.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on.
RANI: Come on where?
DOCTOR: Why I chose you as an assistant, I'll never know. Perhaps I will when I've regained my memory.
RANI: Well, what is it you want?
DOCTOR: Well, look at me. Can't you see? Mop my brow!
DOCTOR: What'd you do that for?
RANI: It was your fault.
DOCTOR: A bad workman always blames his fools.
RANI: Tools! Blames his tools!
DOCTOR: Do I detect a hint of bad temper, Mel? Why are you behaving so uppity? Could it be that you think yourself superior to me?
RANI: Now how could I possibly think that, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Quite. Though at the moment I feel far from superior. This is all a mystery to me.
RANI: But surely there's a catalyst?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes. Must you state the obvious? I know that its functions diffuse the impulses from there with this goo. But what's it for? I'm beginning to think this set-up's got nothing to do with me.
RANI: Why do you think that?
DOCTOR: Omnipotence. The mind behind this bag of tricks operates on a grand scale.
RANI: Well, all the more reason to suppose that it's you, Doctor.
MEL: Hold on. I need a breather.
IKONA: We must keep moving.
MEL: What happened to the rest of your people? Won't they help?
IKONA: No, they've been completely subdued.
MEL: We could at least try.
IKONA: The only one they listen to is Beyus, our leader.
MEL: All right, let's go to him.
IKONA: He's the hostage I wanted to exchange you for. Shush. Listen.
IKONA: Quickly!
MEL: We can't go that way, it's completely exposed.
IKONA: For once, don't argue.
IKONA: Hopefully they'll think we doubled back to stay undercover.
MEL: Always providing they don't flush us out first.
DOCTOR: What's in there?
RANI: I have no idea.
DOCTOR: Are you as clueless as you appear, Mel?
RANI: Don't blame me, Doctor. I've never been inside. You wouldn't let me.
DOCTOR: Wouldn't I?
RANI: No. You said the air wasn't sterile enough for humans.
DOCTOR: That's it, then. I'm doing nothing until my memory returns. Nothing until I know what I'm about.
RANI: Oh, come on, now.
DOCTOR: No, I will not work in the dark like this.
RANI: But you thrive on challenge.
DOCTOR: I'm adamant. This could be some diabolical scheme.
RANI: To do what?
DOCTOR: That's the question.
RANI: Oh, Doctor, really.
 RANI: You're just over-excited. Here, drink this.
DOCTOR: Hmm? What is it?
RANI: Just water.
DOCTOR: Oh, you drink it. I don't want it. Don't try to humour me. Leave me alone.
RANI: You can't loll around. It's simply not like you.
DOCTOR: How do you know what I'm like? I've regenerated. I mean, look at me. Look at me.
RANI: Yes, you've changed outwardly. But I'm sure you must still have the same sweet nature.
DOCTOR: Perhaps this is my new persona. Sulky, bad-tempered. I mean, think how I spoke to you earlier.
RANI: But you didn't mean it. I was at fault.
DOCTOR: Even so, that's probably how I am now. You don't understand regeneration, Mel. It's a lottery, and I've drawn the short plank. Anyway, I need a radiation wave meter and, brilliant as I am, even I can't improvise that.
RANI: What about the Tardis? Won't there be a radiation wave meter there?
DOCTOR: The Tardis? Do you know where it is?
RANI: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I fancy a breath of fresh air. We'll both go.
RANI: No, wait.
RANI: Urak?
URAK : Yes, mistress?
RANI: Remove the girl from the Tardis immediately.
URAK : She is not there, mistress.
RANI: Well then, find her, you incompetent fool!
DOCTOR: Are you coming, Mel?
RANI: Yes, Doctor, coming.
MEL: No one about. Come on.
IKONA: No! It's too soon.
MEL: Not for me. I'm going to find the Doctor.
IKONA: If he's been captured, he's as good as dead.
DOCTOR: Rather unusual species. Can't say I recognise it. Humanoid with reptilian influences, wouldn't you say, Mel?
RANI: Lakertyan. A race so indolent they can't be bothered to bury their dead.
DOCTOR: Really? I suppose we've explored this planet. I wish I could remember.
RANI: There's not a lot to remember. The benevolent climate has induced lethargy. They've failed to realise their full potential.
DOCTOR: Rather a harsh judgment, Mel.
RANI: Not mine. Yours.
DOCTOR: The more I know me, the less I like me.
MEL: All right, I'll find him without you. One thing about the Doctor, you can't miss him in that outfit.
DOCTOR: No, I think not. Lacks my natural humility.
DOCTOR: Doesn't look right without a horse. I need something more dignified, Timelord-ish.
DOCTOR: A little portentous, perhaps, Mel?
RANI: Pretentious is the word.
DOCTOR: Old hat?
DOCTOR: Not frilled. 
DOCTOR: How's that? Would that bowl a maiden over?
RANI: Yes, yes, yes. Very elegant.
DOCTOR: Ah, thank goodness in this regeneration I've regained my impeccable sense of haute couture.
RANI: If you've finished preening, could we please get what we came for?
 RANI: I'm sorry, but you seemed to be losing control.
DOCTOR: I was hallucinating. I had an overwhelming sense of evil. And there was a word. Ra, Ra, Ran, Rad
RANI: Radiation wave meter. That's what we came here for.
DOCTOR: Oh yes. Where do you reckon I'd keep it?
RANI: Tool room.
DOCTOR: Won't be a jiffy. Absence makes the nose grow longer. 
RANI: Cretin.
RANI: Yes, Urak. What is it?
URAK : We have found the lost girl, mistress.
RANI: Focus in on her.
URAK : Certainly, Mistress Rani.
DOCTOR: Rani, that's the name, the evil name.
RANI: Is that her, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Er, well, yes, it must be. Yes.
RANI: And she's evil?
DOCTOR: Completely.
RANI: Then she must be destroyed.
DOCTOR: Destroyed? Let's not be hasty.
MEL: Doctor! Help!
MEL: Help!
Part Two
MEL: Help!
MEL: Help! Help me!
IKONA: Be quiet and don't move.
MEL: Have you, have you done this before?
IKONA: No, this is the first time, but Mel, if you don't stop squawking, it'll be the last.
DOCTOR: You know, I can't help feeling sorry for the Rani, Mel, getting caught in her own devious trap.
RANI: She's got nobody to blame but herself.
DOCTOR: I suppose so, but what was she doing prowling around on Lakertya?
RANI: Well, I'd have thought the reason was obvious.
DOCTOR: Is it?
RANI: She must be on the brink of a major discovery.
DOCTOR: Have to be a cosmic breakthrough for a neurochemist of her stature to come storming the barricades.
RANI: All the more reason to press on, get there first. You've repeatedly said that in the wrong hands, scientific knowledge can be dangerous.
DOCTOR: What scientific knowledge? What am I doing? If only I could remember.
RANI/RANI: Oh, don't start all that again. Look, repair the machine and maybe we'll find the solution.
DOCTOR: The machine won't tell me what's behind that locked door, will it? The machine won't restore my memory, will it? If the Rani was after our experiment, we must be playing with fire.
RANI: Oh, forget the Rani. She's finished, destroyed.
DOCTOR: Is she? Oh, don't underestimate her. She's a brilliant but sterile mind. There's not one spark of decency in her.
RANI: I'm overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You are?
RANI: Such superior diagnostic talents.
DOCTOR: It's my forte.
RANI: Well then, it's a pity they can't be concentrated on the machine.
DOCTOR: And another thing. Why was the Rani dressed like you, Mel?
RANI: Perhaps she's fashion conscious.
DOCTOR: No. She was in disguise. Practising another one of her talents.
RANI: Really? Are you going to be much longer in there, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Afraid so. More hasta less vista.
MEL: Any sign of the, what did you call it?
IKONA: Tetraps. No. Come, keep moving.
MEL: Look. Look, look, I'm grateful for your help, of course, but gratitude isn't going to turn me into a puppet.
IKONA: I've already come to that painful conclusion.
MEL: Well then, tell me, are we just running scared or are we heading for somewhere in particular?
IKONA: The answer to both questions is yes. Now can we go?
IKONA: Wait here.
MEL: Hurry, Ikona! Hurry!
[The Rani's laboratory[
DOCTOR: I cannot understand how I could have made such a fundamental mistake.
RANI: Let me.
RANI: What was the mistake?
DOCTOR: The heat radiation from the catalyst was of high frequency.
RANI: You mean I, you used the wrong heat conducting material?
DOCTOR: So elementary. I broke the second law of thermodynamics.
RANI: So, if we substituted a suitable material, would it work?
DOCTOR: You should know the answer to that, Mel. Didn't C P Snow expound on thermodynamics?
RANI: Doctor, is this relevant?
DOCTOR: Well, you said you admired all his writings, read all his books.
RANI: Did I? Oh, I must have forgotten.
DOCTOR: You, Mel, forget? A kangaroo never forgets.
RANI: Elephant.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Memory like an elephant. A running gag applied to you, I feel sure, Mel.
RANI: Oh. Perhaps the machine exploding affected my memory too. Doctor, what were the readings?
DOCTOR: Oh here, see for yourself.
IKONA: That's where they've set up headquarters.
MEL: Well then, that's where the Doctor must be.
IKONA: You can't be sure.
MEL: I can. You don't know the Doctor.
IKONA: If he's in there, I probably never will.
MEL: There's no if about it. He's in there.
MEL: Any idea what the central ramp's for?
IKONA: No. All I know is that building it cost the lives of many Lakertyans.
MEL: Something must have gone terribly wrong.
IKONA: The logic of that escapes me.
MEL: Well, they kidnapped the Doctor, and no one would do that unless they were desperate for his help. He's not exactly predictable.
IKONA: Come on.
RANI: Would PHB or PES do?
DOCTOR: What?
RANI: I asked you a question!
DOCTOR: Did you? Mel, there's something caged in there.
RANI: Yes, I dare say. Would PHB or PES do?
DOCTOR: Eh?
RANI: As a suitable material for the machine.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. PHB. It's biodegradable. We don't want to litter up Lakertya with non-destructible waste like they're doing on your planet, Mel.
RANI: What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Sugar and starch. We can ferment our own.
RANI: You won't find it there. What about the alternative?
DOCTOR: PES? No, not so good. It's a petroleum based plastic.
RANI: Slightly amber, almost opaque?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
RANI: I know where I can get some.
DOCTOR: Where?
RANI: From the Lakertyans. You repair the machine, I'll go and get it.
DOCTOR: But I thought you said the Lakertyans weren't very advanced.
RANI: Did I?
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: When we discovered that sad skeleton.
IKONA: Wait here.
IKONA: Faroon.
FAROON: I'm glad to see you, Ikona, although I shouldn't be.
IKONA: Does sitting on opposite sides of the fence mean we can't still be friends?
FAROON: I'm afraid it does when you cut yourself off from the rest of us, and deliberately ignore Beyus' instructions.
IKONA: I can't accept he's right to collaborate.
FAROON: He is being held hostage. He has no choice. It's the only way that Beyus can save the rest of us from destruction.
MEL: He didn't save her, did he.
IKONA: It's all right, Faroon. She's not with the Tetraps.
FAROON: You said her?
MEL: Yes. Well, she was running away from something.
FAROON: You saw what happened too, Ikona? You're not usually so reluctant to air your thoughts. From which direction did she come?
MEL: Well, along there. It was as though she was escaping from the Tetrap headquarters.
IKONA: It was Sarn.
MEL: Who was Sarn?
IKONA: The daughter of Faroon and Beyus.
MEL: I'm sorry. I didn't realise.
FAROON: I, I had to be told.
IKONA: There was nothing to be done. She stepped on a trap.
FAROON: Yet another victim. I must go to Beyus.
IKONA: Where are you going?
MEL: If Beyus is collaborating then he must be in the Tetrap headquarters, and that's where the Doctor will be.
IKONA: You're still determined to get in?
MEL: No matter what the risk.
IKONA: Madness.
IKONA: It must be contagious. I'll draw him off.
MEL: Who are you?
DOCTOR: You! Where's Mel?
MEL: Where's the Doctor?
DOCTOR: What have you done with her?
MEL: Stay away from me. What have you done with the Doctor?
MEL: Now we'll get to the truth. What have you done with him, you brute?
DOCTOR: He's here!
MEL: Where? Under the carpet?
DOCTOR: It's me, you washer woman! Me!
MEL: Never! You're nothing like him. If the Doctor's been harmed, I
MEL: Help! Put me down! Oh!
DOCTOR: Drop the melodramatics. Your pathetic impersonation doesn't fool me at all. Incidentally, that wig's not you.
URAK: I am sorry, Mistress. I have not seen you dressed in these clothes before.
RANI: Inquests bore me.
DOCTOR: I knew you weren't finished, Rani. I told Mel as much.
MEL: You told me?
DOCTOR: No, Mel!
MEL: I am Mel. Who's the Rani?
DOCTOR: Try looking in the mirror at the face of evil.
MEL: I've had enough of this drivel.
DOCTOR: All right, compromise. Let me feel your pulse.
MEL: Don't touch me!
DOCTOR: Ah, the proof of the pumpkin's in the squeezing.
MEL: You don't even talk like the Doctor, you miserable fraud.
DOCTOR: Let me feel your pulse. Pulses, I should say. Two of them. One for each heart.
MEL: You're a raving lunatic.
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps I am, because if you're the Rani, I'm dicing with destruction.
MEL: And if I'm Mel?
DOCTOR: Mel? The worst she'll do is give me carrot juice. Carrot juice? What made me think of that?
MEL: Well, perhaps the real Doctor told you. It was his favourite drink.
DOCTOR: Favourite? I hate it.
MEL: Oh.
DOCTOR: Ah, caught you out, haven't I.
MEL: But if you're the real Doctor, then why do you look like that?
DOCTOR: I've regenerated, and I'm suffering from post-regenerative amnesia, as far as I can remember. Fair exchange is no mockery. You feel my pulses, I'll feel yours. I'll lean across here with my arm behind my back, if you want proof I'm a Time Lord. Come on.
MEL: A double pulse. Then you really are the Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's what I've been trying to tell you. Now yours.
MEL: I know about regeneration, of course.
DOCTOR: Mel?
MEL: But you're completely different. Nothing like you were. Face, height, hair, everything's changed.
DOCTOR: Yes. And I've become more of a fool too, it seems, Mel. Doesn't bode well for my seventh persona, being so completely taken in by the wretched Rani.
MEL: The Rani? Is that who hijacked the Tardis?
DOCTOR: But what does she want with me?
RANI: Where do you think you're going?
URAK: With you, mistress.
RANI: I told you not to enter my Tardis without permission. Now stay here.
DOCTOR: Strange matter.
MEL: Never heard of it.
DOCTOR: You should have, Mel. A Princeton physicist discovered it in your Earth year 1984.
MEL: Computers are my speciality, not nuclear physics.
DOCTOR: It's an incredibly dense form of matter. A lump the size of this would weigh more than your planet Earth.
MEL: Well, what can the Rani's interest be?
DOCTOR: An astute question. If that asteroid exploded, it would send off a blast of gamma rays equivalent to a supernova.
MEL: And then it'd be goodbye, Lakertya.
DOCTOR: And everything else in this corner of the galaxy. When the Rani dabbles, she dabbles on a grand scale.
DOCTOR: Here, go and listen.
MEL: It's weird. It's like a giant heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Yes. But why, Mel, why? What is she up to? It starts here.
MEL: Oh, forget it, Doctor. Let's hightail it back to the Tardis and get out of here.
DOCTOR: And leave the Lakertyans to the machinations
DOCTOR : Of the Rani? Impossible! Given time I'll work out the combination.
BEYUS: Nine five three.
DOCTOR: Did you hear a voice, or am I hallucinating?
BEYUS : Nine five three.
MEL: Well, go on, quick. Nine five three.
DOCTOR: Who'd have thought she'd have been so obvious. Huh. That's my age. And the Rani's.
RANI: The girl's on the loose. Find her before she finds the Doctor.
URAK: Yes, mistress.
MEL: Hypatia. Einstein!
BEYUS: Names which are meaningless to us.
DOCTOR: Geniuses, every one of them. The Rani's collected together the most creative minds and the most powerful matter in the universe.
FAROON: She's a murderess. Sarn was not her first victim. There've been many.
DOCTOR: The scope of her imagination is breathtaking.
BEYUS: You sound as though you admire her.
DOCTOR: Not admiration, fascination. And sadness. If only the Rani could have redirected her incredible talents for good.
MEL: The fascination's mutual. She's reserved this one for you.
DOCTOR: What is it I can contribute these other geniuses can't?
MEL: You're a Time Lord.
DOCTOR: With a unique conceptual understanding of the properties of time.
DOCTOR: Do you know what's behind that door?
BEYUS: I've never been permitted to see.
DOCTOR: Pity. Beyus, why have you assisted?
BEYUS: Collaborated is the word that you are avoiding, Doctor. I've no choice.
FAROON: She's coming!
DOCTOR: Take Mel.
FAROON: I'll take her with me.
MEL: Doctor, you can't stay.
DOCTOR: Go, Mel. Go.
DOCTOR: Ah yes, yes. Let me see. Polyethersulphone. Excellent. How clever you are, Mel. Where did you find it?
RANI: In the store room. Doctor, why was the monitor on?
DOCTOR: On, is it? Oh, yes. I was trying to jog my memory. No luck though. Hold the other end, Mel.
DOCTOR: You're not concentrating, Mel. Hold it steady. We've got to manoeuvre it into position.
RANI: Quite adept at manoeuvring, aren't you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, where there's a will, there's a Tom, Dick and a Harriet.
RANI: Do I take it the machine's now operational?
DOCTOR: Oh. no, no, no. There's some information I simply must have before I make the final delicate adjustments.
RANI: Such as?
DOCTOR: Ideally, what's behind that door?
RANI: Less ideally?
DOCTOR: The identity of this rather interesting substance.
RANI: The information's essential, is it?
DOCTOR: Crucial.
RANI: So if I told you its chemical composition, I could do that.
DOCTOR: No, stop!
RANI: You know, don't you.
RANI: But your usefulness is not yet over. You have another role to play.
Part Three
DOCTOR: I say, I mean, we may not see eye to eye. Try and see it my way. I'm trying not to be personal. I mean, after all, a bat may look at a Time Lord.
BEYUS: Doctor, hurry.
FAROON: She's looking for us.
MEL: Maybe, but I can think of a more likely explanation. The Doctor's on the loose. Whatever the reason, Faroon, you mustn't be caught with me.
FAROON: I can't leave you. I promised.
MEL: I'll be all right. Now go. Please.
BEYUS: No, you'll have to escape through the laboratory. The Rani went that way.
URAK : Mistress Rani?
URAK: You, Lakertyan, have you seen the mistress? Well, quickly, answer!
BEYUS: She went into the grounds.
URAK: Oh, out of my way. The mistress has profound insight, but I think she is mistaken to rely on any of your worthless race.
DOCTOR: I can't say I share the Rani's taste in pets.
BEYUS: The Tetraps are nobody's pets and you'd be wise not to forget it.
DOCTOR: This is what I'll never forget. Unique talents every one of them. The Rani's roamed the universe plucking these geniuses out of time, at the height of their powers and reducing them to the status of laboratory specimens.
BEYUS: Doctor, please hurry.
DOCTOR: Time, the concept of time. I'm sure that's at the heart of what she's up to. Otherwise why reserve a place for me, a Time Lord, in this abysmal parade.
BEYUS: If you're still here when she gets back, you'll find out from inside the cabinet.
DOCTOR: Which you will help her put me in.
BEYUS: If she catches you, yes.
DOCTOR: You know, Beyus, your collaboration with the Rani's difficult to understand.
BEYUS: My people are under threat. If you do manage to escape, go to the Centre of Leisure. You will find the reason there. Now hurry, Doctor.
BEYUS: Be careful, Doctor. The grounds outside are a minefield of traps.
DOCTOR: Nothing outside compared to this.
BEYUS: A harmless asteroid?
DOCTOR: It's composed of strange matter, Beyus. A devastating force. With the right trigger, that harmless asteroid, as you call it, could incinerate your planet and anything else in this corner of the galaxy. And what does the Rani keep behind there? Oh, all good things come to a bend.
DOCTOR: Microthermistor. I doubt if she'll have a spare.
BEYUS: She won't need one. You're going to put it back. Give it to me.
DOCTOR: I had no intention of hurting you.
RANI : Beyus!
RANI: Who sabotaged this? What happened?
BEYUS: Ah, my head.
RANI: Was it the Doctor?
BEYUS: I don't know. He tried to steal something from the cabinet. I tried to stop him.
URAK: The Mistress will be overjoyed to see you. You know where to take her.
IKONA : Stop! Don't take another step.
DOCTOR: Here's a turn up for the cook. A rock that talks.
IKONA: You must be the Doctor. I've met your companion, Mel.
DOCTOR: Don't hold that against me.
IKONA: Oh, I see where she gets her sense of humour. You're going to need it.
DOCTOR: That bad?
IKONA: Look down.
IKONA: Now step back, very slowly.
DOCTOR: Hello. Haven't I seen you hanging around somewhere?
RANI: Take her away.
RANI: Faroon? You can tell the Doctor he can have the girl in return for the microthermistor he stole.
FAROON: And where will I find this Doctor?
RANI: He'll make contact with the other Lakertyans and try to stir up trouble, so don't be taken in by his glib tongue.
BEYUS: Do as she says, Faroon. You know the penalty our people will have to pay if you disobey.
FAROON: But shouldn't we try to escape as Sarn did?
BEYUS: Faroon, I have obeyed all of the Rani's commands, carried out the most menial of tasks. Now that she has almost completed the experiment, why should I take the risk?
FAROON: And when her work is finished, what happens then?
BEYUS: She will leave Lakertya.
FAROON: Will she, Beyus?
BEYUS: That was her promise.
FAROON: And when she does?
BEYUS: Our lives will return to normal.
FAROON: Normal, Beyus? Without Sarn?
BEYUS: Faroon, deliver the message to the Doctor. I believe that you will find him in the Centre of Leisure.
DOCTOR: No restrictions for movement. The Lakertyans can come and go freely, then.
IKONA: Provided they obey the instructions of Beyus and don't try to get into the laboratory.
IKONA: The Centre of Leisure. The Centre of Indolence.
DOCTOR: Not a favourite haunt of yours, I take it, Ikona.
IKONA: No. I can't imagine why Beyus told you to come to this place.
DOCTOR: He said I'd find the answer to his subservience here.
IKONA: From these spineless pleasure seekers?
DOCTOR: Why not?
IKONA: It would require effort, that's why, Doctor. They've become spoon-fed drones. There's no need for them to strive. An indulgent system provides all. Well, didn't Beyus give you any clue as to what to look for?
DOCTOR: He was too anxious for explanations. But whatever the threat, it must be considerable. Do you see anything that's different? New?
IKONA: Only that. Another pointless embellishment.
DOCTOR: Hmm, I wonder. Couldn't we ask someone, you know, if
IKONA: We'll be interrupting their pleasure.
IKONA: Could you tell me what that globe's for?
IKONA: I did warn you.
DOCTOR: There's none so deaf as those that clutch at straws.
IKONA: If you say so. Lanisha!
LANISHA: Ikona.
IKONA: Lanisha. Can you tell me what that globe's for?
LANISHA: We've been forbidden to have anything to do with you, Ikona.
IKONA: You would ignore your own brother? 
LANISHA: I obey the orders of Beyus.
RANI: Do you recognise these?
URAK: Answer the mistress Rani!
BEYUS: They're from the fireworks that we used to have at our carnival.
RANI: These were fired at no carnival. These were used to enable the Doctor to escape.
URAK: Causing the death of a Tetrap.
BEYUS: None of my followers would be responsible.
RANI: You're careful not deny it's the work of a Lakertyan.
BEYUS: You will be punishing the innocent.
RANI: Guilt by association. I warned you of the consequences of subversion.
LAKERTYAN: Look out, they kill!
IKONA: Killer insects! Come on, Doctor.
FAROON: Do you still insist that Beyus should not count the cost of resistance, Ikona? If every cell in the globe were opened, there wouldn't be a Lakertyan left alive.
DOCTOR: Hmm, killer insects.
FAROON: Doctor, I have a message for you.
DOCTOR: Let Mel come towards me. I've kept my side of the bargain. You've got what you want.
URAK: So stupid. You are not a worthy opponent for the Rani.
DOCTOR: What's he crowing on about, Mel?
DOCTOR: A hologram! As substantial as the Rani's scruples.
RANI: As soon as the machine is operational, increase the brain stimulation.
BEYUS: But that would take it above the danger level.
RANI: I'm in danger of missing the solstice, which is far more important.
BEYUS: The computer control needs constant monitoring. I can't manage alone.
RANI: So I've anticipated, and I've got just the expert for you.
RANI: Beyus, she's your responsibility.
BEYUS: Mine? But I can't govern her. She's not a Lakertyan.
RANI: Just make certain she understands the penalty for non-cooperation.
IKONA: Doctor, in my opinion, returning to the laboratory is a pointless exercise. I've a feeling Mel's beyond all help.
DOCTOR: Oh, the Rani would never go to those extremes. She never does anything without reason.
IKONA: Well then, why the hologram? Why didn't she just release Mel?
DOCTOR: A bird in the hand keeps the Doctor away.
IKONA: You're probably right.
DOCTOR: Only on this occasion, it'll have the opposite affect.
RANI: The increase in brain activity is not enough. I'm going to miss the solstice.
URAK: Perhaps the stimulation of a greater genius. A brilliance that surpasses all others, mistress.
RANI: Do I gather you're suggesting that I climb into one of those cabinets?
URAK: Your capable presence is wasted in here and I could operate the machine.
RANI: Yes, I'm sure you could. Urak! Come with me.
RANI: Prepare the Doctor's cabinet for occupation.
MEL: Well, that'll be a waste of effort. You've got to find him first and then catch him.
RANI: I need neither find nor catch him. The bumbling fool's ready made as a sacrificial lamb.
MEL: He's shrewder than you think. Underestimating the Doctor is a common fault.
RANI: Really?
MEL: He's got qualities you'll never have.
RANI: Such as?
MEL: Something I'd call humanity.
RANI: Huh. You're as sentimental as he is. Get on with your work.
BEYUS: Don't antagonise her. She has only to press a button for every Lakertyan to be exterminated.
MEL: I could nominate a few candidates for extermination myself.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a space rocket launcher, sure enough. But have you noticed it's got a fixed trajectory?
IKONA: No doubt it'll still play havoc with our planet.
DOCTOR: Maybe as a side effect, Ikona, but not the intention. I'd say the target is the asteroid of strange matter, which means the launch is locked into a precise time.
IKONA: Could it be the solstice? That's due.
DOCTOR: Assuming it is, the Rani's overriding priority will be to meet that countdown. No more setbacks or delays. I must go back to the laboratory. That sealed chamber, I've got to get in there. Out of the frying pan into the mire. Right, Ikona, start the diversionary tactics.
IKONA: Have a care, Doctor. This bluff worked once. The Tetraps might not fall for it again.
URAK: We have been expecting you, Doctor.
MEL: We must be able to do something. Can't we make it blow a fuse?
BEYUS: What good would that do? At least he'll be kept alive in here.
MEL: Don't try to reason me into compliance, Beyus. You're wasting your breath.
MEL: Doctor!
URAK: You, Lakertyan. Connect this specimen to the main input.
MEL: No, leave him alone. I won't let you do
BEYUS: You have no choice.
BEYUS: Now, listen to me. They are completely without conscience. They will not hesitate to kill.
URAK: All went as you planned, mistress.
RANI: Good.
BEYUS: Set the temperature gauge, Mel.
MEL: I'm setting nothing.
BEYUS: Stubbornness will not help the Doctor.
MEL: And putting him in here will? Huh. Some twisted philosophy, if you like.
RANI: How far have you got?
BEYUS: I need to realign the final calibrations before he can be connected to the main input.
RANI: Make certain that the levels are kept stable.
MEL: If you're hoping for any positive results, you're going to be disappointed. The Doctor won't collaborate.
RANI: I'm sure, were he able, he'd express his appreciation of such unstinting confidence. As soon as the activity indicator reaches eight point one five, increase the stimulation.
BRAIN: To reproduce the Leptonic Era temperature of ten to the power of twelve K, it will be essential to create a cataclysmic explosion, the equivalent of a supernova.
RANI: Is this what you're looking for?
BRAIN: Our time dilation is not in question. Our understanding of time is still at a primitive stage.
RANI: It won't be once the Doctor has added his contribution.
MEL: No!
RANI: Beyus!
BEYUS : Yes?
RANI: Is the Doctor connected to the main input?
BEYUS: Everything is ready.
RANI: Then switch on!
MEL: No, Beyus! For once don't do as she
RANI: The Doctor's well-being is in your hands now. Remember that.
BRAIN: The barrier to understanding time is empirical thinking. I suggest a lateral approach.
Part Four
URAK: You, Lakertyan, you will be responsible for this creature's behaviour.
URAK: Time is getting short if we are to be ready for the solstice, mistress.
RANI: I'm aware of that.
URAK: The Doctor must have had assistance from a Lakertyan rebel.
RANI: Mmm.
URAK: Shall I release the insects and kill all the Lakertyans?
RANI: Too drastic.
URAK: It is uncharacteristic of the mistress to be sentimental.
RANI: Sentiment has nothing to do with it. Wasting a resource does. Until this experiment is successfully concluded I can't be certain that I won't need them as a labour force. Selective retribution will bring any dissidents to heel.
MEL: She might think she's harnessed the brain of a Time Lord but she's reckoned without one thing.
BEYUS: And what's that?
MEL: The Doctor's character.
MAN : I still assert that electron positron pairs can be prevented from recombining into photons.
DOCTOR : Really, this is not the place for double entendres.
WOMAN : You are all contributing gibberish.
MAN : My theory will provide the formula.
DOCTOR : A fool and his formula are soon parted.
MAN : Outrageous polemics.
DOCTOR : Gentlemen, such hostility. Remember, blessed are the pie makers for they shall make light pastry.
EINSTEIN: It is a fundamental postulate that all motion is relative.
DOCTOR : You wouldn't say that if you met my uncle.
MAN : Dismissing our position as decadent heresy is the refuge of the reactionary.
DOCTOR : Ah well, every dogma has its day.
RANI: I'll kill him!
WOMAN : It is stated in the special theory and has been demonstrated that an increase in velocity will increase matter.
RANI: I'll kill him!
DOCTOR : Exactly. The faster a fat man runs, the fatter he will get.
WOMAN : Well, of course
RANI: Quickly, disconnect the Doctor. The fool has provoked multiple schizophrenia.
MEL: Congratulations. You brought us here.
RANI: And I shall dispose of you. This will rid me of the pair of you.
DOCTOR: Quick, Mel, don't just stand there, help me!
RANI: Let go of me, you interfering maniac.
MEL: Give her a taste of her own medicine. Shall I switch on?
DOCTOR: No, Mel. Two wrongs don't make a left turn. Right.
RANI: Let me out! Let me out! Do you hear me?
MEL: Doctor, before this regeneration you were on keen on cats and you know what curiosity did to them.
DOCTOR: Leave the quotes to the expert, Mel.
DOCTOR: The rocket! It's a fixed trajectory.
MEL: It isn't all that will be fixed if we don't get out of here.
DOCTOR: So, the target is the asteroid, which at any moment now will reach the solstice and I'm sure that's the deadline. He who dares spins.
DOCTOR: Whoops. A supernova.
URAK: Put those on the legs of all the Lakertyans. Disobey and I will release the killer insects from the globe.
FAROON: Why are you doing this? We've cooperated.
URAK: Silence, Lakertyan! There have been too many unfriendly acts.
FAROON: Not by us. This is unjust. At least tell us what they're for.
URAK: I will demonstrate with the greatest of pleasure. You!
RANI: Beyus. Beyus, is that you? Let me out.
RANI: Do you hear me? Open this door. Beyus, if you place any value on your people's lives, you will release me.
IKONA: I'll try and contact the Doctor. We need his help.
DOCTOR: Do you realise how close the Rani must have taken her Tardis in order to record that?
MEL: All I realise is that we've seen what she intends to happen to Lakertya. Can she do it?
DOCTOR: Not by my reckoning. The only known detonator for exploding a strange matter asteroid is strange matter itself.
MEL: You said that strange matter was incredibly heavy.
DOCTOR: A lump the size of this brain would weigh as much as an entire planet.
MEL: Well, could she be using the brain to come up with a formula
DOCTOR: For a lightweight substitute. Could be, could be.
MEL: Well then, haven't we come up with the answer?
DOCTOR: Not completely. What I can't fathom is why the Rani took such an incredible risk to record a supernova.
MEL: To discover how to reconstruct the same event.
DOCTOR: No, more than that. She wouldn't be simply interested in a display of pyrotechnics. Too negative. No, there's a deeper motive and the answer's in here.
MEL: Well, calm down. Let's apply a bit of logic, shall we? What is it that you can contribute that those other geniuses can't?
DOCTOR: A knowledge of time. Oh, a great discovery. I worked that out ages ago.
RANI: So now you know.
DOCTOR: Not the complete story. The last chapter's missing. Keeping quiet, isn't it?
RANI: Perhaps, unlike you, it only speaks when it has something intelligent to say.
DOCTOR: Possibly. On the other hand it could be wondering why you want helium two. That's why you want to explode strange matter, isn't it? To reproduce helium two.
RANI: The last chapter, Doctor. The denouement.
RANI: In the aftermath of the explosion, helium two will fuse with the upper zones of the Lakertyan atmosphere to form a shell of chronons. I don't have to tell you what chronons are, do I, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Indeed you don't.  Discrete particles of time.
RANI: In the same millisecond that chronon shell is being formed, the hothouse effect of the gamma rays will cause the primate functions of the brain to go into chain reaction, multiplying until the gap between shell and planet is filled.
DOCTOR: A time manipulator. You're going to change this planet into a time manipulator.
RANI: A cerebral mass capable of dominating and controlling time anywhere in the cosmos.
DOCTOR: I don't believe it. A time manip. This monstrosity will give you the ability to change the order of creation.
RANI: Creation's chaotic. I shall introduce order. Wherever evolution has taken the wrong route, I shall redirect it. That planet you're so obsessed with, Earth, I shall return to the Cretaceous age. MEL: The cretaceous age?
RANI: The potential of the dinosaurs was never fully realised.
DOCTOR: That means Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Louis Pasteur, Elvis, even Mrs Malaprop will never have existed.
RANI : Your concern for these minions is pathetic. They're an inferior species.
DOCTOR : Thrust into the oblivion.
RANI: Why not?
DOCTOR : The same with Lakertya. All life on this planet will become extinct.
RANI : An unfortunate side effect.
DOCTOR : All living creatures left behind exterminated.
RANI : Of which you, Doctor, will be one.
DOCTOR : While you float off safely in your Tardis.
RANI: Oh, I shall be back once, the turbulence has subsided.
DOCTOR: Before I thought you were a psychopath without murderous intent. I withdraw the qualification.
BRAIN: Eighty seven K to the power of nineteen E correlated with fifty two to the power of six point four equals twenty nine V
DOCTOR: Thirty nine.
BRAIN: Correction is noted. Thirty nine V plus W. Eureka! Objective achieved. Loyhargil.
RANI: I knew it! I knew they could do it!
MEL: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Stay back!
DOCTOR: As you snore, so shall you sleep.
MEL: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Waste net, want net.
MEL: Come on!
MEL: About time, Ikona.
IKONA: Doctor, I've got to talk to you.
DOCTOR: And so you shall. You have a big part to play, Ikona. You must stir up the Lakertyans into fighting back. Come, quickly.
DOCTOR: The Doctor must be apprehended, mistress.
RANI: He is irrelevant. I have the Loyhargil. Nothing can stop me now.
IKONA: Unless you can tell them how to removes these bangles, they can't help.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You've got to give the Rani full marks for ingenuity.
IKONA: Perhaps if we're careful we can cut them.
MEL: Oh, that's a daft idea. They're bound to be booby trapped.
DOCTOR: Less of the pessimism, Mel. Not all the cards are in the Rani's flavour.
DOCTOR: Now, if we were to run a wire from here round to here, then the circuit wouldn't be broken when the bangle was open. Mel. You're the computer expert. How about it?
MEL: Where am I going to find the right sort of wire?
IKONA: Where there's a will, there's a
DOCTOR: Beneficiary. Good thinking, Ikona.
DOCTOR: Well done, Mel. Ikona, I'm relying on you to help the Lakertyans help themselves for once. Remove the bangles.
IKONA: Right.
FAROON: Doctor, haven't you overlooked something? If the Rani releases the insects, we'll all be dead.
DOCTOR: She's not the only one with a sting in her tail.
FAROON: Sting?
DOCTOR: Sting. A double bluff. A speciality of mine.
RANI: You'll stay on guard until after lift off.
URAK: After lift off, mistress?
RANI: You said yourself that the Doctor could still cause trouble. Remain here and see that he doesn't.
COMPUTER: One four nine.
URAK: And where is the mistress going?
RANI: To my Tardis. I want to monitor the experiment from there.
COMPUTER: One four six.
URAK: I would prefer to go with you.
RANI: No doubt, but you can't!
COMPUTER: One four two. One four one. One four oh. One three nine. One three eight. One three seven. One three six. One three five. One three four. One three three. One three two. One three one.
FAROON: Doctor.
BEYUS: Faroon, you were warned not to listen to him.
DOCTOR: When that voice reaches zero, there'll be nobody left on Lakertya to listen to me or anyone else.
FAROON: He's speaking the truth, Beyus.
COMPUTER: One two three. One two two.
BEYUS: What is it you want me to do?
DOCTOR: First see if there's anyone in there. Mel, all hands to the stumps.
MEL: Pumps.
COMPUTER: One one eight. One one seven.
DOCTOR: Ikona, take good care of him.
IKONA: He's someone important?
DOCTOR: They all are. Louis Pasteur. He will rid his world of a major scourge. He will save the lives of tens of millions.
FAROON: Doctor, come through.
DOCTOR: Whoops. Oh. Take them back to the Tardis.
IKONA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ikona.
COMPUTER: One two one. One hundred. Ninety nine.
COMPUTER: Ninety eight. Ninety seven. Ninety six. Ninety five. Ninety four.
COMPUTER: Ninety three, ninety two, ninety one.
COMPUTER: Ninety, eighty nine, eighty eight, eighty seven, eighty six, eighty five, eighty four, eighty three, eighty two, eighty one, eighty, seventy nine.
COMPUTER: Seventy four, seventy three, seventy two.
MEL: Doctor, we haven't a second to spare.
BEYUS: Mel's right, Doctor. I can finish here. You're the only one that can tackle the Rani.
DOCTOR: Don't leave it too late, Beyus.
BEYUS: I know what I have to do.
MEL: Doctor, come on.
BEYUS: Go with them, Faroon.
FAROON: But can't I wait with you, Beyus?
BEYUS: You've rarely questioned my actions before. This is the not the time to begin.
COMPUTER: Fifty nine, fifty eight, fifty seven
COMPUTER: Fifty six, fifty five, fifty four, fifty three
COMPUTER: Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen.
COMPUTER: Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven
COMPUTER: Four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four.
DOCTOR: Rani! It's over. You're beaten! I've aborted the launch and the Lakertyans are preparing to attack.
RANI: You imbecile. You've signed their death warrants.
COMPUTER: Four, four, four
COMPUTER: Three, two, one, lift off.
DOCTOR: The delay in lift off means the rocket will miss the asteroid.
MEL:  Are you certain?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A miss is as good as a smile.
DOCTOR: This way, ladies, gentlemen, others. I'll get you back to where you belong. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: I'll explain how it works later. It's all relative.
DOCTOR: Mel.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Faroon. When I think of Beyus I shall remember with admiration the sacrifice he made.
FAROON: He must have been convinced that it was the only way to be certain of saving the rest of us.
IKONA: He'll not be forgotten.
FAROON: Nor will you, Doctor.
MEL: Well, cheerio, Ikona.
IKONA: I wish I were coming with you.
MEL: No one will credit this, least of all you, but so do I.
IKONA: I do have another regret.
DOCTOR: What's that?
IKONA: After all the suffering she's caused, the Rani has escaped to freedom in her Tardis.
URAK: Mistress, you have taught us so much. When we return to Tetrapiriarbus, your incredible brain will show us how to overcome our needs. There will be plasma in abundance.
RANI: No.
DOCTOR: Memory like a dromedary.
DOCTOR: An antidote against those killer insects in the globe. The Rani always takes out an insurance policy.
MEL: You're impossible. Why did you do that?
IKONA: Tell her, Faroon.
FAROON: Ikona believes that our people should meet their own challenges, if they are to survive.
DOCTOR: Well, time and tide melts the snowman.
MEL: Waits for no man.
DOCTOR: Who's waiting? I'm ready.
MEL: You're certainly going to take a bit of getting used to.
DOCTOR: I'll grow on you, Mel. I'll grow on you.
