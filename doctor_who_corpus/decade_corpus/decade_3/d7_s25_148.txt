Remembrance of the Daleks
Part One
J F KENNEDY : Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future.
M L KING : I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
ACE: What's she staring at?
DOCTOR: Your clothing's a little anachronistic for this time period, and that doesn't help.
ACE: Well, it's not my fault this decade's got no street cred. I mean, look at that kid.
DOCTOR: Strange.
ACE: Oi, Professor, can we get something to eat now?
DOCTOR: You're not carrying any Nitro Nine explosives in there?
ACE: No.
DOCTOR: What do you make of that van?
ACE: Dunno. TV detector van?
DOCTOR: No. Wrong type of aerial. For this time period, that's a very sophisticated piece of equipment.
ACE: What's so sophisticated about that rig? I've seen better aerials on a CB. Professor, I'm hungry. Lack of food makes me hungry, you know.
DOCTOR: Lack of food makes you obstreperous. Why don't you go and buy some consumables? There's a cafe down there. While I undertake a detailed and scientific examination of that van that has so singularly failed to grab your attention.
ACE: Right.
DOCTOR: Ace!
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: Money.
ACE: Oh.
ACE: Thanks.
ACE: Service! Oi, anybody home?
MIKE: Not like that.
ACE: Like what, then?
MIKE: Like this. Oi, Harry! Customer! Like that.
ACE: Right.
HARRY : Coming.
MIKE: See? It's easy when you know how.
HARRY: Right, give it a rest, Mike. I had enough of that during the war Er, can I help you, miss?
ACE: Oh, yeah. Four bacon sandwiches and a cup of coffee, please.
HARRY: Four bacon sandwiches and a cup of coffee. Righty-o.
GIRL: Five six seven eight, it's a doc
DOCTOR: She doesn't talk to strangers. Very wise.
GIRL: Five, six, seven eight. It's a doctor at the gate.
RACHEL: Hmm, you took your time. Get on the radio and tell the Group Captain. I think I've located
DOCTOR: The source of magnetic fluctuation, perhaps.
RACHEL: A rhythmically pulsed fluctuation, yes.
DOCTOR: I thought so. Any possibility of natural phenomena?
RACHEL: Not likely. It's a repeated sequence.
DOCTOR: So, it's artificial in origin.
RACHEL: Yes. Excuse me?
DOCTOR: Yes?
RACHEL: Who are you?
DOCTOR: The Doctor.
RACHEL: I'm Rachel. Professor Rachel Jensen.
DOCTOR: How do you do? I'm sure I've heard of you.
GILMORE : Red Four, Red Four, come in please.
RACHEL: Red Four receiving. Listen, Group Captain, there's this man. What? On my way.
ACE: Twelve pennies to the shilling, eight shillings to the pound right?
MIKE: No, twenty shillings to the pound. That makes two hundred and forty pennies in a pound. Where are you from anyway?
ACE: Perivale. Why? Oh, this is a stupid system. Twelve pennies to the shilling, twenty shillings to the pound, right?
MIKE: Yeah. Are you from somewhere else?
ACE: No. So what's half a crown?
MIKE: Well that's easy
RACHEL : Sergeant!
ACE: Sergeant?
RACHEL: The Group Captain says he's under attack. We have to get moving.
DOCTOR: Ace, get in here!
RACHEL: Matthews is hurt.
MIKE: Where are they?
RACHEL: At the secondary source, Totters Lane.
Everyone say Hi! to the handsome, posh Simon Williams.)
MIKE: Military.
POLICEMAN: Fine, sir.
DOCTOR: What's the situation?
GILMORE: Who the devil are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor and this is Ace. You must be with the military.
GILMORE: Well, how do you know?
DOCTOR: I'm very perceptive.
GILMORE: Is he with you, Professor?
RACHEL: Yes.
GILMORE: Smith.
MIKE: Sir?
GILMORE: Take the girl and set up a position by Red Six.
MIKE: Yes, sir. Come on, Ace.
GILMORE: You'd better come and take a look.
DOCTOR: No evidence of tissue damage. Ah, massive internal displacement.
GILMORE: What?
DOCTOR: His insides were scrambled. Very nasty.
RACHEL: The effect of the blast?
DOCTOR: No. A projected energy weapon.
GILMORE: Projected what?
RACHEL: A death ray?
DOCTOR: Very succinct. I presume you've got reinforcements coming?
GILMORE: Any minute now.
GILMORE: This is preposterous. A death ray? It's unbelievable.
DOCTOR: What a predictable response.
MIKE: Miss Williams? Allison!
ALLISON: Sergeant, you're here at last. How's Matthews?
MIKE: He's dead. Is Blue One responding?
ALLISON: What? Blue One? Yes, they'll be here in a minute. Dead, are you sure?
DOCTOR: Whatever fired that weapon's trapped in there. There's no way out.
GILMORE: How can you be sure?
DOCTOR: I've been here before.
SERGEANT: Right, everybody out! Come on, quickly. Move it, move it. Squad, attention!
GILMORE: Stand at ease. Right, now the situation is this. we have an armed hostile pegged up in that lean-to shed. I want the squad to cover the entrance. No firing unless I give the command. Is that understood?
SOLDIERS: Yes, sir.
GILMORE: Remember, he's armed and hostile, so keep under cover as much as possible. Sergeant.
SERGEANT: Sir.
GILMORE: Detail some men to clear these civilians.
SERGEANT: Yes, sir. You two, come down with me and we'll sort this lot out. Now, let's have you all back as far as possible, please. Thank you, madam. There's nothing to be seen here.
GILMORE: Smith.
MIKE: Yes, sir?
GILMORE: Take two men and get Matthews out of here.
MIKE: Yes, sir. You two, fall out and follow me.
DOCTOR: I don't think you realise what you're dealing with here.
GILMORE: Doctor, I assure you these men are hand picked. They can deal with anything, provided they can see it. Right men, take up positions.
MIKE: Take his arms. Move him back to the truck.
DOCTOR: Down!
GILMORE: Covering fire now!
GILMORE: Get down!
RACHEL: What was it?
DOCTOR: That was your death ray.
RACHEL: I know that, but how? To transmit focused energy at that level, it's incredible. It's
DOCTOR: Yes?
RACHEL: It's beyond the realm of current technology.
GILMORE: If you can save the science lecture for a less precipitous moment. Now perhaps, Doctor, you could tell me what is going on?
DOCTOR: You must pull your men back now. It's their only chance.
GILMORE: It's preposterous. We can't disengage now. Whoever is in there, my men can handle it. Sergeant!
DOCTOR: Listen to me, Brigadier.
GILMORE: Group Captain. Group Captain Gilmore!
DOCTOR: Nothing you possess will be effective against what's in there!
SERGEANT: Sir?
GILMORE: Three men, rifle-grenades, even spread left right and centre. Fire on my command.
SERGEANT: Yes, sir.
DOCTOR: Captain, you're not dealing with human beings here.
GILMORE: What am I dealing with? Little green men?
DOCTOR: No, Little green blobs in bonded-polycarbite armour.
SERGEANT: Grenades are ready, sir.
DOCTOR: Group Captain Gilmore.
GILMORE: Fire.
DOCTOR: Humans.
SERGEANT: Fire!
ACE: That's some serious hardware. Did you see that, Professor? Unsophisticated, but impressive.
GILMORE: Smith!
MIKE: Sir?
GILMORE: Get on the radio. Call up Blue Four and Six. Tell Four to pick up an ambulance on the way.
MIKE: Yes, sir.
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter how many men you get here. It isn't going to make any difference.
GILMORE: Doctor, my men have just put three high-explosive grenades into a confined area. Nothing even remotely human could have survived that.
DOCTOR: That's the point group, Group Captain, it isn't even remotely human.
MIKE: Blue Four, Blue Four, this is Red Six. Come in, please.
BLUE FOUR : Red Six, receiving.
MIKE: Blue Four. Group Captain Gilmore requests that you pick up an ambulance and proceed to Bravo Delta.
GILMORE: Cease firing! Cease firing! Wait for a target!
GILMORE: Fire!
DOCTOR: Aim for the eyepiece! Ace, give me some of that Nitro Nine that you're not carrying. Quickly.
DOCTOR: And another.
ACE: It's my last can.
DOCTOR: I should hope so, too. Er, how long, the fuse?
ACE: Ten seconds.
DOCTOR: That's long enough.
GILMORE: When I tell you, head for the entrance. Take the girl with you.
RACHEL: Then what?
GILMORE: I'll meet you back at HQ. Go now, Rachel!
DOCTOR: Oi, Dalek! It's me, the Doctor. What's the matter? Don't you recognise your mortal enemy?
DOCTOR: Three, four, five, six.
GILMORE: Smith!
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Ace, you said ten seconds.
ACE: Nobody's perfect, Professor. Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I am. Can you drive?
ACE: Why?
DOCTOR: Good, I thought so. Get in there.
GILMORE: I want an emergency team here at the double. Put a guard on that thing. Inform command HQ we will be returning there at once. And I want a weapons team at the Coal Hill School.
MIKE: Sir.
GILMORE: And, Smith? I want them armed with ATRs.
MIKE: Yes, sir.
RACHEL: It has an organic content.
ALLISON: Or an occupant.
GILMORE: What the devil is it?
DOCTOR: A Dalek. Only trouble is, it's the wrong Dalek.
ACE: Would the right one be better or worse?
DOCTOR: Yes. Choke.
ACE: No, thanks.
MIKE: What do you think you're doing?
DOCTOR: Borrowing your van.
ACE: These Day-leks
DOCTOR: Daleks.
ACE: Oh, Daleks. Where are they from?
DOCTOR: From Skaro. At least, originally. They're the mutated remains of a species called the Kaleds. Left here.
ACE: When were they left here?
DOCTOR: No. Turn left here.
ACE: Oh, right.
DOCTOR: No, left! You've missed the turning.
ACE: What turn? Where?
DOCTOR: Why don't you concentrate on where you're going?
ACE: Look, I'm doing the best I can. If you don't like it, you drive.
DOCTOR: The Kaleds were at war with the Thals. They had a dirty nuclear war. The resulting mutations were then accelerated by their chief scientist, Davros. What he created them he then placed them in a metal war machine, and that's how the Daleks came about
ACE: So that metal thing had a creature inside controlling it?
DOCTOR: Exactly. And ever since the Daleks were created, they've tried to conquer and enslave as much as the universe as they can get their grubby protuberances on.
ACE: And now they want to conquer the Earth.
DOCTOR: Nothing so mundane. They conquer the Earth in the twenty second century. No. They want the Hand of Omega.
ACE: What's that?
DOCTOR: One thing at a time, Ace.
MIKE: Sir?
GILMORE: Yes, Sergeant, what is it? Who is this man?
MIKE: Sorry, sir. This is Mister Ratcliffe. He's brought some of his men, I think they can be of some use to us.
GILMORE: You do, do you? Mister Ratcliffe.
RATCLIFFE: Please to meet you, sir.
RACHEL: We must get that Dalek to a well-equipped laboratory.
ALLISON: And a half decent biologist. R
ACHEL: What do you do think we should do?
ALLISON: You're the Chief Scientific Advisor. It's your decision.
RACHEL: Before I make any suggestions I want to catch up with the Doctor.
ALLISON: Who is he, anyway?
RACHEL: Someone who knows a lot more about Daleks then we do. When I get hold of him, I'm going to get some answers out of him or
ALLISON: Or what?
RACHEL: I'll set you onto him.
ALLISON: He certainly seems to have a detailed knowledge of the Daleks, and given that they are not terrestrial, it is possible that he is
RACHEL: Not of this Earth? An alien?
ALLISON: I just wish he was more obvious. You know, had green skin or antennae sticking out of his head or something.
HEADMASTER: Ah.
DOCTOR: Good afternoon.
HEADMASTER: And you would be?
DOCTOR: The Doctor. And you?
HEADMASTER: I'm the Headmaster here. Doctor, eh? Well, you're a bit over-qualified for the position, but if you would like to leave your particulars and references.
DOCTOR: References?
HEADMASTER: You are here for the job of school caretaker?
DOCTOR: Oh, no. We're here for a completely different reason.
HEADMASTER: Oh. What can I do for you, then?
DOCTOR: Well, we would like to look round your school, if you don't mind?
HEADMASTER: I'm afraid that's out of the question.
DOCTOR: We've got reason to believe there is a great evil at work somewhere in this school.
HEADMASTER: You'll have to be a bit more specific, Doctor.
HEADMASTER: But I don't think it would do any harm if you were to have just a quick look round.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
HEADMASTER: My pleasure.
GILMORE: Smith.
MIKE: Sir?
GILMORE: Are the anti-tank rockets being issued?
MIKE: They're being taken direct to their position, sir. An additional consignment is going to the school.
GILMORE: Good. Any news of the Doctor's whereabouts?
MIKE: Red Four has been seen in the Coal Hill area, sir.
GILMORE: He must be heading back to the school.
RACHEL: What is happening about the Dalek?
MIKE: Don't worry. It's under guard. It's safe.
RATCLIFFE: Right, get the tarpaulin over it. Come on, lads. Let's see you move. Right, let's go.
ACE: You were expecting these Daleks, weren't you?
DOCTOR: Yes, they're following me.
ACE: I wouldn't be so pleased if I had a bunch of Daleks on my case.
DOCTOR: You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.
DOCTOR: Come and look at this.
DOCTOR: What do you make of that?
ACE: It's a playground.
DOCTOR: The burn marks. See them? Well?
ACE: A landing pattern for some kind of spacecraft, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Very good.
ACE: But this is Earth, 1963. Well, someone would have noticed. I'd have heard about it.
DOCTOR: Do you remember the Zygon gambit with the Loch Ness Monster? Or the Yetis in the Underground?
ACE: The what?
DOCTOR: Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched by only its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself .
ACE: If the Daleks are following you, what are they after?
DOCTOR: When I was here before, I left something behind.
ACE: You mean the Hand of Omega?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: What is the Hand of Omega?
DOCTOR: Something very dangerous.
COMPUTER : Report.
RATCLIFFE: My men have recovered the machine. The Doctor is co-operating with the military.
COMPUTER: That is to be expected. I must be informed of his movements.
RATCLIFFE: Yes, yes. We have our contacts. I shall see that he is followed. That Dalek machine.
COMPUTER: Yes?
RATCLIFFE: I should like to know exactly what it is?
COMPUTER: A machine, a tool. Nothing more.
ACE: What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: Shush. Whoever it was landed the spaceship in the playground.
ACE: And that would be?
DOCTOR: More Daleks.
ACE: Oh, great. I thought it might be something really nasty.
DOCTOR: Ah, the cellar. It could be down in there.
ACE: Why the cellar?
DOCTOR: Good place to put things, cellars.
ACE: I wish I had some Nitro Nine.
DOCTOR: So do I.
ACE: What are you expecting to find down here, anyway?
DOCTOR: The unknown.
ACE: Oh. Isn't that a bit dangerous?
DOCTOR: Probably. But then if I knew what was down here, I wouldn't have to look.
ACE: This is some severe technology.
DOCTOR: Yes. Very elegant, very advanced. Flux circuitry elements.
ACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's a transmat. A matter transmitter. But transmitting from where? Within about three hundred kilometres.
ACE: Professor? Professor, something's activating it.
DOCTOR: Very likely. It has an automatic activator. What? You're right. Something is beginning to come through.
ACE: It's another Dalek.
DOCTOR: Excellent.
ACE: Will this one be friendly?
DOCTOR: I sincerely doubt that. If I can just get the transmitter to de-phase at the critical point.
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Any moment now. Quick! Down!
ACE: The controls have gone dead.
DOCTOR: Yes, the de-phase must have caused an overload.
ACE: What did you do to it?
DOCTOR: Well, I persuaded one half of the Dalek to materialise where its other half was materialising. The two halves tried to co-exist at the same point. The resulting reaction destroyed it. Dangerous things, transmats.
ACE: So no more Daleks can be transported through here?
DOCTOR: Well, it'll slow them down a bit until the operator can repair the systems.
ACE: The operator?
DOCTOR: Yes, the Daleks usually leave an operator on station in case of any malfunctions.
ACE: And that would be another Dalek?
DOCTOR: Yes.
DALEK: Stay where you are! Do not move!
DOCTOR: The stairs!
ACE: Oh, sorry.
DOCTOR : Ace! Ace! Open the door! Ace! Open
DALEK: You are the Doctor. You are the enemy of the Daleks! You will be exterminated! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
Part Two
DALEK : Exterminate! Exterminate!
DALEK : Exterminate!
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What's the matter with him?
ACE: Stomach ace.
DOCTOR: School dinners. Give me a hand.
ACE: Professor, he tried to lock you in.
DOCTOR: Ace!
HEADMASTER: I'm sorry.
DALEK: We must repair the transmat.
HEADMASTER: Yes.
DOCTOR: What are you doing here? Oh, never mind. Get this thing out of here.
AIRMAN: I was ordered to deliver the ATRs to this position, sir.
DOCTOR: ATRs. Anti-tank rockets.
AIRMAN: Yes, sir.
ACE: Will these things be any good against the Daleks?
DOCTOR: It's not the Daleks we're after, it's the transmat.
DALEK: You will remain here.
AIRMAN: You'll have to sign for them, sir.
AIRMAN: Ahem.
DOCTOR: Come on.
AIRMAN: Hello, love.
ACE: What about the Dalek? Won't he try and stop us?
DOCTOR: Quite possibly. Stay close behind.
ACE: Hey. It must have gone back down to the cellar.
DALEK: You will be exterminated.
DOCTOR: Ace, get down!
DALEK: Exterminate!
ACE: Ace.
DOCTOR: You destroyed it.
ACE: I aimed for the eye-piece.
MIKE: This way! Move it, move it! You fetch the Group Captain. Any more?
DOCTOR: No.
MIKE: Did you do that?
ACE: It makes a lot of smoke, doesn't it.
MIKE: Yeah.
GILMORE: You've destroyed it. Good.
DOCTOR: It is not good. Nothing about this is good. I've made a grave error of judgment. Oh, I'm going to wish I'd never started all this. Group Captain, I must ask you to evacuate the immediate area.
GILMORE: That's an absurd idea.
RACHEL: Why, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I've reason to believe a major Dalek Task Force could soon be operating here.
ALLISON: Great.
GILMORE: And where will this Task Force arrive from?
DOCTOR: One certainly is in place hidden somewhere in this vicinity. The other probably from a mothership in geostationary orbit.
GILMORE: Be reasonable, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Do you doubt the non-terrestrial nature of the Daleks? I mean, examine this one. Or better still, ask your Scientific Advisor.
GILMORE: Well, Professor?
RACHEL: I'm afraid the Doctor's right. It is alien.
GILMORE: You're positive?
RACHEL: Yes.
GILMORE: Professor, a word. This Doctor, do you trust him?
RACHEL: Well, he knows what he's talking about, and considerably more than he's telling us. I think we should go along with him for now.
GILMORE: And later?
RACHEL: We could ask him for an explanation.
GILMORE: We could do a lot more than ask. Very well, Doctor. I'll have to get a decision about this evacuation from my superiors.
DOCTOR: Splendid.
GILMORE: I should know either way by tomorrow morning. I'll see you all then.
 DOCTOR: I shouldn't touch it if I were you. It may not be completely dormant yet.
ALLISON: That stench.
RACHEL: Now, Doctor, I have questions I would like answered.
DOCTOR: So have I. I'll return in the morning.
ACE: Doctor, where are you going?
DOCTOR: To bury the past.
ACE: I'm coming with you.
DOCTOR: It is not your past. You haven't been born yet. Would someone look after Ace for me?
RACHEL: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: I'll borrow this.
RACHEL: Sergeant, have you room for Ace at your house?
MIKE: Yeah, sure. Mum runs a boarding house. I'd like you to meet her.
RACHEL: Ace?
ACE: Yes?
RACHEL: Not been born yet. What did he mean by that?
JOHN: Can I help you?
DOCTOR: A mug of tea, please.
JOHN: Cold night tonight.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Bitter, very bitter. Where's Harry?
JOHN: Visiting his missus. She's in hospital.
DOCTOR: Of course. It'll be twins.
JOHN: Hmm? Your tea. Sugar?
DOCTOR: Ah. A decision. Would it make any difference?
JOHN: It would make your tea sweet.
DOCTOR: Yes, but beyond the confines of my tastebuds, would it make any difference?
JOHN: Not really.
DOCTOR: But
JOHN: Yeah?
DOCTOR: What if I could control people's tastebuds? What if I decided that no one would take sugar? That'd make a difference to those who sell the sugar and those that cut the cane.
JOHN: My father, he was a cane cutter.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Now, if no one had used sugar, your father wouldn't have been a cane cutter.
JOHN: If this sugar thing had never started, my great-grandfather wouldn't have been kidnapped, chained up, and sold in Kingston in the first place. I'd be a African.
DOCTOR: See? Every great decision creates ripples, like a huge boulder dropped in a lake. The ripples merge, rebound off the banks in unforeseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences.
JOHN: Life's like that. Best thing is just to get on with it.
DOCTOR: Did you see that?
JOHN: See what?
DOCTOR: Nothing. What would you do if you had a decision, a big decision?
JOHN: How big?
DOCTOR: Saving the world.
JOHN: Really?
DOCTOR: Really.
JOHN: I wish you the best of luck.
DOCTOR: Let's hope I make the right decision. Things could get unpleasant round here. I'd take a holiday if I were you.
JOHN: Oh, sure. How long?
DOCTOR: Two or three days. After that, it won't matter one way or the other. Thanks for the tea.
JOHN: Any time.
JOHN: Nineteen ninety one? 
DOCTOR: Good morning. I believe this belongs to you.
MARTIN: Yes.
DOCTOR: The door was open so I thought I'd just pop in and collect my casket.
MARTIN: Ah, well, I'm the governor has yet to arrive and I'm afraid I can't just let you. Which er, casket would this be?
MARTIN: Oh, I see. Er, well, if you could just wait until the governor arrives, I'm sure
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be perfectly all right.
MARTIN: Oh, good. Splendid. Mister er
DOCTOR: Doctor.
MARTIN: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. Now, if I might be alone with the
MARTIN: Oh, yes, yes, of course. I'll leave you alone with, er.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
MARTIN: I'll just be in the next room if you
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: Hello. Open.
MARTIN: Hello, governor? Somebody's come to collect that big casket. Yes. Yes, the Doctor. Just one thing, governor. I thought you said he was an old geezer with white hair.
DOCTOR: Now, let's see what you can make of this.
ACE: Hello.
MIKE: Good morning.
ACE: Where are you off to?
MIKE: I have to check some things out at the Association.
ACE: Who's the Association?
MIKE: They're my friends. You can meet them later.
DOCTOR: Come on, now. Give it up.
DOCTOR: Goodbye. Close.
DOCTOR: Follow me.
MARTIN: Yes, all right, governor.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
MARTIN: Oh, cheerio, Doctor. But Doctor, what about your
RATCLIFFE: Once we possess this Hand of Omega, what then?
COMPUTER: We shall be on the brink of great power.
RATCLIFFE: And our agreement?
COMPUTER: You too shall share this power, if you have the stomach for it.
RATCLIFFE: What do you mean?
COMPUTER: There will be casualties. Many deaths.
RATCLIFFE: War is hell.
DOCTOR: It's very good of you to do this at such short notice.
VICAR: Nonsense, my dear Doctor. The grave's been ready for a month. Mister Stevens, the gravedigger, was wondering what he should do.
DOCTOR: I had to leave suddenly.
VICAR: Forgive me for saying this, but it seems to me that your voice has changed somewhat since we last met.
DOCTOR: Yes, it has changed. Several times.
VICAR: I must say your pallbearers are very quiet. Silent as ghosts, really.
DOCTOR: Yes.
RATCLIFFE: Yes? Good. Stay with the Doctor. Watch him and call me back. Ah, ah, ah. Yours not to reason why, just to obey orders. Now just get on with it.
RATCLIFFE: My man has found it.
COMPUTER: Yes, but my enemies have found your man.
DALEK : He is an agent of the renegade Daleks. Apprehend and interrogate. 
HEADMASTER: I obey.
HEADMASTER: What is the location of the renegade Dalek base?
MIKE: What? Get off me or I'll break
HEADMASTER: What is the location of the renegade Dalek base?
MIKE: I don't know what you're talking about.
HEADMASTER: Renegade Daleks have defied the will of the Emperor Dalek. They must be located and destroyed. And you are an agent of the renegade Daleks.
MIKE: I work for Mister Ratcliffe. The Association.
MIKE: Who do you work for?
DALEK : Alert. Security is compromised. Terminate agent. 
HEADMASTER: No!
MIKE: Who do you work for?
VICAR: It is over.
DOCTOR: No. It's only just beginning.
ALLISON: Thank you.
ACE: The Professor said he'd be back by now.
RACHEL: What was he doing, anyway?
DOCTOR: Working, unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Have a nice sleep?
ACE: It was okay. You're late.
MIKE: I found him wandering the streets.
DOCTOR: I was not wandering the streets. I was merely contemplating certain local cartographic anomalies.
MUM: There's a message for you, Mike.
MIKE: Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, the Group Captain is expecting us.
ACE: Great. Something to do at last.
MIKE: Ah. He specifically ordered that Ace remain here.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Ah, Ace, I have a present for you.
RACHEL: How did you do that?
DOCTOR: Higher technology, and no, I can't tell you how.
RACHEL: Why not?
DOCTOR: You're not ready for it. No one on this planet is.
MIKE: Ladies? Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'll meet you outside.
MIKE: Sorry, Ace. Work to be done. Back at six. Have dinner ready.
ACE: Toe rag. Professor, you can't leave me here.
DOCTOR: Ace, I'm trying to convince Group Captain Gilmore to keep his men out of trouble, otherwise there'll be a lot of needless deaths.
ACE: You're up to something.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: Then I have to come with you.
DOCTOR: No.
ACE: Who else is going to guard your back?
DOCTOR: Will you obey me this once? I'll explain everything when I return.
ACE: Tell me now!
DOCTOR: I haven't got the time!
ACE: All right, I'll stay here if that's what you want.
DOCTOR: Trust me.
ACE: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: You'd better explain when you get back, or
DOCTOR: Or?
ACE: Things could get nasty.
MIKE: I wonder what he's up to?
RACHEL: Who knows? His motives are alien.
MIKE: Meaning?
RACHEL: Meaning I don't think he's human.
MIKE: And Ace?
RACHEL: She's not an alien. You're all right there.
MIKE: Good. Well, I mean, I wouldn't want her to be foreign, would I?
RACHEL: Ah, here comes the Doctor.
COMPUTER: The enemy is about to start moving.
RATCLIFFE: Do you think that Group Captain Gilmore suspects us?
COMPUTER:  Not the paltry military forces of your world. The real enemy. The Imperial Dalek faction, may their shells be blighted. Soon it will be war. Are you ready for war, Mister Ratcliffe?
RATCLIFFE: Yes. This country fought for the wrong cause in the last war. When I spoke out, they had me imprisoned.
COMPUTER: You will be on the right side in this war.
DOCTOR: Group Captain, the evacuation?
GILMORE: I've been in direct contact with High Command and they've agreed to stage a quiet withdrawal under the peace time nuclear accident provisions. They felt that given the sensitive stage of the current government
ALLISON: Just for a change.
GILMORE: They felt, Miss Williams, that the initial stages could be carried out under the aegis of the Counter-Intrusion Measures, United Kingdom. The D-notice office has of course been informed and a cover story prepared.
RACHEL: What is it?
GILMORE: I have no idea. Not my department. Now, Doctor, since you hold my career in your hands, I trust you can justify my faith.
DOCTOR: With respect, Group Captain, your career's magnificently irrelevant. Now, let's see. Any more transmission sites?
RACHEL: No, just at the school.
DOCTOR: Good. I want a direct line to Jodrell Bank. Let's see. 1963. The Fylingdale installations and the Royal Observatory. Order them to search these localities for any signs of high orbital activity.
DOCTOR: Now, I want the detector vans moved so they can cover this area here and here. Order all air and ground forces to avoid engaging the enemy at all costs. We must act with extreme caution.
ALLISON: And if we don't?
DOCTOR: Goodbye civilisation as you know it.
ACE: Mrs Smith?
MUM : Yes?
ACE: I'm just going out for a breath of fresh air.
MUM : All right, dear.
ANNOUNCER: This is BBC television. The time is a quarter past five and Saturday viewing continues with an adventure in the new science fiction series, Doc
DOCTOR: Twenty six by zero zero one. A big mothership of some kind, with maybe as many as four hundred Daleks on board. Well, at least we know where it is.
RACHEL: Much good that does us.
GILMORE: It would be foolish of me, I suppose, to hope that this mothership was not nuclear capable?
DOCTOR: That ship has weapons capable of cracking open this planet like an egg.
ALLISON: We've got the parts you wanted, Doctor. Where do you want them?
DOCTOR: Good. Over here.
RACHEL: Allison, we've located the mothership. It's in a powered geostationary orbit
MIKE: Where?
RACHEL: Guess.
RACHEL: Right.
GILMORE: Is that their main base, Doctor?
DOCTOR: For one group, at least. I believe we're dealing with two antagonistic Dalek factions.
RACHEL: Two?
GILMORE: And do they both come from outer space?
DOCTOR: From another planet in a distant future. We must try and contain them, let them destroy each other.
GILMORE: Shouldn't we send for reinforcements? Armoured units?
DOCTOR: Have you been listening to me, Group Captain? That spaceship up there has surveillance equipment capable of spotting a sparrow fall at fifteen thousand kilometres. Any sign of a military build-up and they may simply decide to sterilise the area.
GILMORE: And we have no defence.
DOCTOR: Frightening, isn't it, to find there are others better versed in death than human beings.
ACE: Hello? Anyone at home?
DALEK : Attack squad in position.
DALEK 2 : Lower area clear.
DALEK : Proceed. Exterminate any aliens.
DALEKS : We obey.
RACHEL: What does it do?
DOCTOR: Well, at best it will interfere with the Dalek's control systems. I rigged something like it on Spiridon.
RACHEL: And the worst?
DOCTOR: It'll do absolutely nothing.
ALLISON: Doctor? Red Nine reports an increase in modulated signalling.
DOCTOR: Where?
ALLISON: Just a minute.
DOCTOR: Mike, phone up Ace and tell her someone will come and collect her.
MIKE: Right.
ALLISON: The signal emanates from Coal Hill School. Multiple sources in close proximity.
DOCTOR: Multiple? They've got the transmat working again.
RACHEL: Transmat? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: More Daleks.
GILMORE: Doctor, there's no reply from my men at the school.
DOCTOR: Get a vehicle ready. Load it up with plastic explosives and integral detonators.
GILMORE: Right.
RACHEL: Why explosives?
DOCTOR: Well, that thing merely disorients and weakens them. What do you expect me to do then, talk to them sternly?
MIKE: Doctor, Mum says that Ace left ages ago.
DALEK: Small human female sighted on level three.
ACE: Who are you calling small?
DALEK: Under attack. Under attack.
DALEK: Vision impaired.
DALEK: Reinforcements requested.
DALEK: Human female is now leaving building.
DALEK 2: Stay where you are. Do not move.
DALEK: Exterminate. Exterminate.
DALEK 3: Exterminate.
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.
Part Three
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.
MIKE: You, move in.
MIKE: Fall back. Fall back!
DOCTOR: It works. It works!
MIKE: Fall back! Three, two, one, down!
DOCTOR: There were living beings in there.
MIKE: Not any more.
GILMORE: Come on, Sergeant. We'll search upstairs.
MIKE: Yes, sir. Doctor, may I?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sergeant.
GILMORE: Right.
MIKE: Stay sharp. Follow me.
RACHEL: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
RACHEL: This one's still active.
DOCTOR: Oh? Let's see, Professor.
DOCTOR: Allison, it's dead. Thank you.
RACHEL: What was that?
DOCTOR: They've mutated again. Here, come and have a look. Compare that to the destroyed Dalek at Totter's Lane. Note the difference.
RACHEL: The other Dalek was underdeveloped, with vestigial limbs and sensory organs almost amoeboid. Allison, look. This is altogether different. It has functional appendages and some kind of mechanical prosthesis grafted into its very body. I think I'm going to be sick.
DOCTOR: Sergeant Smith must have found some more Daleks.
ACE: Don't anyone give me a hand.
ALLISON: Ace, you're hurt.
ACE: I had an argument with a window.
DOCTOR: You two go down and check the cellar, but don't touch anything. I'll look after Ace.
DOCTOR: When I say stay put, I mean stay put, not take on an entire Dalek assault squad single-handed. What were you doing here, anyway?
ACE: I came to get my tape deck.
DOCTOR: Where is it?
ACE: It's in little bits.
DOCTOR: Good.
ACE: Good? Ow. What do you mean, good. Where am I going to get another one?
DOCTOR: That tape deck was a dangerous anachronism. If someone had found it and discovered the principles of its function, the whole microchip revolution would take place now, twenty years too early, with incalculable damage to the time line.
ACE: So?
DOCTOR: So? Ace, the Daleks have a mothership up there capable of eradicating this planet from space, but even they, ruthless though they are, would think twice before making such a radical alteration to the time line.
DOCTOR: There, you ought to be able to get up and walk about now.
ACE: Cheers, Professor.
DALEK: Bridge reporting. Mothership will maintain Earth geostationary orbit. All systems fully operational. Attack squad Delta prepare to enter transmat.
ALLISON: The subject obviously is placed on that dais. Then what?
RACHEL: The Doctor called it a transmat. What's that imply to you?
ALLISON: Matter transmission? But that's impossible.
RACHEL: Impossible. You know, after this is over I'm going to retire and raise begonias.
DOCTOR: Lovely flowers, begonias.
ALLISON: Doctor, how exactly does this thing work?
RACHEL: Don't bother.
DOCTOR: It's a link for the Daleks, allowing them to beam death squads onto Earth without anybody knowing. And I don't want them here just yet.
DOCTOR: Weapons. Always useless in the end. Oh, you look hungry. How about lunch?
ACE: Professor, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Concentrating.
ACE: Harry, I wanted some toast.
HARRY: Coming, coming.
ACE: May I?
MIKE: Hello, Ace.
ACE: Hi.
MIKE: You've met Paul, John.
ACE: Hello.
RATCLIFFE: Argh!
DALEK: Power source detected. Alert! Power source detected. Full alert!
DALEK 2: It is the Hand of Omega.
DALEK 3: Inform the Emperor Dalek.
DALEK: I obey.
GILMORE: I just feel we should be doing something.
RACHEL: Frankly, I wouldn't advise it, Group Captain. We're in way over our heads.
GILMORE: You were hired as a Chief Scientific Advisor. One tends to expect advise from one's advisors.
RACHEL: For one thing, Group Captain, I was not hired, I was drafted. And for another, do you think I am enjoying having some space vagrant come along and tell me that the painstaking research I've devoted my life to has been superceded by a bunch of tin plated pepperpots?
GILMORE: Steady on.
RACHEL: Steady on? You drag me down from Cambridge, you quote the Peace Time Emergency Powers Act at me, and then you expect me to advise on something outside the realm of human experience. Bluntly, Group Captain, we're reliant on the Doctor because only the Doctor knows what is going on.
RATCLIFFE: Get on with it. I want that coffin back at the warehouse.
MAN: Guv.
RATCLIFFE: What are you staring at?
DALEK: Emperor on the bridge.
EMPEROR: Report.
DALEK: The transmat is no longer operational.
DALEK 2: We have established the position of the Omega device.
EMPEROR: Prepare the assault shuttle.
DALEK 2: Renegade Dalek agents are in the area.
EMPEROR: They will surrender the Hand of Omega.
RATCLIFFE: Haven't you got a home to go to? Come on, lads, put your backs into it. We haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Group Captain, we need to establish a forward base at the school. Can it be done?
GILMORE: Of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you for your cooperation.
GILMORE: Only a fool argues with his doctor. Sergeant!
MIKE: Sir?
GILMORE: Get Embery. Set up a command unit. Forward command on the third floor, defensive positions on the ground floor and the roof. Get a move on.
MIKE: Yes, sir. All right, men, fall out. Follow me back to the school.
GILMORE: Professor Jensen, Miss Williams, follow me.
ALLISON: Jawohl. Coming, Professor Jensen?
RACHEL: Of course, Miss Williams.
ALLISON: I wish Bernard was here.
RACHEL: The British Rocket Group's got its own problems.
ACE: Harry, toast.
HARRY: Coming, coming.
ACE: What's so important about the school?
DOCTOR: Well, now that I've disabled the transmat, absolutely nothing. As long as the renegade Daleks have got the Hand of Omega, then the Imperial Daleks' attention will be focused on that.
ACE: So there are two sets of Daleks.
DOCTOR: Yes.
RATCLIFFE: We have the Hand of Omega. It's out in the yard.
COMPUTER: Excellent.
RATCLIFFE: Good. I'll tell my man. After all, he found it.
ALLISON: Mike? There's a phone call for you in the Headmaster's office.
MIKE: Thanks.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: If this place is so out of the way of the action, what are we doing here?
DOCTOR: Keeping an eye on Group Captain Chunky Gilmore. Although why his men call him Chunky, I've no idea.
ACE: They're really going for it.
DOCTOR: That's the general idea. I want to keep the military fully occupied and out of the way.
ACE: Out of the way of what? Oh, Professor, you promised me, remember?
DOCTOR: A long time ago, on my home planet of Gallifrey, there lived a stellar engineer called Omega.
ACE: Stellar? As in stars? You mean he engineered stars?
DOCTOR: Ace!
ACE: Sorry. Go on.
DOCTOR: It was Omega who created the supernova that was the initial power source for Gallifreyan time travel experiments. He left behind him the basis on which Rassilon founded Time Lord society, and he left behind the Hand of Omega.
ACE: His hand? What good was that?
DOCTOR: No, no, not his hand literally. No, no, it's called that because Time Lords have an infinite capacity for pretension.
ACE: I've noticed that.
DOCTOR: The Hand of Omega is a mythical name for Omega's remote stellar manipulator, a device used to customise stars with. And didn't we have trouble with the prototype.
ACE: We?
DOCTOR: They.
ACE: And the Daleks want it so they can recreate the time travel experiments? But you said that both Dalek factions can already travel in time.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, Daleks have got time corridor technology, but it's very crude and nasty. What they want is the power that Time Lords have, and they'll get that with the Hand of Omega, or so they think.
ACE: And you have to try and stop them.
DOCTOR: No, Ace, I want them to have it.
ACE: Eh?
DOCTOR: My problem is trying to stop Group Captain Gilmore and his men getting diced in the crossfire.
ACE: So, all this is
DOCTOR: A massive deception, yes.
ACE: Oh, well devious. So the Daleks grab the Hand of Omega and go, and no one gets hurt. Brilliant.
DOCTOR: Just one thing.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: I didn't expect two Dalek factions, and now I've got to make sure the wrong ones don't get their grubby little protuberances on it.
ACE: Shouldn't we take Mike?
DOCTOR: No. Dalek hunting is a terminal pastime.
ACE: So what are we doing?
DOCTOR: Dalek hunting.
BLACK: Advance.
BLACK: Stay where you are.
RATCLIFFE: It's been a long and difficult struggle for myself and my men. Now we can afford to relax and reap the rewards. As I said, people need a firm hand. It's in their nature. They feel more comfortable with a strong leader, someone who knows when to be lenient and when to be harsh.
RATCLIFFE: What have you done to those men? They were on our side!
COMPUTER: You are a slave, Ratcliffe.
GIRL: You were born to serve the Daleks.
BLACK: Patrol the area until the time controller is operational.
GREYS: We obey.
BLACK: You will obey the Daleks or you will be exterminated. Activate the time controller.
GIRL: Time controller activated. Calculating coordinates.
BLACK: You will come with us.
DOCTOR: This way.
DOCTOR: The main staging area must be in that warehouse.
ACE: Are we going to have a look?
DOCTOR: Might as well.
MIKE: I've checked the whole building, sir. There's no sign of Ace or the Doctor.
GILMORE: Right, deploy lookouts, take a squad and sweep the area. I want the Doctor found and brought back here.
MIKE: Yes, sir. Okay, men, follow me.
GILMORE: You two, follow me.
DOCTOR: Daleks.
DOCTOR: Be quiet.
ACE: Is that it?
DOCTOR: The Hand of Omega's inside this box. The most powerful and sophisticated remote stellar control manipulator device ever constructed.
ACE: Are you sure you want the Daleks to have it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You know what you've got to do, don't you?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course you do.
ACE: Is it alive?
DOCTOR: In a manner of speaking, yes.
ACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: Some kind of biomechanoid control system, for a small human. Of course, it's a battle computer!
ACE: But why would a human need to sit in it?
DOCTOR: The Dalek's major drawback is their dependency on rationality and logic. The solution? Get a human, preferably young, imaginative, plug the child into the system, and their ingenuity and creativity are slaved to the battle computer.
ACE: That's well boggling.
DOCTOR: It's obscene. Ah, now for the time controller.
ACE: Hey, is this it?
ACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's a device the renegade Daleks use to travel through time. They've come a long way.
ACE: Have you busted it?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I don't want to lumber Earth with a load of desperate Daleks. I've merely put it out of phase. They'll be able to fix it, but it'll slow them down.
RATCLIFFE : What are you going to do to me?
BLACK : Remain silent.
GIRL: The time controller has been disabled!
BLACK: Instruct all Daleks to seek and destroy the intruder.
BLACK: Exterminate the Doctor! Crush all resistance!
GIRL: I obey.
ACE: Why didn't you just run off with the Hand of Omega and give it to the other Daleks?
DOCTOR: With a bit of luck, the Imperial Daleks will wipe out the renegade faction. Besides, I can't just roll up and give it to them. They get suspicious.
ACE: Suspicious of what? You still haven't told me w
DOCTOR: Shush!
MIKE: All right, follow me and keep your eyes peeled for Ace and the Doctor. Move.
ACE: Hey, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: Couldn't we just get in
DOCTOR: No, no, no, we've got work to do. Anyway, here come the military.
MIKE: Where've you been?
DOCTOR: Dalek hunting. Now it's the other way around. Is Gilmore back at the school?
MIKE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good. We'll go back and smooth his troubled brow.
MIKE: Ace, when we're finished with this lot, do you fancy going to the pictures?
ACE: You're confident. Why, what's on?
MIKE: I don't know.
ACE: Doesn't matter. I've probably seen it on television anyway.
MIKE: Huh? Daleks! Move it!
GILMORE: Well, Doctor, I trust your little jaunt was successful.
DOCTOR: Moderately so. I'm afraid we've brought back some Daleks with us.
MIKE: I don't get it. They've got the Hand of Omega. Why don't they just leave?
DOCTOR: How did you know that, Sergeant?
MIKE: Ace told me.
ACE: You toe rag. You lying dirty scumbag.
DOCTOR: It can wait.
ACE: You're finished. He's a grass, a dirty stinking grass! He's selling us out to the Daleks!
GILMORE: What's going on, Sergeant? What are they talking about?
MIKE: I didn't know it was the Daleks, sir.
COMPUTER: Imperial Dalek shuttlecraft entering atmosphere.
BLACK: We must defend the Hand of Omega. Withdraw all units. Return to base immediately.
COMPUTER: I obey.
COMPUTER : Battle computer to all units. Withdraw immediately.
DALEK: Return to base.
ACE: They're retreating, all of them. Wimps!
RACHEL: Doctor, we've had a report of a radar contact.
DOCTOR: On a re-entry curve from low orbit?
RACHEL: Yes.
DOCTOR: That'll be the Imperial Dalek shuttlecraft.
GILMORE: What? They're not landing a spaceship here.
DOCTOR: Here? No. We're much too far from the main action.
RACHEL: You're sure?
ACE: Cor!
DOCTOR: Ace, get away from the window! Down!
DOCTOR: I think I might have miscalculated.
Part Four
DALEK: Advance. We must capture the Hand of Omega from renegade Dalek faction. Proceed to area two five zero six immediately.
GILMORE: Right, out of here. Everybody downstairs.
GILMORE: Is that the mothership?
DOCTOR: No, that's a shuttle. The mothership's much larger. Are you willing to cooperate with me now?
GILMORE: Do I have a choice?
DOCTOR: Well, you could go down there and make a gloriously futile gesture, yes.
GILMORE: What do we do?
DOCTOR: A little bit of piracy.
MIKE: Ace.
ACE: Go away.
MIKE: Ace, I didn't know it was the Daleks. I was just doing Mister Ratcliffe a favour.
ACE: Do me a favour and drown yourself.
MIKE: I thought it was the right thing. Mister Ratcliffe had such great plans. Ace, I never really wanted to hurt anybody. It's just you have to protect your own, keep the outsiders out just that your own people can have a fair chance.
ACE: I said shut up! You've betrayed the Doctor, you betrayed me. I trusted you. I even liked you, and all you
GILMORE: Sergeant Smith.
MIKE: Sir.
GILMORE: Attention! I'm placing you under close arrest under suspicion of offences contrary to the Official Secrets Act.
MIKE: Yes, sir.
DALEK: Scout seven reporting area two five zero nine clear.
DALEK: Retreat! Squad Delta under attack from renegade Daleks. Retreat!
DALEK: Mothership bridge to shuttle force controller. Receiving your signal.
EMPEROR: We must recover the Hand of Omega without delay.
DALEK: Shuttle force has encountered heavy resistance from renegade Daleks.
EMPEROR: Order Special Weapons Dalek into position.
ALLISON: Why are we doing this?
DOCTOR: Elementary piracy, my dear Allison. Dalek shuttles have massive ground defences and an unguarded service hatch on top. Now once I'm down there, I'll attempt to open that hatch. Ace, you come after, then Gilmore, followed by Allison and Rachel. Any questions? No? Good.
DALEK: Emergency! Emergency! Unable to disengage from control position.
DALEK: Humans on the bridge.
DOCTOR: I'm not human.
DALEK: You are the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DALEK: You are the enemy of the Daleks.
DOCTOR: Correct.
DALEK: You must be exterminat
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You can come down now!
CORPORAL: Tea?
MIKE: Yeah.
CORPORAL: Come on, Sarge.
ACE: What did you do to it?
DOCTOR: I shorted it out. Daleks are such boring conversationalists.
RACHEL: It's very functional.
DOCTOR: Yes, they're not known for their aesthetic sense. Let's see what they were up to.
DOCTOR: Ah, the planet Skaro. So, the Daleks are returning to their ancestral seat. I think we've seen enough. Time to leave. Er, get off the grill.
DOCTOR: We'll go back through the playground.
ALLISON: What about the massive ground defences?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've turned those off. Come on, jump.
DALEK: Exterminate.
DALEK 2: Exterminate.
MIKE: No, no, don't. Look, I have a message for Ratcliffe. Understand? A message for Mister Ratcliffe.
DALEK: You are my prisoner. You will obey all instructions or you will be exterminated.
MIKE: You said it, mate.
DOCTOR: I rigged the communications relay to the shuttle control system. We can monitor the Daleks on the transmat in the cellar.
ACE: You can't do that. You mashed up the transmat, remember?
DOCTOR: I can do anything I like!
BLACK: Kneel!
GIRL: Repairs on time controller almost complete.
BLACK: Good.
RATCLIFFE:  Without that thing, they're stuck here. Someone in possession of that would have something to bargain with.
MIKE: For what, our lives?
RATCLIFFE: Nothing so mundane. If we get that, we can demand anything.
MIKE: You never give up, do you.
ALLISON: What happened?
CORPORAL: Sergeant Smith.
RACHEL: Is he all right?
ALLISON: I've no idea, I'm a physicist.
DOCTOR: He'll be fine. Rachel and Allison, I need your help.
RACHEL: Sorry?
ALLISON: He said he needed our help.
RACHEL: That's what I thought he said. Get your hands off his scalp and come on.
GILMORE: You all right, Corporal?
CORPORAL: Sir.
GILMORE: Come with me. We'll search the building.
GIRL: Time controller repaired and ready.
GIRL: Departure imminent.
BLACK: Destroy human captives.
MIKE: No!
RATCLIFFE: No!
RATCLIFFE: Now! Run!
BLACK: Recover the time controller.
RACHEL: When he said he needed our help, I had hoped it meant more in a technical area.
ALLISON: It was a vain hope.
DOCTOR: Ah, you brought it then. Put it down there.
RACHEL: Now, Doctor, will you please answer one question?
DOCTOR: Yes?
RACHEL: Why are two Dalek factions fighting each other.
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: It's simple, isn't it. Renegade Daleks are blobs.
DOCTOR: Blobs?
ACE: Imperial Daleks are bionic blobs with bits added. You can tell that Daleks are into racial purity. So, one lot of Daleks reckon the other lot of blobs are too different. They're mutants. Not pure in their blobbiness.
DOCTOR: Result?
ACE: They hate each other's chromosomes. War to the death.
DOCTOR: Well, er, Ace, let's go and see which blobs are winning.
ALLISON: Doctor, how do you do that?
DOCTOR: Do what?
ALLISON: How do you just rewire a piece of alien machinery?
DOCTOR: It's easy when you have nine hundred years experience.
DALEK: Force leader has recovered the Hand of Omega.
EMPEROR: Excellent. Order all forces to make immediate withdrawal.
ACE: It's Mike.
DOCTOR: He's got the time controller. Typical human. You can always count on them to mess things up. Get after him. Stay with him. See where he's going.
ACE: Right.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: No heroics. I've got enough problems already.
ACE: Trust me.
EMPEROR: Prepare to place the Hand of Omega into the control circuit.
DALEK: I obey.
ALLISON: What are you going to do after all this is over?
RACHEL: Retire to Cambridge and write my memoirs.
GILMORE : Professor!
RACHEL: Subject to security vetting, of course.
GILMORE: The shuttle seems to be leaving.
ALLISON: Good riddance to bad rubbish.
ACE: Oh, wicked.
GILMORE: Well, Doctor, are we out of the woods?
DOCTOR: Provided everything goes according to my plan.
RACHEL: Plan?
ALLISON: I, er, I don't suppose you could let us know what your plan is?
DOCTOR: It's a surprise.
RACHEL: Good. I love surprises.
DALEK: Prepare for shuttle docking.
EMPEROR: Lock the Hand of Omega into the control circuit.
DALEK: Omega device is now locked in and running.
DOCTOR: How do I look? Don't answer. Do you mind? You're in my shot.
DOCTOR: Hello, hello, hello? Dalek mothership, come in please. Come in, please.
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are. This is the Doctor, President Elect of the High Council of Time Lords, Keeper of the legacy of Rassilon, Defender of the Laws of Time, Protector of Gallifrey. I call upon you to surrender the Hand of Omega and return to your customary time and place.
EMPEROR: Ah, Doctor. You have changed again. Your appearance is as inconstant as your intelligence. You have confounded me for the last time!
DOCTOR : Davros. I should have known. I see you've discarded the last vestige of your human form. Still no improvement.
DAVROS: Save your insults for the weak-minded, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Will you return the Hand of Omega or not?
DAVROS: Are you threatening me? If so, it is most unwise.
DOCTOR : Every time our paths have crossed, I have defeated you.
DAVROS: You flatter yourself, Doctor. In the end, you are merely another Time Lord.
DOCTOR: Oh, Davros, I am far more than just another Time Lord.
MIKE: Hello, Ace.
ACE: Would you really shoot me?
MIKE: If I had to.
ACE: You might have to.
DOCTOR : Davros, the Hand of Omega is not to be trifled with.
DAVROS: I think I am quite capable of handling the technology.
DOCTOR : I sincerely doubt that.
DAVROS: Does it worry you, Doctor, that with it I will transform Skaro's sun into a source of unimaginable power? And with that power at my disposal, the Daleks shall sweep away Gallifrey and its impotent quorum of Time Lords!
DAVROS : The Daleks shall become Lords of Time! We shall become all
DOCTOR: Powerful. Crush the lesser races. Conquer the galaxy. Unimaginable power. Unlimited rice pudding, et cetera, et cetera.
DAVROS : Do not anger me, Doctor. I can destroy you and this miserable, insignificant planet.
DOCTOR: Oh, wonderful. What power, what brilliance. You can wipe out the odd civilisation, enslave the occasional culture, but it still won't detract from the basic fundamental truth of your own impotence!
RACHEL: Careful, Doctor.
DOCTOR:  Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
DAVROS: I will teach you the folly of your words, Doctor. I will destroy you and demonstrate the power of the Daleks!
DOCTOR : Davros, I beg of you, don't use the Hand.
DAVROS: Ah, Doctor, now you begin to fear.
DOCTOR : You're making a grave mistake.
DAVROS: Activate the Omega device!
DALEK: Omega device activated.
DALEK 2: Plotting course to home planet Skaro.
DAVROS: Now the Daleks shall become the Lords of Time!
DALEK 2: Entering Skaro time zone. First stage expansion. Primary neutrino release.
DALEK: Core collapse instigated.
DALEK 2: Danger! Instability! Reaction out of control.
DAVROS: No, this cannot be correct!
DALEK: Home planet Skaro about to vapourise.
DAVROS: You have tricked me!
DOCTOR : No, Davros. You tricked yourself.
DALEK 2: Omega device returning.
DALEK: Impact minus twenty five.
DOCTOR : Do you think I would let you have control of the Hand of Omega?
DAVROS: Do not do this, I beg of you.
DOCTOR : Nothing can stop it now.
DAVROS: Have pity on me.
DOCTOR : I have pity for you.
DALEK: Fifteen.
DOCTOR : Goodbye, Davros. It hasn't been pleasant.
DALEK: Emperor abandoning bridge.
DALEK 2: Eight, seven
DALEK: Emperor activating escape pod.
DALEK 2: Four, three
DALEK: Escape pod leaving mothership.
DALEK 2: Two, one.
RACHEL: What happened?
DOCTOR: I programmed the Hand of Omega to fly into Skaro's sun and turn it supernova.
GILMORE: Super what?
ALLISON: He blew it up.
DOCTOR: The resulting explosion destroyed Skaro, and the feedback destroyed the mothership. The Hand of Omega is now returning to Gallifrey.
MIKE: You stay there.
ACE: It might be the Doctor. Put the gun down, Mike. It's too late for that. Come on, Mike, who are you going to shoot with it, anyway?
MIKE: Just stay there.
GILMORE: This is the last Dalek left. I'll call for reinforcements.
DOCTOR: Not this time. I started this.
The Doctor gets out of the van as the little girl enters the front room and smiles at Ace. He walks down the street towards the Dalek.)
DOCTOR: Dalek, you have been defeated. Surrender. You have failed.
BLACK: Insufficient data.
DOCTOR: Your forces are destroyed. Your home planet a burnt cinder circling a dead sun.
BLACK: There is no data.
DOCTOR: Even Davros, your creator, is dead.
DOCTOR: You have no superiors, no inferiors, no reinforcement, no hope, no rescue.
BLACK: You are lying. There is insufficient data.
DOCTOR: You're trapped a trillion miles and a thousand years from a disintegrated home.
BLACK: Out of control!
DOCTOR: I have defeated you. You no longer serve any purpose.
BLACK: Cannot compute. Unstable.
BLACK: Unstable.
ACE: It's all right. Don't worry. It's all over now.
DOCTOR: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
DOCTOR: Time to leave.
ACE: Yes. Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: We did good, didn't we?
DOCTOR: Perhaps. Time will tell. It always does.
