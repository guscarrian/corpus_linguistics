The Curse of Fenric
Part One
PROZOROV:  Captain, we've lost the others.
SORIN: Don't worry. Keep rowing.
DOCTOR: Ah, this looks about right. World War Two uniforms. No need to worry about looking silly.
ACE: If this is a top secret naval camp, then I'm Lord Nelson.
DOCTOR: Oh, whine, whine, whine, whine.
ACE: Professor, top secret naval camps usually have men with guns all over the place. You don't just stroll in.
LEIGH: House guests leaving the conservatory, entering the library.
LEIGH : They'll reach the drawing room in about sixty seconds.
SORIN:  Set up camp over there. Move it. Take the boat up.
PETROSSIAN: What's happened to our comrades?
SORIN: Nothing, nothing. Go on, move on.
ACE: I've had more trouble getting into Greenford disco without a ticket.
DOCTOR: You can always go back.
ACE: I'd rather go rock climbing.
DOCTOR: Not in those clothes.
LEIGH: House guests leaving the nursery. Wait! Something's wrong. One of them's a girl.
BATES: Say again, lookout?
LEIGH : One of them's a girl. They're the wrong ones!
BATES: Rat trap! Rat trap now!
LEIGH: Don't move! Hand's up!
DOCTOR: About time too! Call yourselves Royal Marines? You're a disgrace. Those boots are filthy. What would happen if the Germans attacked now?
PERKINS: Sorry, sir.
ACE: In fact, how do you know we aren't Germans? Well, answer me.
PERKINS: You don't look like Germans, ma'am.
DOCTOR: I don't suppose you know where Doctor Judson's office is? Never mind. This way.
ACE: Yes, sir.
SORIN: Prozorov, everything in English. From now on, everything in English.
PROZOROV: Quick, down on the beach.
SORIN: Come on!
PETROSSIAN: How long till nightfall?
SORIN: Long enough. Come on!
SORIN: Gayev, listen to me. Where are the sealed orders? You had them. Gayev, what's happened to them? Gayev! Let's take him to the camp. Move out! Move, move, move!
JUDSON: What in heaven's name!
DOCTOR: You must be Doctor Judson. Excuse the interruption. I've travelled a long way to meet you.
JUDSON: This is intolerable!
CRANE: A little less excitement please, Doctor Judson. Remember your blood pressure.
DOCTOR: The Prisoner's Dilemma.
CRANE: You can't just stroll in
JUDSON: Oh, shut up, Crane. You're familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma, then?
DOCTOR: Based on a false premise, don't you think, like all zero sum games, but a neat algorithm nevertheless, Doctor Judson. Excuse me, do you have any official stationery and a typewriter I could use?
JUDSON: On the desk.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
JUDSON: You're obviously also an expert in this field, but I'm afraid I don't recognise
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: Hi, I'm Ace and this is the Professor.
DOCTOR: Doctor.
ACE: Sorry, Doctor. Oh, wow! Have you seen this, Professor?
JUDSON: Put it down, child. It's not a toy.
ACE: I know it's not. It's a flip-flop thingy. We used them at school.
JUDSON: You understand it?
ACE: Yeah, it's a logic game, isn't it? You drop marbles in the top, and depending on what colour each window is, the marble follows a different path. You've got a logic diagram for it on the blackboard.
JUDSON: This is extraordinary! And you learnt about logic at school?
ACE: Mmm, Miss Birkett taught us in computer studies. She was well good. Can I borrow this?
DOCTOR: Two pens, please.
JUDSON: Crane!
DOCTOR: Ah, thank you.
DOCTOR: There we are. Come in.
BATES: I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but these two are unauthorised personnel.
DOCTOR: Unauthorised? We are here by urgent request of the War Office. I think you'll find this is signed by the Prime Minister and the head of the Secret Service.
BATES: I must apologise, sir. We weren't informed of your arrival.
DOCTOR: Need to know, Captain, need to know. Doctor Judson's work at trying to break the German codes is very important to the war effort.
BATES:  We thought you were something to do with those East End kids. Evacuees.
ACE: I'm not from the East End, I'm from
JUDSON: Perhaps you'd like to see the Ultima machine?
DOCTOR: The Ultima machine? Yes.
JUDSON: Ah, Bates, go and fetch Commander Millington, will you?
BATES: Sir.
DOCTOR: Commander? Well, on second thoughts, it's been a tiring day. Perhaps tomorrow, Doctor Judson. If you'll just show us to our quarters, we'd be grateful. Thank you.
SORIN: Now, as soon as it's dark, we check the base. Petrossian, you check the shoreline in case anything gets washed up.
PETROSSIAN: Alone?
SORIN: It only needs one.
PETROSSIAN: Will you listen to me? There's evil here. Can't you feel it cold against your skin.
SORIN: Stop it! More stupid Armenian superstitions. You're supposed to be a soldier.
PETROSSIAN: So was he.
SORIN: You follow orders.
ACE: Ace! Bunk beds! Bags I go on top.
DOCTOR: Quiet, Ace. People are trying to sleep.
ACE: Sorry.
ACE: Is it all right if I go down to the cliffs tomorrow and do some rock climbing?
DOCTOR: Go to sleep.
ACE: Sorry.
ACE: Night. Where are you off to?
DOCTOR: Night air. Go to sleep.
PERKINS: Oh, it's you, sir. Thank goodness. I thought
DOCTOR: Eyes. Eyes watching.
WAINWRIGHT: Thank you so much. What a lovely day. Miss Hardaker.
HARDAKER: Your sermon, Mister Wainwright.
WAINWRIGHT: Yes?
HARDAKER: There's no doubt about it, Mister Wainwright, of course we'll win the war. Right is on our side.
WAINWRIGHT: I don't think that right is on anyone's side in war, Miss Hardaker.
HARDAKER: Your father would turn in his grave to hear such words. When he was vicar of this parish, there was respect for the Good Book.
WAINWRIGHT: I think that faith is more than just words.
HARDAKER: In plain language, doubt and indecision.
WAINWRIGHT: Miss Hardaker
DOCTOR: Pardon me. I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Doctor Judson.
WAINWRIGHT: Oh, I think you'll find him still working in the crypt. If you'd like to follow me. Er, good day, Miss Hardaker. This way.
ACE: Who's the old gargoyle? Friend of yours?
JEAN: She's the old bag we've been billeted with.
ACE: Come again?
JEAN: We've been evacuated.
PHYLLIS: We're from London.
ACE: Oh, so am I.
HARDAKER : Come along, girls. Time we were moving.
ACE: Okay, see you later.
PHYLLIS: Where?
ACE: What about over there?
PHYLLIS: Maidens Point. Oh, well, that rules me and Jean out for a start. See you.
ACE: See you, girls. Bye.
BATES: I'm sorry, sir.
 
WAINWRIGHT: I can't see why he spends so much time studying old carvings. I keep telling him he's wasting his time.
DOCTOR: Answering questions is never a waste of time.
WAINWRIGHT: Surely that depends on the answers. When I was studying at Saint Andrew's
DOCTOR: Nietzsche says
ACE: We're not going to be long, are we, Professor? Only I've arranged to meet Phyllis and Jean later.
WAINWRIGHT: If you'll just follow me.
DOCTOR: I was having a good conversation.
ACE: Hey, Vicar.
WAINWRIGHT: Yes?
ACE: You shouldn't leave all this silverware lying around. You're wide open.
WAINWRIGHT: They're suspicious people in these parts. Too afraid of the old Viking curse to break in here.
ACE: Curse?
WAINWRIGHT: This church is built on old Viking graves. They say evil was once buried here.
WAINWRIGHT: Here we are, Doctor. This is the crypt.
JUDSON: Ah, Doctor. What do you make of these, then, hmm?
DOCTOR: Fascinating. Ace, look at this.
ACE: They look like Viking carvings.
DOCTOR: Viking rune stones. Ninth century, yes?
JUDSON: Ah, you evidently know more than I do. 
DOCTOR: Well, it's the alphabet. The later Vikings used a sixteen character alphabet.
JUDSON: Don't tell me. The Ultima machine can break the most sophisticated Nazi ciphers. Some ninth century scribbling shouldn't be much of a problem.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ACE: What's that noise?
DOCTOR: What noise?
ACE: Like a machine.
DOCTOR: Organ bellows. Come on, let's leave Doctor Judson to his puzzles.
ACE: Yeah, okay.
ACE: Yeah, it was definitely some kind of machinery, Professor. Only don't bother listening to me, 'cause I'm only a mere mortal.
DOCTOR: Look.
ACE: Yeah, graves.
DOCTOR: No, at the ground.
ACE: There's a slight dip in it.
DOCTOR: Subsidence. And since the grave was dug.
ACE: How do you know that?
DOCTOR: Well, either that, or they'd been at the communion wine when they'd put up the headstone. Joseph Sundvik. He must be one of the descendants of the original Viking settlers.
ACE: Look at the last one. She only lived thirteen days, poor little thing.  You don't suppose it was that Viking curse, do you?
DOCTOR: Where did you say you were meeting your two friends?
ACE: Somewhere called Maidens Point.
DOCTOR: I think I'll go with you.
HARDAKER: Maidens Point! Did you say Maidens Point?
PHYLLIS: I only want to go for a walk. Maybe have a swim.
HARDAKER: I know what girls who go to Maidens Point have in mind. You will never go near the place, neither of you.
JEAN: All right. Keep your hair on.
HARDAKER: You impudent child. Do you know why it's called Maidens Point? Because when you stand on those cliffs, you can hear the terrible lost cries of girls who went to that place with evil in their hearts. Girls who are damned forever. Yes, you mark my words. There's evil at Maidens Point.
ACE: I like watching the sea. It makes me feel so small. Oh, you'd think people would take their rubbish home with them, wouldn't you?
DOCTOR: What's that?
ACE: People come here for picnics and then leave their rubbish behind.
DOCTOR: It's not the kind of place people come for picnics.
DOCTOR: Not ordinary tourists. Not English, anyway.
ACE: Germans? German spies? 
DOCTOR: Look at the lettering.
ACE: Greek?
DOCTOR: Russian.
ACE: But the Russians were on our side during the war. We'd better warn them at the camp.
DOCTOR: I think they already know.
ACE: Where do you suppose the Russians are now?
DOCTOR: More to the point, where have they come from? From the north, like Vikings. I think I'd better go back to the church.
ACE: Church?
DOCTOR: Well, if you find churches boring, you can stay here, but don't go into the water.
JUDSON: The North Atlantic U-boats have changed ciphers again. That's twice this month.
MILLINGTON: Can we crack them?
JUDSON: Hmm. It may take a few days longer. Oh, they're using six rotors now instead of five.
MILLINGTON: Get inside the Nazi mind, Judson. Learn to think the way they think. It's the only way to understand their ciphers.
JUDSON: The machine can do it, if you'd be so kind as to authorise it, sir. Thank you. Oh yes, the machine can do it. This is the first. In the future there'll be many more computing machines, thinking machines.
MILLINGTON: Yes, but whose thoughts will they think?
JEAN: Come on, Phylly, don't be such a baby doll. You'll love it. It makes you feel all funny inside.
PHYLLIS: All right, but get ready to catch me.
JEAN: All right. Come on.
ACE: Get a move on, we'll be here all day. Here, I'll catch you. Argh, not that quick!
JEAN: You all right?
ACE: Want to do it again?
PHYLLIS: No!
JEAN: Oh, come on Philly, don't be such a baby doll. You should hear what they call her at school.
PHYLLIS: Jean!
JEAN: Doesn't your uncle mind you coming down here by yourself?
ACE: Who? Oh, the Professor. No, he's all right really.
PHYLLIS: That witch said we oughtn't to come here.
PHYLLIS + JEAN: There's evil in the water!
JEAN: Come on. Come swimming. Come for a swim.
PHYLLIS: All right.
ACE: Oi, wait for me!
WAINWRIGHT: I beg your pardon. I didn't hear you.
DOCTOR: Possibly not.
WAINWRIGHT: What can I do for you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'd like to know the answer.
WAINWRIGHT: I'm afraid I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Afraid, yes, but of what? The Viking inscriptions? The curse?
WAINWRIGHT: Doctor, there are some questions better left unanswered.
DOCTOR: That may be so, but it's too late, isn't it? Someone's already translated the inscriptions.
WAINWRIGHT: It's probably all nonsense. Some records that my grandfather made when he was vicar of Saint Jude's at the end of the last century. He translated the Viking inscriptions. I wish to heavens he never had.
JEAN: Come on! Don't be such a baby doll.
ACE: No, swimming's stupid.
PHYLLIS: It's lovely and warm.
ACE: Anyway, it's dangerous. Look.
JEAN: Oh, you're just a baby doll.
ACE: Stupid.
DOCTOR:  We hope to return to the North Way, carrying home the oriental treasures from the Silk Lands in the east, but the dark curse follows our dragon ship.
DOCTOR : Black fog turned day into night, and the fingers of death reached out from the waters to reclaim the treasure we have stolen.
DOCTOR : I carve these stones in memory of Asmund, Grimvald, Torkal, Halfdan, brave Viking warriors slain by the curse.
DOCTOR: We sought haven in Northumbria, and took refuge at a place called Maidens' Bay, but the curse of the treasure has followed us to this place. Maidens Bay?
WAINWRIGHT: That's Maidens Point.
DOCTOR: But I've just left Ace there.
ACE: Yep, but I'm here now, aren't I? What've you got there Professor?
DOCTOR: It's a translation of the Viking inscriptions. Look. And there's something I've just noticed.
ACE: What's that?
DOCTOR: Look. We hope to return to the North Way, carrying home the oriental treasure. Now, listen to this.
DOCTOR: Vozravschayetes ve Norwegious sakrovisichem.
ACE: I only did French O level.
DOCTOR: We return to Norway, the North Way, bearing the treasure. Now, let's see how Doctor Judson is getting along, shall we?
PHYLLIS: Hold still, will you?
JEAN: Make me look like Lana Turner.
PHYLLIS: You mean Betty Grable.
BOTH: Jane Russell!
JEAN: Here, look at that.
PHYLLIS: What is it?
JEAN: Ooo, it feels all funny and tingly. Here.
PHYLLIS: Oh! It's like electric.
PHYLLIS: No, leave it. I don't like it.
JEAN: It's just a piece of junk. Come on, we'd better get going before that old bag starts wailing.
PROZOROV: No closer, please.
JEAN + PHYLLIS: Alice Faye!
.DOCTOR: Doctor Judson? Something here that might interest you.
JUDSON: What's that then?
DOCTOR: A nineteenth century translation of the Viking inscriptions, courtesy of Mister Wainwright's grandfather.
JUDSON: Really?  Night is the time of the evil curse, and no man is safe alone. This is invaluable! The waters are most dangerous.
JUDSON : The dark evil lies waiting in the sea. It has followed the treasure we stole.
JUDSON : We cannot see it, but we know it is there, beneath the surface, beyond seeing, but it is there.
JUDSON : And one by one, our crew is being killed.
ACE: I didn't know they had personal stereos in 1943.
DOCTOR: They're listening to coded German radio messages.
ACE: Oh.
KATHLEEN: Are you looking for someone?
DOCTOR: Ah, er, we're just being nosy.
KATHLEEN: Well, we're the girls, and I'm Kathleen.
DOCTOR: Kathleen.
KATHLEEN: Hello.
DOCTOR: Hello.
ACE: Oh, look, Professor. A baby.
ACE: Is it yours?
KATHLEEN: Yes, and she's a she.
ACE: She's lovely. Can I pick her up?
DOCTOR: You've got to excuse her. She's from Perivale.
KATHLEEN: That's all right. Of course you can.
ACE: Thanks.
KATHLEEN: Where's Perivale?
ACE: You don't want to know. Oh, now what do I do?
KATHLEEN: Just put your arm underneath her like that.
ACE: Yeah.
KATHLEEN: Get her head, and you're fine. You're fine. There we are.
ACE: Oh, Professor, isn't she beautiful? Oh, look at her little finger nails. They're so perfect, and so tiny.
DOCTOR: Yes. Every one a heart breaker.
ACE: What's she called?
KATHLEEN: Audrey.
KATHLEEN: What's the matter? Don't you like it?
ACE: I hate it. That's my mum's name. Here.
KATHLEEN: Come here, darling. Audrey.
MILLINGTON: Dudman, I gave you clear instructions the baby was not to remain on camp.
KATHLEEN: Yes, sir.
MILLINGTON: Well?
KATHLEEN: Well, I thought she could stay with my cousin, sir, only their cottage is too small, and I
MILLINGTON: Twenty four hours, Dudman, or I shall have you dismissed from service.
KATHLEEN: Yes, sir.
ACE:  Who'd you think you are, armpit?
DOCTOR:  Not now, Ace.
ACE: Why didn't you let me sort him out, Professor?
DOCTOR: There are more effective ways. Look.
DOCTOR: Come on.
ACE: Where are we off to?
DOCTOR: I thought we'd have a quick recce in his office.
DOCTOR: Extraordinary!
ACE: What is this?
DOCTOR: This is a perfect replica of the German naval cipher room in Berlin. Even down to the files. Oh, dreadful man.
ACE: Commander Millington's a spy?
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. He's just trying to think the way the Germans think. Keep one step ahead. But he's done it so perfectly. Let's see what else they've got here. Oh dear, look at that. Pictures of cities being bombed, innocent people. Wait a minute. That's not right.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
ACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: The old school tie. It seems that Millington and Judson went to school together. That was before Judson had his accident.
ACE: Why is everyone round here so interested in Vikings?
DOCTOR: Yes, why?
MILLINGTON: A girl? From the War Office?
JUDSON: She's a mathematical specialist. She understands the logic diagrams. And they found an old translation of those Viking inscriptions.
MILLINGTON: Let me see.  I warn of the day when the earth shall fall asunder, and all of heaven too. The Wolves of Fenric shall return for their treasure, and then shall the dark evil rule eternally. This is it. The final battle between the gods and the beasts. It's now, Judson. The Curse of Fenric.
ACE: I'm confused, Professor. I mean, what's it got to do with the Russian papers?
DOCTOR: Well, whatever it is, it'll be down here somewhere, near where we found those papers.
ACE: What are we looking for? I mean, is it big, or is
ACE: Doctor.
DOCTOR: What have you found?
DOCTOR: Yes, not very pleasant. What's he holding?
Part Two
PROZOROV: No! We don't want to attract attention.
DOCTOR: Do you know what's happening here? Do you think we really killed him?
PROZOROV: It doesn't matter. You know too much. You die.
DOCTOR: We know more than you think. Vozravschayetes ve Norwegious sakrovischem.
ACE: Return to Norway with the treasure.
VERSHININ: Kill them, Prozorov.
PROZOROV: No, we take them back to Captain Sorin.
JUDSON:  I am the only one left alive now. I raise these stones to my wife Astrid. May she forgive my sins. The day grows dark, and I sense the evil curse rising from the sea.
JUDSON : I know now what the Curse of Fenric seeks. The treasures from the Silk Lands in the east.
JUDSON : I've heard the treasures whisper in my dreams. I've heard the magic words that will release great powers. I shall bury the treasures for ever. Tonight, I shall die, and the words die with me.
DOCTOR: If, if you attack the camp now, you'll walk straight into a trap. And if you stay here, you'll die just like your comrade.
SORIN: And if I let you go, you betray us.
DOCTOR: It's the only way. It's the only way to destroy the evil that's killing your men.
VERSHININ: His mind's in pieces.
ACE: What's happened to him?
DOCTOR: Whatever killed his comrade, he's seen it.
DOCTOR: What was it? What did you see? Tell us.
VERSHININ: Come on, this is useless.
SORIN: Vershinin.
DOCTOR: Dig down, think back. Maidens Point, the undercurrents. What did you see? Shotividyo?
VERSHININ: He'll never speak again.
DOCTOR: Calm down.
SORIN: We delay our attack until you both return.
VERSHININ: Kapitan, this is madness.
SORIN: We play for high stakes. Victory goes to those who take the greatest risk. Go. 
JUDSON: Why didn't he translate the final inscription? It's always the family idiot that takes the cloth.
CRANE: I don't like it down here.
JUDSON: Then go away.
CRANE: Don't you feel the cold? It's like winter. It's most unsuitable for an invalid.
JUDSON: Oh, shut up, Crane.
CRANE: Oh, come on. Let's have you back in the warm.
JUDSON: You stupid woman.
CRANE: Language, Doctor Judson. There's a lady present.
JEAN: Ooo, I love men in uniform!
PHYLLIS: Don't they look strong?
DOCTOR: Why do I feel there's something different about this place?
ACE: Yeah, it doesn't even look like a church.
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
ACE: Well, from the outside, it looks more like a small fortress.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no! Different since we were last here.
ACE: Oh.
DOCTOR: I think it's about time we had a proper look at those inscriptions.
MILLINGTON: Use the Ultima machine. Use the machine to translate the inscriptions.
JUDSON: But what about the German ciphers?
MILLINGTON: Use it!
ACE: Can you hear noises from behind the walls?
DOCTOR: Can't hear a thing.
ACE: I definitely heard them.
DOCTOR: Ace, come here. Look at that. What do you notice?
ACE: This one's a slightly different alphabet to the rest.
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: And, we, it uses fewer characters.
DOCTOR: And?
ACE: And, that means it's older than all the rest.
DOCTOR: And?
ACE: And er, I don't know.
DOCTOR: And it wasn't here this morning.
ACE: Oh yeah. Hang about, these inscriptions are a thousand years old.
DOCTOR: Quick, hide!
ACE: Where is he?
DOCTOR: Those noises you heard this morning.
ACE: A secret door? Yeah, well, I'm sure the noises came from over this side.
ACE: What happens if we do find something?
DOCTOR: Shush.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Ace!
MILLINGTON: I think this is what you're looking for, Doctor.
WAINWRIGHT: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. When I became a man, I put away childish things. Now abideth faith, hope, love. These three. And the greatest of these is. And the greatest of these is.
SORIN: No shooting.
SORIN: Has anyone seen us?
VERSHININ: It's as quiet as the grave.
SORIN: Let's take them to the camp. Move it, move it.
MILLINGTON: Leave the empty drums. Just take the valuable equipment.
ACE: A laboratory.
MILLINGTON: Behold, the end of the war.
DOCTOR: So, this is what brought you here. A natural source of lethal poisons.
ACE: The Curse of Fenric.
MILLINGTON: Once the Nazis see what our planes are dropping on their cities
ACE: But you can't!
MILLINGTON: It'll mean the end of the war. Save hundreds of thousands of lives.
DOCTOR: More horrible than the Well of Hvergelmir.
MILLINGTON: What did you say?
DOCTOR: The Well of Hvergelmir, deep beneath the ground where broods of serpents spew their venom over the roots of the Great Ash Tree.
MILLINGTON: The Great Ash Tree. The soul of all the Earth.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Shush.
MILLINGTON: We have seen it, Doctor. You and I. We have seen hell. Come, I'll show you it all.
ACE: What's he on about?
DOCTOR: Norse mythology. It seems that I've persuaded him that I'm on his side.
VERSHININ: You should have seen him. With his bare hands. When it comes to killing, the sarge is an expert.
SORIN: Prozorov. These things have to be done.
ACE: Professor.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ACE: What's wrong with the vicar?
MILLINGTON: No girls. Leave her here.
ACE: What? You're beginning to aggravate me.
DOCTOR: Don't antagonise him, Ace. You'd better stay here.
ACE: Professor.
DOCTOR: Only for a short time. I've got to find out what is going on, and you can find out what's wrong with Mister Wainwright.
ACE: All right.
DOCTOR: Coming, Commander.  Give me an hour.
ACE: Funny church, this, isn't it?
WAINWRIGHT: I was just remembering when I was a child. My father was the vicar here then. It seemed such a warm, friendly place in those days.
ACE: Things always look different when you're a child.
WAINWRIGHT: Now I stand in the church every Sunday, I see all the faces looking up at me, waiting for me to give them something to believe in.
ACE: Don't you believe in anything?
WAINWRIGHT: I used to believe there was good in the world, hope for the future.
ACE: The future's not so bad. Have faith in me.
JUDSON: Ah, Millington. I need the central rotor unit unlocking.
DOCTOR: The Ultima machine.
JUDSON: Of course, you haven't seen it, have you? A completely automatic computing machine, the most advanced in the world.
DOCTOR: Remarkable for the nineteen forties.
MILLINGTON: This is just the bait.
DOCTOR: For the Germans?
MILLINGTON: Russians.
DOCTOR: But they're your allies.
MILLINGTON: After the war, when they're no longer allies. This is what the Russians want. The mind of the Ultima machine.
JUDSON: More than a thousand combinations an hour, with automatic negative checking.
MILLINGTON: And we are going to let the Russians steal it. Orders from Whitehall. Look inside, Doctor. Look deep inside.
HARDAKER: You will burn in the everlasting fires of hell! You wicked, evil girls!
PHYLLIS: Just because you've never been swimming.
HARDAKER: You have black hearts! There's no love in heaven or earth for you. Nothing for you but pitiless damnation for the rest of your lives! Think on it.
MILLINGTON: A demonstration, Doctor.
MILLINGTON: This small capsule contains just a few drops of diluted toxin.
DOCTOR: No, don't!
MILLINGTON: Just think what a bomb full could do to a city like Dresden or Moscow.
DOCTOR: It's inhuman.
MILLINGTON: It could mean the end of the war.
DOCTOR: And Whitehall thinks that Moscow is careless enough to let you detonate one of those things inside the Kremlin?
MILLINGTON: Oh, that's the beauty of it, Doctor. We won't detonate it. They'll do it themselves. They'll use the machine to decrypt our ciphers, but Doctor Judson has programmed it to self-destruct when it tries to decrypt a particular word. And, once the political climate is appropriate, we will include the word in one of our ciphers.
DOCTOR: And the word is?
MILLINGTON: What else could it be, Doctor? Love.
SOLDIER 1: What was that?
SOLDIER 1: Is this ours?
SOLDIER 2: Is it marked government property?
SOLDIER 1: No.
SOLDIER 2: Nothing to do with us then. Leave it.
SOLDIER 2: Right, let's get this sealed up.
JEAN: I don't care if I've got nothing to wear!
PHYLLIS: It's so warm and peaceful.
JEAN: Here, Philly. What's that?
PHYLLIS: What is it?
JEAN: It's a sort of mist.
PHYLLIS: So what? Who cares? It's warm in the water.
JEAN: Yeah.
JEAN: Philly!
MILLINGTON: Yes?
BATES: I thought you'd like to know, sir. They've finished closing down operations over at the church.
MILLINGTON: Good. Tell me, they didn't find anything unusual, did they?
BATES: Not to my knowledge, sir.
MILLINGTON: I can't take any more risks. I want all radio transmitters and outside telephone lines disabling.
BATES: That may attract attention, sir.
MILLINGTON: Do it.
BATES: Sir!
MILLINGTON: And if there are any chess sets in the camp, I want them burnt.
BATES: Chess sets?
MILLINGTON: Burnt!
BATES: Sir!
PERKINS: Sorry, girls. Commander's orders. No more chess sets.
DOCTOR: Don't you find the Commander's orders a little peculiar sometimes, soldier?
PERKINS: Peculiar or not, orders is orders. Come on girls, let's have your chess set.
DOCTOR: Ah. What are you going to do with her?
KATHLEEN: Oh, something will turn up. One of the girls has gone to ask her sister if Audrey can stay with her for a few days till I sort something out. Do you have any family yourself?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
KATHLEEN: Oh, I'm sorry. It's the war, isn't it? It must be terrible not knowing.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: You haven't seen Ace at all? I'm getting a little worried.
JUDSON: Quiet! Now, let's see what lies encrypted in these carvings, hmm?
JUDSON:  Let the chains of Fenric shatter. Even with an alphabet more than a thousand years old, the Ultima machine can reveal it's meaning.
DOCTOR: It can translate it, but who knows what it might mean?
CRANE: But who cares?
PHYLLIS: Look.
JEAN: Yes, a man.
JEAN: Are you looking at us?
JEAN: Yes, he's watching us.
PHYLLIS: He's got to come into the water with us.
JEAN: Yes, you've got to come into the water.
PHYLLIS: It's warm.
JEAN: Blood warm. Nobody's forcing him. Nobody ever forces you to come into the water.
PHYLLIS: But everybody wants to. Deep down, everybody wants to come into the water.
JEAN: Come on. Come play with us.
JUDSON: Oh yes, yes, I've known Millington since before my accident.
ACE: Hiya.
DOCTOR: Ah, good. Oh, I need to have a word with your two young friends.
ACE: Jean and Phyllis?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: They'll be with the old dragon.
DOCTOR: Good. Back in a mo. I'm just going to requisition some transport.
ACE: Bags I drive!
JUDSON: Shut up. I said, shut up!
ACE: I know what it is.
JUDSON: I am trying to work.
ACE: I know what the inscription means.
JUDSON: Yes, yes. I already know. Let the chains of Fenric shatter. I already know that.
ACE: No, no, no. It's a logic diagram.
JUDSON: What?
ACE: Look, this is a logic diagram for the flip-flop thingy, right?
ACE: And this is a logic diagram for something else.
JUDSON: But it's so complex.
ACE: That's because it's not for a small thing like this. It's for a computer.
JUDSON: Crane! Take me to the decrypt room!
ACE: And the half-time score, Perivale six hundred million, rest of the universe nil.
HARDAKER: No! No! No, I beg you! No! No! Argh!
DOCTOR: Hello? Anybody home?
ACE: Professor.
DOCTOR: Looks like the one at Maidens Point. Completely drained of blood.
WAINWRIGHT: I know who you are.
PHYLLIS: You've always known us.
WAINWRIGHT: But vampires are just superstition. Why?
JEAN: We have black hearts. We were lost on the day we were born.
WAINWRIGHT: That's not true. No one is lost.
PHYLLIS: Everyone is lost.
WAINWRIGHT: No further. This is holy. It will destroy you.
PHYLLIS: Objects can't harm us. It's human belief, and you stopped believing when the bombs started falling.
WAINWRIGHT: I'm not frightened of German bombs.
JEAN: Not German bombs, British.
PHYLLIS: On German cities. British bombs killing German children.
WAINWRIGHT: No. No!
DOCTOR: Stop!
ACE: What's happened to you? What are you doing?
PHYLLIS: You should have come into the water with us. Then we'd have been together.
DOCTOR: Go! Go!
JEAN: We go, but we'll return for you, Wainwright.
MILLINGTON: This is it, Judson.
CRANE: A little respect for the wheelchair, please, Commander. He's an invalid.
JUDSON: I'm not an invalid, I'm a cripple. I'm also a genius, so shut up, the pair of you.
MILLINGTON: All that remains is the flask. The machine can unlock its secrets.
JUDSON: Now then, Millington. Let's see, shall we?
MILLINGTON: Yes, quick!
WAINWRIGHT: We must tell Commander Millington.
DOCTOR: No, that's exactly what we won't do. He'll just go around shooting everything. No, as long as Doctor Judson doesn't work out what the inscription is, it'll keep them out of harms way. And he's a typical blinkered scientist.
ACE: Oh no! You should have told me. 
DOCTOR: Quick! We'd better stop them!
MILLINGTON: What does it mean?
JUDSON: I don't know.
MILLINGTON: You built the damn machine!
JUDSON: It's running at four times maximum speed. I mean, it's impossible!
DOCTOR: Stop the machine!
MILLINGTON: Get out of here!
DOCTOR: You've got to stop the machine!
JUDSON: I can't!
DOCTOR: Ace, the power!
ACE: It's stuck!
DOCTOR: Pull it! Pull it!
ACE: I can't!
MILLINGTON: You're too late, Doctor!
Part Three
MILLINGTON: Captain, no one is to touch the Ultima machine. It must complete it's task.
BATES: Sir.
DOCTOR: Just one problem. You've weakened the bases' defences precisely so some Russians could steal it.
MILLINGTON: Captain, radio for reinforcements.
BATES: Sir, you've just ordered that all radio transmitters be disabled. I've just set Perkins onto it now.
MILLINGTON: What!
PERKINS: Sir. Radio transmitters disabled, as ordered, sir.
DOCTOR: Splendid work, Perkins. Splendid work. Now put them back together again.
DOCTOR: We haven't got much time.
ACE: But Jean and Phyllis?
WAINWRIGHT: Dark legends. In the story of Dracula, this is where he came ashore.
ACE: Vampires?
DOCTOR: No, not vampires, haemovores. They are what Homo sapiens evolve into thousands of years in the future. Creatures with an insatiable hunger for blood.
WAINWRIGHT: I don't understand. The future? How can you know?
DOCTOR: I've seen it. How good are your parish records?
WAINWRIGHT: Oh, they go back as far as the eighteenth century.
DOCTOR: Good. Now for a little local history.
WAINWRIGHT: Right.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ACE: I was just thinking. If these vampires, I mean haemovores, if they come here. Well, Kathleen and her little baby.
DOCTOR: Look, once upon a time you'd have dropped everything just for a little bit of excitement.
ACE: Yeah, but I just want to make sure they're all right.
DOCTOR: Catch us up.
ACE: Thanks.
WAINWRIGHT: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
WAINWRIGHT: Those two girls. They said they'd come back for me.
DOCTOR: Do you want to stay here? 
WAINWRIGHT: No. No, no I can't. Come, Doctor, the parish records.
VERSHININ: I'm sorry, Kapitan. I know you and the sergeant had been friends a long time. Kapitan. Kapitan!
VERSHININ: On your command.
SORIN: Save your bullets. Everyone pulls back, and don't turn away from them or you're dead. Take him. Come on! Move, move!
ACE: Hiya. How's the little horror?
KATHLEEN:  Well, I've just fed her and put her down.
ACE: Oh, I'm sorry. You should have told me.  Where will you go?
KATHLEEN: Oh, I'll manage. Frank's got shore leave in a few weeks.
ACE: Who's Frank? Your boyfriend?
KATHLEEN: No, my husband.
ACE: Oh, I didn't know you were married.
KATHLEEN: I've got a baby.
ACE: Yeah, I just thought that
KATHLEEN: Well, you can stop thinking it, all right?
ACE: Oh, I, I didn't know.
KATHLEEN: It's okay. It's okay.
ACE: Where is he?
KATHLEEN: He's in the Merchant Navy, Atlantic convoys.
ACE: I used to think I'll never get married, but now I'm not so sure. There's a lot of things I'm not sure about now.
KATHLEEN: It's the war, Ace.
ACE: Yeah. Look, take care, won't you?
KATHLEEN: Thanks, you too.
ACE: No, I mean really take care.
JUDSON: We're wasting our time on some superstition.
MILLINGTON: The Viking legends will come true. The treasure will be brought to us, and with it all the dark powers of Fenric shall be ours.
JUDSON: Oh yes, I know. Let the chains of Fenric shatter. Well, what about my chains?
MILLINGTON: That was over twenty years ago. Why must you remind me? I offer you everything.
VERSHININ: Kapitan, what are they?
SORIN: Six months ago, a small sabotage team was sent into German occupied Romania. Only one survived. He talked about dead men coming out of a black fog. The official report said he'd been listening to too much local gossip about vampires.
VERSHININ: But vampires don't exist.
SORIN: Of course not.
ACE: Why does your bell tower look like a fortress? Like the people who built it were expecting trouble.
WAINWRIGHT: I don't think there's a record of any battles taking place here.
DOCTOR: Today's events haven't been written down yet. Now, you're looking for the descendants of the early Viking settlers about two hundred years ago. Ace, you help me.
ACE: So what exactly are we looking for?
DOCTOR: The Viking inscriptions said they were carrying treasures from the Orient.
ACE: You might give me something to go on. I mean, a few hints might be useful.
DOCTOR: Well, just look for something evil.
WAINWRIGHT [OC: Doctor! Doctor!
WAINWRIGHT: Doctor, I've found it. Exactly as you said.
ACE: What you got, vicar?
WAINWRIGHT: There's your Vikings, or descendants of them at any rate.  Joseph Sundvik, Florence Sundvik, wife. Daughters Sarah, Martha, Jane, Clara, Annie.
DOCTOR: The curse of Fenric, passed down through the generations.
 
DOCTOR: Find out which daughters married, and what their new surnames are.
ACE: Professor, what's this water doing here?
WAINWRIGHT: Oh, it's the roof. It leaks. It always seeps in like that when it's raining and there's an east wind.
DOCTOR: The problem is, it's not raining. There's a west wind.
ACE: Vicar!
SORIN: Follow me!
SORIN: Takes two against one, does it? How about a little Cossack blood, eh?
SORIN: Fire!
SORIN: Up the ladder, quick!
SORIN: Go, quick!
DOCTOR: Hold them! Hold them!
WAINWRIGHT: I don't know that I can!
DOCTOR: You've got to have faith! Have faith. Faith. Faith.
SORIN: We won't have any more trouble from those two. Quick, up the ladder.
DOCTOR: Ah. Any more up there?
SORIN: Only those creatures.
DOCTOR: Quick, you and your men, down to the crypt.
SORIN: Down.
DOCTOR: Get the record books.
WAINWRIGHT: Right.
DOCTOR: Hurry up!
WAINWRIGHT: Yes!
DOCTOR: Jam the door.
ACE: Professor, that noise you were making. Like singing, only it wasn't.
DOCTOR: Ah, just a little something to frighten off haemovores.
ACE: I thought vampires were scared of crucifixes.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's not the crucifix that frightens them, it's the faith of the person carrying it. It creates a psychic barrier, just like I did.
SORIN: Door's secure.
WAINWRIGHT: We're trapped.
DOCTOR: Ace?
ACE: The mine shaft.
DOCTOR: Correct. 
SORIN: Listen, I must go back to my men.
WAINWRIGHT: You can't go back that way. Those creatures, they're, they're inhuman.
SORIN: I must try. If I fail, I fail. These two will stay with you.
ACE: Professor, show him how to make the singing.
DOCTOR: I can't. Either he believes absolutely, or he doesn't.
SORIN: I believe in the Revolution.
DOCTOR: Complete faith? No doubts?
SORIN: Go. If we meet again, you will have your answer. Go.
SORIN: Be careful.
DOCTOR: I hope we're not too late.
DOCTOR: Oh no!
WAINWRIGHT: What's happened?
DOCTOR: You two, break that wall down. Quick, quick!
ACE: If you want a job doing properly, get a girl to do it. Out of the way, boys.
DOCTOR: Ace! Oh, don't antagonise her. It'll only make things worse.
ACE: Five seconds and you're yesterday's breakfast, sunbeam.
DOCTOR: Take cover!
ACE: Wicked.
DOCTOR: Quick, get in the tunnel!  I'll talk to you later.
ACE: How much further?
DOCTOR: Three or four hundred metres.
ACE: Oh, we'll never make it.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ACE: Well, if I get the top off this, then I can make up some more nitro.
DOCTOR: Another explosion might bring the roof down on top of our heads.
ACE: Oh, just a small one?
DOCTOR: No! 
WAINWRIGHT: If only we could slow them down for a few moments.
DOCTOR: Two minutes, then follow us.
DOCTOR: Where did you find that?
ACE: It was just lying around.
DOCTOR: That's the Oriental treasure we've been looking for.
ACE: Oh.
VERSHININ: What's happening? The air, it's so still and so warm.
SORIN: There is a storm coming on.
MILLINGTON : Come on! You're almost here.
MILLINGTON: Right, seal it.
DOCTOR: But there are two people following us.
MILLINGTON: You're here, that's all I'm interested in. And I'll have those.
DOCTOR: Open those doors!
MILLINGTON: Many years ago, when I was Chief Petty Officer on board ship, we had an explosion in an engine room.
DOCTOR: But the Russians are our friends, our allies!
MILLINGTON: I had to seal it off to save the ship, keep the flames restricted to one section.
WAINWRIGHT: Please, Commander. Those two men won't stand a chance against those creatures. They're inhuman!
ACE: So's he.
MILLINGTON: We could hear men screaming behind the bulkheads for nearly an hour, and then the screaming stopped.
WAINWRIGHT: But, but
SORIN: Okay. You stay here. If I'm not back in ten minutes, abort the mission. Take this.
VERSHININ: Take cover.
SORIN: Commander Millington! Commander Millington, I want to talk with you, officer to officer!
MILLINGTON: Here we are, Judson. I said it would be brought to us. Release the power.
BATES: Sir, the house guests have arrived.
MILLINGTON: What?
BATES: The house guests. There's one outside. He wants to talk to you.
MILLINGTON: Talk?
SORIN: We must talk, Commander Millington.
MILLINGTON: I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage. You seem to know my name, but I don't know yours.
MILLINGTON: However, that hardly seems to matter at the moment. You will tell your men to put down their weapons and surrender.
SORIN: I come alone. Very well.  Lay down your weapons and come in peacefully, like the wolves of winter.
VERSHININ: Move! Move back! Move it! Let's get out of here!
MILLINGTON: Lock him up.
MILLINGTON: You'll be pleased to know, Doctor, everything is under control.
DOCTOR: The Russians aren't your problem, those creatures are. They devour humans the way you eat fruit.
MILLINGTON: I doubt if any creatures can walk through iron shutters.
DOCTOR: They can weld metal beneath the sea with their bare hands.
ACE: You all right? What is it? What's wrong? Tell me. What's the matter? I'll do anything.
ACE: What's this?  It is with deepest sorrow that I write to inform you that the ship on which your husband, Frank William Dudman, was serving, was struck by enemy torpedoes. Your husband was trapped in the fire and has been listed as missing, presumed dead. Please accept our sincere condolences. I'm sorry.
ACE: You know what's going on, don't you?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: You always know. You just can't be bothered to tell anyone. It's like it's some kind of game, and only you know the rules. You knew all about that inscription being a computer programme, but you didn't tell me. You know all about that old bottle, and you're not telling me. Am I so stupid?
DOCTOR: No, that's not it.
ACE: Why then? I want to know.
DOCTOR: Evil. Evil since the dawn of time.
ACE: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Will you stop asking me these questions?
ACE: Tell me!
DOCTOR: The dawn of time. The beginning of all beginnings. Two forces only, good and evil. Then chaos. Time is born, matter, space. The universe cries out like a newborn. The forces shatter as the universe explodes outwards. Only echoes remain, and yet somehow, somehow the evil force survives. An intelligence. Pure evil!
ACE: That's Fenric?
DOCTOR: No, that's just Millington's name for it. Evil has no name. Trapped inside a flask like a genie in a bottle.
ACE: Can we stop it?
DOCTOR: We need to get that flask.
ACE: We can release Captain Sorin to help us. I can distract the guard.
DOCTOR: How?
ACE: Professor, I'm not a little girl.
LEIGH: Are you looking for someone?
ACE: No. You.
ACE: There's a wind whipping up. I can feel it through my clothes. Is there a storm coming?
LEIGH: I wasn't expecting one.
ACE: The question is, is he making all the right moves or only going through the motions?
LEIGH: What are you doing here?
ACE: You have to move faster than that if you want to keep up with me. Faster than light.
LEIGH: Faster than the second hand on a watch?
ACE: Much faster. We're not even moving yet. Hardly cruising speed. Sometimes I move so fast, I don't exist any more.
LEIGH: What can you see?
ACE : Undercurrents, bringing things to the surface.
ACE: I can't stay.
LEIGH: You promised.
ACE: I can't.
WAINWRIGHT: I'm here.
JEAN: The book won't do you any good. You don't believe.
WAINWRIGHT: We'll see.
DOCTOR: You all right?
ACE: Yeah, nothing out of my depth.
DOCTOR: Come on.
ACE: How are we going to stop Fenric?
DOCTOR: Evil needs a body. It hasn't found one yet.
SORIN: Thank you.
PHYLLIS: It's not true. You don't believe it.
JEAN: Look at us. There's no good in us.
WAINWRIGHT: No! I believe in good.
PHYLLIS: Look in yourself. There's no good in you.
WAINWRIGHT: No! No!
WAINWRIGHT: No! No! No!
JUDSON: What's it doing?
DOCTOR: Don't touch him! Don't touch anything!
CRANE: He's an invalid. He can't even stand without someone to support him.
DOCTOR: He's dead.
MILLINGTON: The time is now. The chains of Fenric are shattered. The gods have lost the final battle.
ACE: We're too late. It's him!
MILLINGTON: The dead men's ship has slipped its moorings, and the Great Ash itself trembles to its roots. Fenric!
JUDSON: We play the contest again, Time Lord.
Part Four
KATHLEEN: When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. Down will come baby, cradle and all.
JUDSON: You left me in the shadow dimensions, trapped for seventeen centuries. But now I've found a body again, and the preparations are complete.
MILLINGTON: Shoot them!
BATES: What for?
MILLINGTON: Because I order you to. For treason.
BATES: Sir.
JUDSON: I was only expecting one.
DOCTOR: You don't have to kill her.
BATES: Let's just get this over with. Ready!
DOCTOR: She's only a child!
BATES: Aim!
SORIN: Killing us doesn't make any difference.
ACE: Mum, I'm sorry!
BATES: Take cover!
DOCTOR: Hurry! Come on!
JUDSON: I was hoping for something a little more, well, Aryan. However, let the Ancient One approach. Where is the Ancient One?
JEAN: He waits.
JUDSON: He waits? He waits? What for? Has he no sense of occasion? I want him here, now.
PHYLLIS: As you command.
DOCTOR: What did you say over there?
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: Over there. You said something.
ACE: Oh, nothing. Just, just something.
DOCTOR: You mentioned your mum.
ACE: Don't play games with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We're all playing games. Fenric's games. We're playing his games and falling into his traps.
MILLINGTON: And the battlefield shall stretch a hundred leagues, and at the end of the day not one living thing shall be left alive. The ancient enemies shall seek each other out, and all shall die!
JUDSON: How English. Everything stops for tea. Fetch me the ancient one. There is much to do.
DOCTOR: I must play the game to the end this time.
ACE: What game?
DOCTOR: A very simple game. A game of chess.
BATES : Move it, move it.!
DOCTOR: I need a chess set to play the game. I need pieces.
ACE: If we can get into Commander Millington's office, we could nick his chess set.
SORIN: Hey, we came here to steal Ultima machine. Chess set? No problem. Follow.
SORIN: We've got a clear path to the British positions. Go.
MILLINGTON: Establish new positions. Secure the laboratory.
BATES: Follow me!
PHYLLIS: You are summoned.
JEAN + PHYLLIS: You must obey.
JUDSON: Ah, the sound of dying. When it comes to death, quantity is so much more satisfying than quality.
MILLINGTON: The final
JUDSON: Don't interrupt me when I'm eulogising. Where is the Time Lord?
MILLINGTON: Time Lord?
JUDSON: The one you call Doctor.
MILLINGTON: I had him shot.
JUDSON: I can see you've never been handicapped by great intelligence. For seventeen centuries I was trapped in the shadow dimensions because of him. He pulled bones from the desert sands and carved them into chess pieces. He challenged me to solve his puzzle. I failed. Now I shall see him kneel before me before I let him die.
ACE: Here's the chess set.
DOCTOR: No, no! Don't touch!
ACE: Oh, thanks. I don't know why he used a chemical grenade. If I was him, I've have stuck a few sticks of explosives under the table.
JUDSON: At last, another of the Wolves of Fenric decides to show up and play his role.
HAEMOVORE: My world is dead.
JUDSON: Hardly a great loss, if you're the best evolution could manage. This is the twentieth century. It doesn't become your world for a long time yet. First, you must kill all humans.
DOCTOR: Another of Fenric's traps.
ACE: Well, at least I managed to grab the consolation prize.
DOCTOR: Ha, ha, well done. The parish records. Great.
ACE: What I can't understand is what's so special about them.
DOCTOR: Names.
ACE: Whose names?
DOCTOR: Names of ancient families. Judson, Millington, Wainwright, Dudman.
ACE: Dudman! Kathleen Dudman, she's got a chess set.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Millington destroyed them all.
ACE: No, no. I saw it in her suitcase.
DOCTOR: Come on!
BATES: Ready? Now!
BATES: Are they Russians?
MILLINGTON: Russians, German, British. They're enemy.
Sorin and Vershinin discover the last of their men, all dead.)
SORIN: We are the last two.
VERSHININ: This isn't war. This is massacre.
SORIN: The Ultima machine has done this.
VERSHININ: Destroy it.
SORIN: Go that way.
MILLINGTON: Your creatures are killing my men! What is it?
JUDSON: We call him the Great Serpent.
MILLINGTON: And the Great Serpent shall rise from the sea and spew venom over all the Earth.
JUDSON: There's enough poison in here to contaminate the world forever.
BATES: They're insane. They're trying to control the world with chemical weapons.
DOCTOR: All part of Fenric's evil game, no doubt, like this weather.
BATES: I know. 
BATES: Let's join forces, fight the real enemy.
SORIN: That's a really good idea.
ACE: So we're all on the same side again?
SORIN: You have the spirit of a fighter. And you wear our emblem.
ACE: Oh, it's not a real one. I bought it cheap in a market.
SORIN: Have the real one, tovarich.
DOCTOR: Come on! We've got to get Kathleen's chess set.
LEIGH: It's all right, girls. We'll take over now.
KATHLEEN: Ace!
DOCTOR: The chess set?
ACE: In the suitcase.
KATHLEEN: Oh, don't leave me!
ACE: I can't leave them. I'll stay here.
DOCTOR: Well, don't leave the hut.
JEAN: You don't have the emblem this time.
SORIN: But I still have my faith.
CRANE: Oh no! Oh, please! Please! Please!
JUDSON: Nurse Crane. You've looked after me all these years. Almost a mother, treating me like a child, humiliating me. I feel this is what Doctor Judson would have wished.
CRANE: Oh no! No, please! Argh!
ACE: We've got to do something about this room.
KATHLEEN: All right. Let me just sort the baby out, okay?
ACE: Let's use the furniture.
KATHLEEN: Right, let's put that bunk up against the door.
ACE: Okay. What about the wardrobe over the window?
KATHLEEN: Good idea. Let's use that and the other bunks up against the window.
ACE: Yeah.
MILLINGTON: I'm afraid you've had a wasted journey.
MILLINGTON: But then you were never really our allies, were you? Your people will always be the enemy.
VERSHININ: See you in hell.
ACE: I don't like dark buildings. There was one in Perivale, an old, empty house full of noises. Evil. Things I didn't understand. Undercurrents.
KATHLEEN: What kind of a world is this to bring up a child in?
ACE: Quick, the window!
KATHLEEN: Ace, take Audrey.
ACE: Quick!
DOCTOR: That's it. No, that's not right! It was so long ago. There.
ACE: In the jeep. Get in. Quick!
KATHLEEN: Where shall I go? What shall I do?
ACE: Go to London. My Nan'll look after you.
KATHLEEN: Where?
ACE: She lives in Streatham. Seventeen Old Terrace. Say it.
KATHLEEN: Seventeen Old Terrace. Wait, Ace. I want you to have this.
ACE:  I'll always love you. Now go! 
ACE: Seventeen Old Terrace.
KATHLEEN: Seventeen Old Terrace. Seventeen Old Terrace.
ACE: Now go! Go!
JUDSON: The Time Lord has made his move. Take the poison. Carry it to the ocean. Release it into the waters. 
HAEMOVORE: And the other haemovores?
JUDSON: Oh yes, they've been so useful. How could we have managed without them. You know how to kill them.
JUDSON: Where is the game, Time Lord?
DOCTOR: You couldn't resist it, could you? The game of traps. The contest as before. One move. Find the winning move. Spring the trap on me, if you can.
MILLINGTON: Are you going to use that gun? You know your problem, Captain Bates? You don't know who the enemy is. A traitor is someone who doesn't know who the enemy is.
VERSHININ: But I do.
DOCTOR: I've been waiting.
HAEMOVORE: You know me?
DOCTOR: Thousands of years in the future, the Earth lies dying, the surface just a chemical slime. Half a million years of industrial progress.
HAEMOVORE: I am the last. The last living creature on Earth. I watched my world dying with chemicals, and I could do nothing. My world is dead.
JUDSON: Who is it? Is that you, Time Lord? Tell me the solution. The contest is, is too much for such a weak body.
ACE: I don't know the solution.
JUDSON: Tell me. Tell me the solution.
DOCTOR: You're very patient. Carried back thousands of years in a time storm, to ninth century Transylvania, and waiting till now.
HAEMOVORE: Without the flask, I was trapped.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, the flask. I trapped him like an evil genie.
HAEMOVORE: Only he can return me to the future.
DOCTOR: And so, like a faithful servant, you follow the flask.
HAEMOVORE: A merchant bought it from Constantinople. I followed him through Europe. I followed the Viking pirates who stole it, and I followed it here.
DOCTOR: Another of Fenric's games. He carries you back in a time storm to destroy the Earth's water with chemicals, to destroy your future. Think on it. Your Earth, your world, dying of a chemical slime. This act will be the beginning of your end.
BATES: I owe you one.
ACE: What's happened? Are you all right?
BATES: We're all right now. We're fighting together now.
VERSHININ: War, a game played by politicians. We were just pawns in the game, but the pawns are fighting together now. Eh, comrade?
ACE: That's it. The solution. The winning move!
JUDSON: Where have you been?
SORIN: It's time to die, Fenric.
JUDSON: You don't understand. You don't know why you were selected for this mission.
SORIN: Because I speak English. My grandmother was English.
JUDSON: Emily Wilson, granddaughter of Joseph Sundvik. You are touched by the Curse of Fenric. I selected you. You are one of the Wolves of Fenric.
BATES: Are you sure you can stand?
VERSHININ: Workers of the world unite, comrade.
ACE: Fenric would never have guessed the solution, anyway.
SORIN: Tell me, tovarich.
ACE: A brilliant move. The black and white pawns don't fight each other, they join forces.
SORIN: Thank you, child.
DOCTOR: Ace!
SORIN: Black wins, Time Lord.
ACE: What's happened?
SORIN: The Wolves of Fenric, descendants of the Viking who first buried the flask, all pawns in my game. Doctor Judson, Commander Millington, the Ancient One, Captain Sorin, and now you.
ACE: Me? You can't! How?
SORIN: The baby. In thirty years, the baby will be grown. She will have a daughter. That daughter will be you. You've just created your own future.
SORIN: The baby is your mother. The mother you hate. Kill them, slowly.
ACE: You don't stand a chance. Tell him, Doctor. He's got it wrong.
SORIN: The Time Lord has failed. The Wolves of Fenric have released me.
ACE: The Doctor never fails. I've got faith in him. Complete faith.
SORIN: Kill them.
DOCTOR: It can't penetrate Ace's psychic force.
SORIN: Time for the one final game, then.
SORIN: The choice is yours, Time Lord. I shall kill you anyway, but if you would like the girl to live, kneel before me.
ACE: I believe in you, Professor.
SORIN: Kneel, if you want the girl to live!
DOCTOR: Kill her.
SORIN: The Time Lord finally understands.
DOCTOR: Do you think I didn't know? The chess set in Lady Peinforte's study? I knew.
SORIN: Earlier than that, Time Lord. Before Cybermen, ever since Ice World, where you first met the girl.
DOCTOR: I knew. I knew she carried the evil inside her. Do you think I'd have chosen a social misfit if I hadn't known? She couldn't even pass her chemistry exams at school, and yet she manages to create a time storm in her bedroom. I saw your hand in it from the very beginning.
ACE: Doctor, no.
DOCTOR: She's an emotional cripple. I wouldn't waste my time on her, unless I had to use her somehow.
ACE: No!
SORIN: Kill them.
SORIN: Kill them, do you hear me?
SORIN: No! No. I command you!
SORIN: No! No! No! No.
DOCTOR: Come on. It's over.
ACE: Leave me alone!
DOCTOR: We've got to get out of here!
ACE: Leave me alone!
ACE: Couldn't even pass a chemistry exam.
DOCTOR: I'd have done anything not to hurt you, but I had to save you from Fenric's evil curse. Your faith in me was holding the haemovore back.
ACE: You said I was an emotional cripple, a social misfit.
DOCTOR: I had to make you lose your belief in me.
ACE: Full marks for teenage psychology.
DOCTOR: It's not true, believe me.
ACE: I don't love her! She's my mum, and I don't love her! What's wrong with me? Why can't I stop hating her?
DOCTOR: You loved the baby.
ACE: But I didn't know she was my mum!
DOCTOR: Love and hate, frightening feelings, especially when they're trapped struggling beneath the surface. Don't be frightened of the water.
KATHLEEN : Audrey. It's all right, darling.
ACE : I'll always love you. I'll always love you. I'll always love you.
KATHLEEN : It's all right, darling. It's all right, darling.
ACE : I'll always love you.
ACE: I'm not scared now.
ACE: Dangerous undercurrents, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not any more. Niet.
