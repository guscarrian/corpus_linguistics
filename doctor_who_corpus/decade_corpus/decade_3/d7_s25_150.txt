Silver Nemesis
Part One
KARL: Herr De Flores. Herr De Flores. Wonderful news.
RICHARD: Very good, my lady.
PEINFORTE: How much longer?
RICHARD: He cannot hear you, my lady. Shall I
PEINFORTE: Leave him. There'll be time enough to punish his impertinence when he's finished.
PEINFORTE: Put this with the others. Are you so very feeble? The poison cannot harm unless the arrow's tip should break the skin. Let who will steal my gold.
RICHARD: And the silver arrow, my lady?
PEINFORTE: Leave that to me. You're sure the potion is well mixed?
RICHARD: On my life, ma'am. I guarantee it.
PEINFORTE: Good. We await but the calculation. Perhaps the fee will speed matters.
DE FLORES: Gentlemen. I wonder if even you can fully appreciate what this moment means. You're standing now at the turning point of history. The day of fulfillment of our mighty destiny is about to dawn. Fifty years ago, I stood at the side of the Fuehrer himself when he ordered the first giant step to greatness, just as now the moment approaches for the second and final one. It will be decisive, for this time, this time we must not fail. Gentlemen, I give you the Fourth Reich.
ALL: The Fourth Reich.
KARL: Herr De Flores, the aircraft is ready.
DE FLORES: We leave at once.
RICHARD: My lady, there is but the final ingredient for the liquid wanting. For that I was thinking
MATHEMATICIAN: My lady? Lady Peinforte? I've finished.
PEINFORTE: You have the answer?
MATHEMATICIAN: Yes, my lady.
PEINFORTE: Quickly, then. Tell me.
MATHEMATICIAN: The comet Nemesis will circle the heavens once every twenty five years.
PEINFORTE: Yes.
MATHEMATICIAN: It's trajectory, however, is decaying. This
PEINFORTE: When will it land?
MATHEMATICIAN: It will circle ever closer until finally it once again strikes the Earth at the point from which it originally departed, the meadow outside.
PEINFORTE: When?
MATHEMATICIAN: When. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. On the twenty third day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty eight.
ACE: I could listen to them all afternoon.
DOCTOR: And so we shall.
ACE: Have you seen this? Charlton picked up three points.
DOCTOR: This is my favourite kind of jazz, straight blowing.
ACE: I hate people whose alarms go off during gigs.
DOCTOR: What's this? It's a reminder.
ACE: Well, go on, then.
DOCTOR: Well, obviously, at this precise moment it's a reminder to change course for another destination.
ACE: Where's that?
DOCTOR: I've forgotten. Oh, we'll have to go back and find out.
ACE: Oh, Professor.
ACE: Excuse me, would you mind signing my tape?
COURTNEY: Not at all.
ACE: Thanks.
COURTNEY: Okay.
ACE: Bye.
DOCTOR: Don't you find it embarrassing asking for autographs?
ACE: Not as embarrassing as forgetting what you set your alarm for.
DOCTOR: Well, I probably arranged it centuries ago.
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Get down!
ACE: Who are they?
DOCTOR: Couldn't see. Quick, the Tardis.
ACE: Hope my tape's all right.
DOCTOR: Welcome home.
MATHEMATICIAN: I could build a flying machine. Imagine that, my lady. Human beings flying about like birds.
PEINFORTE: Bring the cups of potion. We leave at once.
RICHARD: The final ingredient, my lady? Human blood?
MATHEMATICIAN: Why, I can change the world.
PEINFORTE: Ah, yes.
DOCTOR : Ace!
ACE: Yeah?
DOCTOR : Duck.
DOCTOR: No, duck.
ACE: Oh, great. Now I can play my tape.
DOCTOR: Afraid not.
ACE: Why not? It's my tape deck. You built it for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know I built it for you to replace the one that was destroyed by the Daleks, but
ACE: So? It's my tape deck and I want to play this.
DOCTOR: This is more than just a tape deck. And besides, we've more to worry about than just listening to your tape.
ACE: Yeah. So who were they, anyway? Who'd want to kill us?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid there's an infinite number of possibilities. What concerns me more is my alarm. Got to find out what it was supposed to be.
ACE: Can't you remember anything about it?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not. Obviously the arrangements were made in rather a hurry. They are important. I've given them a terminal rating.
ACE: Sounds nice.
DOCTOR: It means that some planet somewhere faces imminent destruction.
ACE: Crikey.
DOCTOR: Quite.
DOCTOR: That looks familiar. Earth.
PEINFORTE: Afraid?
RICHARD: Yes, my lady.
PEINFORTE: When I employed you, you lead me to believe you were a hardened criminal.
RICHARD: As my lady knows, before I entered your service I was found guilty of a large number of offences.
PEINFORTE: Then have the courage of your convictions. Drink. Drink!
RICHARD: What's happening, my lady?
PEINFORTE: We are leaving, Richard. Destiny beckons. We ride the back of time.
RICHARD: No. No! No!
PEINFORTE: Come back, you fool. You'll break the aura.
RICHARD: I can't! Please, my lady. I must stay.
PEINFORTE: It's too late.
RICHARD: Where are we, my lady?
PEINFORTE: Why, the very place we left, of course. My house in Windsor.
ACE: You mean the world's going to end and you've forgotten about it?
DOCTOR: I've been busy.
ACE: How long have you known?
DOCTOR: Well, in strictly linear terms, as the chronometer flies, I've known since November the twenty third, 1638.
DOCTOR: Hello. Ow!
ACE: Look at all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what we've got to do, look at all this stuff. You take that aisle.
ACE: What's it all for?
DOCTOR: Presents.
ACE: Nobody gets this many presents.
DOCTOR: Well, if you were a lady who travelled.
ACE: I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're not always invited, but you are, you get presents, and then you need somewhere to store them.
ACE: Who does it all belong to? I mean, where are we?
DOCTOR: Windsor.
ACE: Windsor? We're in the castle?
DOCTOR: This is new.
ACE: I thought it'd be a lot posher than this.
DOCTOR: It probably is, upstairs, but we're in the vault.
DOCTOR: I'm looking for a silver bow we want to borrow.
ACE: We can't go nicking stuff in here.
DOCTOR: It's only temporary.
ACE: It's probably treason. I'm too young to go to the Tower.
DOCTOR: Listen, Ace, do I have to remind you that the safety of the world is at stake?
ACE: It might make a difference if you'd let me know what was going on, Professor, but I suppose there's no time.
DOCTOR: Precisely.
DOCTOR: There's even less time than I thought. Please, let's hurry.
PEINFORTE: Nemesis. She arrives.
ACE: Was that a bomb?
DOCTOR: No, that was the return to Earth of a comet called Nemesis that has been in orbit for exactly three hundred and fifty years.
ACE: You're amazing, Professor, being able to tell all that just from the noise.
DOCTOR: Wasn't difficult, really. It was me who launched it into space in the first place. This may qualify as the worst miscalculation since life crawled out of the seas on this sad planet.
ACE: Nobody's perfect. Hey, is this the bow?
KARL: We're almost at Windsor, Herr De Flores. Shall I let the men walk around a little?
DE FLORES: No, Karl. We must not keep history waiting.
RICHARD: My lady, what carriage is that?
PEINFORTE: Hurry. The rogues will have the Nemesis.
RICHARD: I've not seen the like of it before. We must take care.
PEINFORTE: Oh, fie.
DE FLORES: Nemesis has come to Earth on that piece of ground. In the new era, all this will be a shrine.
KARL: The men are ready in two assault groups. I will remain with you. We await only your order.
DE FLORES: Very good. Let's drive to the best hotel and refresh ourselves.
KARL: But Herr De Flores, there are only three policemen. We can take them now. You young people, always in such a hurry. Well, we were the same. Now, the statue is inside the meteor, which has just travelled through space. Have you any idea how hot it will be? How can we handle it? Since the British Government is completely unaware of its power, I'm sure we can rely on the police force to guard it safely until we're ready to collect it. I have every confidence in them.
DOCTOR: The bow was in the case.
ACE: Ah. This case contained the bow of Nemesis, property of the Crown, which disappeared mysteriously in 1788. Legend has it that unless a place is kept for the bow in the Castle, the entire silver statue will return to destroy the world.
DOCTOR: For once legend is absolutely correct. It has just returned.
DOCTOR: Oh, now this.
ACE: It's just the electricity.
ACE: It does that sometimes, even in the 1980s. What I want to know is, how can a statue destroy the world?
DOCTOR: I'll tell you three hundred and fifty years ago.
DOCTOR: Shush.
ACE: Sorry, Professor.
DOCTOR: There might be someone at home.
ACE: Okay, Professor. So where are we now?
DOCTOR: Windsor, of course. Only a few hundred yards from the Castle.
ACE: And is it really 1638?
DOCTOR: It certainly is. And furthermore, don't move.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: Stay where you are.
ACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: Something you don't want to see.
ACE: Who does this house belong to, anyway?
DOCTOR: A lady.
ACE: She's got funny ideas about home furnishings.
DOCTOR: Lady Peinforte's nothing if not original. I'm afraid this poor man was employed for his useful rather than his ornamental qualities. He's a scholar. He's done remarkably well. In a matter of months since I was last here, he's calculated the exact time and date when a comet called Nemesis will land on this planet. The twenty third of November.
ACE: 1988.
DOCTOR: And Lady Peinforte's rewarded him with her usual generosity.
ACE: So the bow belonged to her?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, no, no. Not to her. To a statue of her. She made the statue from the silver metal that fell out of the sky into that meadow out there.
DOCTOR: Hmm, this game is going rather badly.
ACE: Professor.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. There's no one here now, apart from our late friend. Lady Peinforte's around all right, in Windsor, but three hundred and fifty years in the future.
RICHARD: What means yon fellows? One speaks into his hand.
PEINFORTE: He summons guards. Oh, this cannot be.
RICHARD: Why so upset, my lady?
PEINFORTE: Because, fool, they will protect the Nemesis, and we know not their strength and weapons.
RICHARD: But, my lady, they know not what the comet is. Without the arrow, it is nothing. We must but watch and wait our chance to seize it.
PEINFORTE: Thou art not in all wise so useless, Richard.
RICHARD: My lady is too kind.
PEINFORTE: We shall withdraw and conceal ourselves.
POLICEMAN: Three one eight to base. Hey look, there's someone inside.
ACE: How can she get to 1988?
DOCTOR: She uses the silver arrow, of course, and she had some basic rudimentary knowledge about time travel. Black magic, mostly.
ACE: Black magic?
DOCTOR: Mmm, and what you might call a nose for secrets.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear.
ACE: So it wasn't just silver, this stuff that fell from the sky?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Lady Peinforte discovered it was something rather more unusual. A living metal. Validium.
ACE: Living metal?
DOCTOR: Yes, with just one purpose. Destruction.
ACE: But if you launched it into space, how come it's capable of destruction?
DOCTOR: Later, Ace.
POLICEMAN: Don't bother trying again, it looks like the battery's dead.
POLICEMAN: Hello? Hello?
GUIDE: You see here the guard. They're changed quite regularly. Of course, they're only changed in winter time. They normally stand here all the time in summer time. Now, will you follow me, please, ladies and gentlemen?
ACE: I've been here before.
DOCTOR: D�j� vu?
ACE: No, with the school.
DOCTOR: Oh, very droll. I haven't been here since they were building the place. You remember the way around?
ACE: Not really. Windsor Castle's a big place.
DOCTOR: Quite right. What we need's a guide. Come on.
GUIDE: Tower, and also further over there is the Mary Tudor Tower. Those gargoyles have been there for about five hundred years. They were built in 1509 originally, and the
ACE: I really don't think we should be doing this.
DOCTOR: This way? What do you think?
ACE: I don't know. I might be able to tell if I actually knew where we were going. We didn't actually cover the Royal residential areas on the school trip. There's someone coming.
DOCTOR: Act as if you own the place.
ACE: Do what?
DOCTOR: It always works. We own the place.
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: How annoying. I can't place that woman for the life of me.
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: It's all right, Ace. I know that woman from somewhere.
DOCTOR : What! Why didn't you say something?
ACE : You wouldn't let me.
DOCTOR: She's just the woman we need. Quick, after her. Ah ha!
DOCTOR: It'll be very useful to have the armed forces and the police on our side, and can you suggest a better person to ask?
ACE: Come on.
DOCTOR: There's no alternative.
RICHARD: I am in a nightmare, or mad.
PEINFORTE: This is no madness. Tis England.
RICHARD: But the noise, lady. The foul air.
RICHARD: Yes, my lady. What will my lady do when you possess the Nemesis?
PEINFORTE: Why, first have revenge on that predictable little man. He will soon arrive, Richard. Oh yes, I expect him. This time there'll be a reckoning with the nameless Doctor whose power is so secret, for I have found his secret out. In good time, I will speak it. I shall be his downfall.
DOCTOR: I've got to speak to her.
SECURITY: Be quiet. We'll have a doctor here soon.
DOCTOR: But I am a doctor!
SECURITY: Don't get excited. How did you get in here?
DOCTOR: I could tell you, but you won't believe me.
SECURITY: Try me.
DOCTOR: I travelled through time and space.
SECURITY: Oh dear, oh dear.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, very well, then. Let's forget about the armed forces.
ACE: But the Queen?
SECURITY: Are you a patient with him?
ACE: Now, you'd better listen to him, weasel features, 'cos he's the Doctor.
SECURITY: Oh, is he?
DOCTOR: Listen, the fate of every living creature on this planet hangs in the balance.
SECURITY: I don't believe you.
DOCTOR: You will believe me. You will let us go. You will not move.  You will move.
ACE: How did you do that?
DOCTOR: It's easy once you know how. You have to make a spectacle of yourself.
SECURITY: Hey!
DOCTOR: Only trouble is, it doesn't last long.
DOCTOR: Oh look, a Van Dyck.
ACE: Not now, Doctor.
ACE: Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me.
SECURITY: Excuse me.
ACE: What now?
DOCTOR: Back to the Tardis. We're obviously not going to get any help here.
ACE: Professor, that's me.
DOCTOR: What? Gosh, so it is. My goodness, what a good likeness.
ACE: How come I ended up here?
DOCTOR: Well, it hasn't happened yet.
ACE: But it's two hundred years ago.
DOCTOR: I know. We haven't done it. That's why you don't remember it.
ACE: It doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: Well, it did to Louis Armstrong, but then he really understood time.
SECURITY: There they are. Come on.
KARL: Herr De Flores, I don't understand how the police have already been overcome.
DE FLORES: That is of no importance. All that matters is the Nemesis is safe.
DE FLORES: Your strength returns. Soon you will be completely restored. But where's the arrow? The arrow, where is it?
DE FLORES: Find it. Find it!
DOCTOR: I only hope we're not to late.
DOCTOR: Er, don't be afraid. We won't harm you.
KARL: How did you get here? I searched that section, there was no one there.
DE FLORES: Never mind, Karl. You will see many signs and wonders in the days to come. Give me the arrow of Nemesis.
DOCTOR: Fortunately, I haven't seen it since 1638, when it disappeared along with the good Lady Peinforte.
DE FLORES: Rubbish. You. Where is the arrow?
ACE: I don't know anything about it.
DOCTOR: She really doesn't. Allow me to explain, Ace.
DOCTOR: For the validium to become active, it must have a sufficient quantity of critical mass. The statue alone is no good without the bow.
DE FLORES: I have the bow.
DOCTOR: And the arrow. Now, if someone could put the bow and arrow into the statue's hands
DE FLORES: They have the power of life and death, not only over this Earth but any planet in existence. You seem remarkably well-informed for someone who claims to know nothing.
DOCTOR: I simply notice what is obvious. You, apparently, don't.
DE FLORES: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: You see those policemen there? They've been attacked by technology more advanced and more terrible than you could imagine.
KARL: What technology?
DOCTOR: And you might also have observed the electricity supply being drained over the last few days.
ACE: Like at the Castle?
DOCTOR: Yes.
DE FLORES: Tell me where the arrow is. I want you to tell me where to find the arrow!
DOCTOR: I'm glad to say I can't.
DE FLORES: Then we will shoot her.
ACE: Doctor.
DE FLORES: Wait.
DOCTOR: Don't move!
ACE: They saved my life.
DOCTOR: Don't thank them yet. We might live to regret it.
ACE: What are they?
DOCTOR: Cybermen.
Part Two
LEADER: So, Doctor, a new appearance, otherwise our anticipation of your presence has proved entirely accurate.
LEADER: Eradicate them.
DOCTOR: Take cover.
ACE: Doctor!
ACE: Doctor, we can't stay here.
DOCTOR: We certainly can. This exactly the same thing that happened the last time. Only then it was the Roundheads and Lady Peinforte.
PEINFORTE: A hit. A very palpable hit.
PEINFORTE: See how my poison is as deadly as ever, Richard.
RICHARD: And I shall look after the sick. Which reminds me, I shall return to Briggs his money.
PEINFORTE: Get up, fool. I tell thee, Richard, were there men of silver like these here in our day, my life would have been quite different. Now I'll let them destroy each other, and then we'll take the Nemesis.
DOCTOR: Where did that come from?
ACE: Didn't see.
DOCTOR: A Cyberman killed with an arrow? But that's ludicrous, unless. Of course, the head's made of gold.
ACE: That's real gold?
DOCTOR: Yes. The only substance to which they're vulnerable.
ACE: Classy.
DOCTOR: Ah! Gold dipped in poison. Lady Peinforte's calling card.
ACE: I really think we should be getting out of here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I really think you're right.
RICHARD: My lady, who is that little man?
PEINFORTE: Oh, glorious evil. It is he.
PEINFORTE: No!
DE FLORES: We must retreat. It's our only chance.
KARL: And leave the statue?
DE FLORES: The statue alone is useless to them. The bow is ours. Get it.
LEADER: Bring the bow at once.
CYBERMAN: The Doctor and the female have escaped with it, Leader.
LEADER: And that one?
CYBERMAN: Terminated by another human female, using gold.
LEADER: This must be the Lady Peinforte.
RICHARD: My lady, there are people here.
PEINFORTE: Of course there are people. This is Windsor. Come.
LEADER: Cut the statue free and take it into the craft.
ACE: I don't like this place.
DOCTOR: We're just passing through, Ace.
ACE: What happened to the body? It's gone.
DOCTOR: Yes. Someone's moved the chess pieces.
DOCTOR: Voila!
ACE: Is that what we came here for?
DOCTOR: Our friend the mathematician was a genius, but he needed a little help to get started.
DOCTOR: Cold?
ACE: I really don't like this place. Can we make a move?
DOCTOR: Yes.
KARL: What is the gold dust for, Herr De Flores?
DE FLORES: Eventualities.
DOCTOR: Validium was created as the ultimate defence for Gallifrey, back in early times.
ACE: Created by Omega?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: And?
DOCTOR: Rassilon.
ACE: And?
DOCTOR: And none of it should have left Gallifrey. But, as always with these things, some of it did.
ACE: So you had to stop Lady Peinforte.
DOCTOR: Or anyone else.
ACE: From ever putting the three bits together.
DOCTOR: Yes, so I launched the largest piece into space.
ACE: But you got the sums wrong.
DOCTOR: Look. We're almost there.
ACE: I'd feel a lot safer and happier inside the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Well, the Cybermen might find the Tardis. This way, our validium leads us to their validium.
ACE: Isn't that a bit old-fashioned?
DOCTOR: I'm an old-fashioned guy.
SKINHEAD: You looking at me?
PEINFORTE: Stand aside.
SKINHEAD 2: What are you, social workers?
RICHARD: Out of my lady's way.
SKINHEAD: We want to tell you our problems.
PEINFORTE: Will you be turned into rats?
SKINHEAD 2: We already have been.
SKINHEAD: Poor ones. That's our problem.
SKINHEAD 2: Money!
RICHARD: Money, say you?
CYBERMAN: The remaining validium approaches, Leader.
LEADER: As predicted. Activate communications unit.
CYBERMAN: But the Doctor and Peinforte are still to be destroyed.
LEADER: Our victory is inevitable. The Doctor will come to us, and Peinforte is a simple savage accompanied by a terrified peasant.
ACE: What am I supposed to be listening for?
 
DOCTOR: That. Cybermen communicating.
ACE: I don't like Cybermen.
DOCTOR: You should see the ones they're communicating with.
ACE: Reinforcements?
DOCTOR: Yes. But if we could only jam their signal. Have you got a tape?
ACE: Yeah. You mean this thing transmits?
DOCTOR: Of course it does. I built it.
LEADER: Commence transmission.
CYBERMAN: Leader, I must repeat the objection to the transmission of incorrect information. Our forces do not yet hold all three units of validium.
LEADER: You are outside your function.
DOCTOR: Are we having fun?
ACE: Yeah.
CYBERMAN: Interference, origin unknown.
LEADER: Open the monitor channel.
ACE: That'll keep them busy. Time to go?
DOCTOR: Oh, I do love a jam session.
DOCTOR: This is ridiculous. Who did this to you?
SKINHEAD: Social workers.
RICHARD: My lady.
PEINFORTE: Of course I heard it. Am I deaf?
RICHARD: It sounds like a bear, but worse.
PEINFORTE: See, we're near the Nemesis. Come. The bear will not pursue us. Such things happen only in the theatre.
RICHARD: What creatures are these?
PEINFORTE: I know not.
RICHARD: They will eat us. I beg you, my lady, return us to our own time. The England now is full of terrors.
PEINFORTE: You're mad! Return without the Nemesis? Never. And without my knowledge, you cannot return at all. I tell you, Richard, either you assist me to regain it or I leave thee here forever. Now, come. I think they are peaceful.
RICHARD: What place, what place is this?
PEINFORTE: The piece of ground on which you stand? Well, I will tell thee. It is thy grave, Richard.
RICHARD: What?
PEINFORTE: I ordered you to be buried here when I planned my tomb. See, there's thy stone.
PEINFORTE: If the dogs would not eat thee, I ordered you put out here to attend me in the next world as in this. There you see is my burial place, and aptly the silver creatures there do hold the Nemesis. We shall attack.
DOCTOR: Just in time.
RICHARD: There's nothing here, my lady.
PEINFORTE: See the arrow? The statue's here, depend upon it.
LEADER: Now our plan begins to operate. She will find that her crypt has weathered with age. The fact of her death will drive her insane.
RICHARD: This is your tomb?
PEINFORTE: Rather fine, is it not? But where is the statue of Nemesis?
PEINFORTE : Where is it? Where?
CYBERMAN: Is this the human condition of madness, Leader?
LEADER: It is. Kill them.
PEINFORTE : It must be here. It must be!
RICHARD: My lady!
PEINFORTE: It is here! The arrow tells me. How can this be? Where? Where is it?
CYBERMAN: Gold!
DE FLORES: This was once the estate of the infamous Lady Peinforte, in the seventeenth century.
KARL: Lady Peinforte? But Herr De Flores, we've seen a woman in seventeenth century dress today, firing arrows at us and at men of silver.
DE FLORES: Shut up.
DOCTOR: I don't suppose you've completely ignored my instructions and secretly prepared any Nitro Nine, have you?
ACE: What if I had?
DOCTOR: Naturally you wouldn't do anything so insanely dangerous as to carry it around with you, would you?
ACE: Of course not. I'm a good girl. I do what I'm told.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blow up that vehicle.
LEADER: Destroy them. Destroy them!
CYBERMAN: We cannot sustain these losses, Leader. We must withdraw.
LEADER: No. We must hold the statue and retrieve the arrow from them.
CYBERMAN: If we are overcome, the entire strategy fails. The Cyber race will cease to exist.
LEADER: Your logic is correct. Their supply of gold is limited. Retreat.
PEINFORTE: Of course. Help me, Richard. Tis in my tomb. Help me!
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor! I believe you want to kill me.
LEADER: Betrayal. Kill them.
ACE: They killed them, just cos I blew up the ship.
DOCTOR: They were dead already. The Cybermen had transformed them. They were no longer human beings.
ACE: Is that why the Cybermen saved my life, so they could do that to me too?
DOCTOR: Probably. They were like people themselves before they turned themselves into Cybermen. Quite a lot of human beings are trying to follow their example.
RICHARD: My lady, where are your bones?
PEINFORTE: What matter?
DOCTOR: Are we still jamming them?
ACE: Tape's still running.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's see who's listening to it.
DOCTOR: Ah, sweet.
DE FLORES: We want to talk to you. I don't know if you're familiar with Wagner's Ring das Nibelungen. Now we, we are the supermen, but you, you are the giants. They are wonderful creatures.
LEADER: Of course, but why should we form an alliance with you?
DE FLORES: We had a leader once. He predicted your coming. Now together we shall fulfil his vision and reign over this world.
LEADER: Together? The Cyber race requires no help from humans.
KARL: But a woman who is almost less that human now holds the statue.
DE FLORES: And she's armed with the most primitive toys.
LEADER: You insult us.
DE FLORES: Of course not. Whatever your unfortunate vulnerability doesn't affect us. We can remove her for you.
LEADER: We accept. Destroy the woman and her servant, and we will divide the planet into your slave groups and ours.
DE FLORES: Good.
LEADER: But remember, betrayal will be fatal. We are invincible to your weapons.
DE FLORES: Come with me.
LEADER: Once they have the arrow and the statue, destroy them.
DOCTOR: Anything there?
ACE: Why am I doing this?
DOCTOR: That handful back there aren't the only Cybermen in the universe. We've got to find out where the others are.
ACE: Look, this is where the signal's being received, right?
DOCTOR: Right.
ACE: But according to the scanner there's nothing there.
DOCTOR: Then the scanner's wrong. That lot were only the advance party. Out there somewhere's the entire Cyberforce, and they want the Nemesis more than anything else in space.
ACE: How can you be so sure?
DOCTOR: Because it's 1988.
ACE: Huh. That makes sense.
DOCTOR: Listen, Ace. The Nemesis generates destruction. It affects everything around it. I launched it into space, but unfortunately with an orbit that brings it back to Earth every twenty five years. Take the twentieth century. It appeared in 1913.
ACE: The eve of the First World War.
DOCTOR: Twenty five years later?
ACE: 1938.
DOCTOR: Hitler annexes Austria.
ACE: 1963?
DOCTOR: Kennedy assassinated.
ACE: 1988.
DOCTOR: Check the scanner again.
DE FLORES: Unfortunately, Wagner must be rewritten. The supermen must control the giants. Only two illiterates stand between ourselves and the Fuhrer's dream. Come.
PEINFORTE: How perfect you are. Immaculate beauty carved in absolute evil.
RICHARD: But your bones, my lady? They should be buried
PEINFORTE: What matter? They are dead, but I live, and soon I shall have the bow and my Nemesis shall be complete.
PEINFORTE: We are attacked! Quickly, arrows.
RICHARD: We have but one left, my lady. I doubt that our arrows can stop these weapons anyway.
PEINFORTE: Nonsense. Make it count. They killed the silver creatures.
RICHARD: See, lady, we have no chance!
PEINFORTE: Nonsense. No man shall take the Nemesis. Her might is mine!
PEINFORTE: Not for nothing did I design my own tomb. Death is but a door.
PEINFORTE: I always knew I'd cheat it. Here, help me with the statue.
RICHARD: We can't lift it, my lady. We must fly!
KARL: Put up your hands.
PEINFORTE: Never!
RICHARD: You want the statue, master? Here, take it. Take it.
PEINFORTE: No!
RICHARD: Give her the arrow. See!
RICHARD: Forgive me, my lady.
PEINFORTE: Unhand me now!
PEINFORTE : No!
DE FLORES: No matter, Karl, no matter. They are of no importance. We have the statue, the arrow, and the bow.
KARL: And the Cybermen?
DE FLORES: Gold overcomes them. We have no such weakness. See how it prepares for life. Your first task must be to take control of the extraterrestrials.
LEADER: Unfortunately, that will not be possible.
DE FLORES: Keep away. I possess the entire statue of Nemesis. All power is mine. The life and death of everything in existence is in my hands.
LEADER: Then where is the bow?
DOCTOR: Of course. It's so simple. They're shrouded.
ACE: You what?
DOCTOR: Shrouded. They don't show up. But we must try and force them into revealing themselves. Treble. Bass. Please let me be right. Is anyone listening? Balance.
ACE: What are they?
DOCTOR: Cyber warships. Thousands of them. They were invisible.
Part Three
ACE: What can we do?
DOCTOR: I think our best move is to go to the crypt, unarmed, with the bow.
ACE: Professor, are you losing your marbles?
DOCTOR: We've got to get the bow into the statue's hands in order to activate the validium.
ACE: Is this the only way?
DOCTOR: I believe in the direct approach. You can always go back to the Tardis.
ACE: Are we going or what?
DE FLORES: Surely we, er, we can negotiate this er, this misunderstanding?
LEADER: Our understanding is perfect. You thought you had all three components of the statue, and naturally wished to destroy us.
KARL: You are completely mistaken.
LEADER: Silence.
CYBERMAN: Validium activity indicates proximity of the bow, Leader.
LEADER: Excellent. Kill them.
KARL: Herr De Flores.
DE FLORES: You fool, they're going to kill us.
KARL: Your day is over.
DE FLORES: You betray me? Have I taught you nothing?
KARL: Everything. Which is why we now part company. I'm afraid you failed to understand history in addition to Wagner.
DE FLORES: I?
KARL: Supermen are all very well, but the giants are the master race.
KARL: Here he is. Now make me one of you.
LEADER: You show potential. Very well. Have them programmed at once.
LEADER: We must complete the statue immediately. Locate the bow. Destroy the Doctor and his young friend.
RICHARD: How is it with you, my lady?
PEINFORTE: I understand not.
RICHARD: What's to understand?
PEINFORTE: Always I have treated you badly. I have done you no service, shown you no kindness, and yet you risk your life to save me. Why so?
RICHARD: Should I not?
PEINFORTE: I do not live in the world of what should. But you're a good man, Richard, and I am evil.
RICHARD: My lady, we have no more weapons.
PEINFORTE: No, you're wrong. I have one more yet that will not fail. My knowledge. I will have the statue of Nemesis.
ACE: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ace?
ACE: Look, let's be honest, right? I've never really bottled out of anything before, have I, but I'm really, really scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Why don't you go back to the Tardis? You'll be safe there, whatever happens.
ACE: No chance, Doctor. No chance.
CYBERMAN: The Cyberfleet are still not receiving our transmission, Leader.
LEADER: Is there any pattern to the jamming signal?
CYBERMAN: It is meaningless.
CYBERMAN: Communication channels to the Cyberfleet are clear again, Leader.
LEADER: Excellent. Their arrival is imminent.
DE FLORES: You fool. Without the bow the statue's power is nothing.
LEADER: We will shortly obtain the bow.
DE FLORES: From the Doctor? Don't delude yourself. He is no common adversary. Do you think he'll simply walk in here and hand it over?
DOCTOR: Good afternoon.
LEADER: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. I'm sorry we couldn't have been here earlier, but we were held up on the way. I don't believe you've met my friend Ace.
LEADER: Give me the bow.
DOCTOR: Cyberleader moves pawn to discover check.
ACE: Ace replies by neatly castling with the bow.
LEADER: Give me the bow.
DOCTOR: Doctor en passant behind Cyberleader.
LEADER: Give me the bow!
DOCTOR: Doctor supports combination gambit.
LEADER: Take the bow from him.
DOCTOR: Middle game element with Cybermen.
LEADER: Kill him!
DOCTOR: End game. Illegal move, but checkmate!
DOCTOR: That seems to be in order.
DOCTOR: Run!
DOCTOR: The Tardis.
ACE: No statue?
DOCTOR: Now it's awake, it'll follow the bow.
PEINFORTE: Fear not, Richard. It is the Nemesis come alive.
RICHARD: Alive?
PEINFORTE: Why, yes. Which means it is complete, and now it shall be mine.
PEINFORTE: All power, all power past, present and future, shall be mine. Why, I shall be mistress of all of that is, all that shall be, all that ever was. Yes, all! All!
RICHARD: My lady, let us find some shelter.
PEINFORTE: How dare you! I shall lead and you follow!
ACE: Hey, why are we here? What's going on, Professor?
DOCTOR: Unfinished business. We don't want those to fall into the wrong hands, just yet.
ACE: How's the game going?
DOCTOR: Black's losing.
ACE: What happens to these calculations?
DOCTOR: Bishop takes rook. Someone steals them.
ACE: The same person who steals the bow? I mean, the same person who steals it in 1788?
DOCTOR: How should I know, Ace? Questions, questions. Queen takes bishop.
ACE: Who brought validium to Earth in the first place?
DOCTOR: But pawn takes queen.
ACE: What's really going on, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Checkmate. Black wins. Time to go. Take those gold coins. We may need them.
PEINFORTE: We needs must walk, Richard. We have no carriage.
RICHARD: We can avail ourselves of one of these steeds, my lady. I see the method. Sit you here and rest awhile.
LEADER: The Doctor must not lead the statue back to the rocket sleds. We will stop him.
DOCTOR: Ah. Now, the statue should be here any moment now. Everything depends on my final calculations. I can't get my figures wrong this time.
ACE: It's okay, Professor. I promise not to interrupt you.
DOCTOR: You are interrupting me.
ACE: Sorry.
DOCTOR: There's also another slight problem. The Cybermen could be here at any moment.
ACE: Don't worry, Doctor. I'll look after you.
DOCTOR: Aim at the chest panel. And I trust you remember my strict instructions never to cause any further explosions?
ACE: I'm a better person as a result, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. We're ready for anything.
PEINFORTE: All will be mine.
REMINGTON: Er, Cyril, honey, pull the automobile over. There's some people there who could use a lift.
REMINGTON: Where are you folks headed?
RICHARD: To Windsor, and it please you, ma'am.
REMINGTON: It surely does, honey. Jump right in.
KARL: Herr De Flores, your day is over.
DE FLORES:  You betray me. Have I taught you nothing.
KARL: We completely deceived them, Herr De Flores.
DE FLORES: Even I thought for a moment we were finished. I am not afraid of death, only of failing in my duty.
DOCTOR: Now, ah yes, the bow. The bow. The bow is essential. You shall have the bow.
REMINGTON: You must be parched from standing in the sun. May I offer you a little refreshment?
RICHARD: Thank you, no, madam.
REMINGTON: Oh. Are you folks students?
RICHARD: Alas, I am but a servant, and cannot read or write.
REMINGTON: Oh.
RICHARD: My mistress is of noble birth, and has some Latin and a little Greek.
REMINGTON: Well, you must be on vacation at this time.
RICHARD: Go you far, ma'am?
REMINGTON: Far? Oh, I just came over from London.
RICHARD: Two days ride.
REMINGTON: Well, no, actually the traffic was pretty reasonable. I left about, let's see, forty minutes ago.
RICHARD: Forty minutes?
REMINGTON: Folks from the south are never in a hurry. As a matter of fact, I'm here on a visit, checking out my roots.
RICHARD: Tis wise with crops this time of year, ma'am.
REMINGTON: Oh.
NEMESIS: I am beautiful, am I not?
ACE: Yes. You're very beautiful.
NEMESIS: It is only my present form. I have had others which would horrify you. I shall have those again. You are surprised I speak?
ACE: I know you're living metal.
NEMESIS: I am whatever I am made to be. This time Lady Peinforte called me Nemesis, so I am retribution.
ACE: Catch you later.
REMINGTON: Well, my family came from around here. I traced them all the way back to the sixteen hundreds.
PEINFORTE: All things will soon be mine.
REMINGTON: I guess they will, honey.
PEINFORTE: Time past, present and future. Power invincible.
LEADER: Destroy the human female. Find and destroy her!
PEINFORTE: The secret of the heavens.
REMINGTON: Virginia is heaven, if you ask me. My family owns a little land there. They used to own a little land around here, too. The Remingtons of Remington Grange.
PEINFORTE: I know them. Thieves and swindlers all.
REMINGTON: You study history?
PEINFORTE: Dorothea Remington did bribe away my cook.
REMINGTON: Oh. Now, let me see. Yes, there was a Dorothea. She died in sixteen
PEINFORTE: Twenty one. Twas a slow poison.
REMINGTON: This is unbelievable.
PEINFORTE: Many found it so.
REMINGTON: Here I am, driving around, and I pick up someone who's researched my family tree.
PEINFORTE: We ride to destiny.
REMINGTON: We surely do, honey. We surely do.
DOCTOR: And now, we'll set the rockets for the correct projection, and then you will be on course for the Cyberfleet.
ACE: Why? You're going to kill me anyway.
LEADER: We detect only one more piece of gold.
ACE: Correct. So who'll be next, and who'll be lucky?
LEADER: Kill her.
DOCTOR: The rockets are now locked in to a destination. Now, let's see how the Cyberfleet is progressing.
DOCTOR: Right on course.
NEMESIS: And I'm to destroy the entire Cyberfleet?
DOCTOR: Forever.
NEMESIS: And then?
DOCTOR: Reform.
NEMESIS: You might need me in the future, then?
DOCTOR: I hope not.
NEMESIS: That is what you said before.
DOCTOR: Enough.
NEMESIS: And after this, will I have my freedom?
DOCTOR: Not yet.
NEMESIS: When?
DOCTOR: I told you when.
DOCTOR: Things are still imperfect.
DOCTOR: Stop! Harm her in the slightest, and I will destroy this bow!
CYBERMAN: Give us the bow, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No.
CYBERMAN: We shall simply take it and kill you both.
DOCTOR: Ah.
CYBERMAN: In any case, your threat was meaningless. How could you have destroyed the bow?
DOCTOR: Well, actually, I would have arranged to have the bow neatly placed in front of the rocket sled. Then I would have arranged the rockets to test fire at a pre-arranged time. By the way, Ace, what is the time?
ACE: Well, it's almost
ACE: Is that it, Doctor? Oh no, not you again.
DE FLORES: The bow.
DE FLORES: We have both succeeded in deceiving the Cybermen.
KARL: They made the mistake of assuming all human beings to be weak, corruptible. We, however, are loyal to the death.
DE FLORES: The long journey is over. You will be worshipped forever. Doesn't she speak?
DOCTOR: Not to the likes of you.
DE FLORES: She will. Well, Doctor, we must part. And thank you for removing the Cybermen. Now the Nemesis is finally mine.
ACE: I'm sorry, Doctor. I thought I'd got him.
LEADER: Give me the bow, or I will kill her.
PEINFORTE: All things, all power. Time, space, the world.
LEADER: She is mad.
RICHARD: Speak not of my lady so.
PEINFORTE: See, I am here.
ACE: What do you want?
PEINFORTE: My Nemesis.
ACE: You're too late. The Doctor's got it.
PEINFORTE: It is incomplete until it holds the bow. That may be given over to anyone. It will now be given to me.
LEADER: No! To us.
PEINFORTE: You are nothing. Only the Doctor matters, and he is but a pawn in the game of my making.
ACE: Listen, you old bag.
RICHARD: Silence!
ACE: The Doctor's not just going to give you the bow. Tell her, Doctor. Tell her.
PEINFORTE: Doctor who? Have you never wondered where he came from, who he is?
ACE: Nobody knows who the Doctor is.
PEINFORTE: Except me.
ACE: How?
PEINFORTE: The statue told me.
ACE: All right, so what does it matter? He's a Time Lord, I know that.
PEINFORTE: Well, Doctor?
DOCTOR: If I give you the bow
PEINFORTE: Your power becomes mine, but your secrets remain your own.
DOCTOR: It's all over, Ace. My battle, all my battles, I've lost. I can only surrender.
PEINFORTE: Yes.
DOCTOR: But not to you. The Cybermen will have the Nemesis.
LEADER: This is most rational, Doctor.
PEINFORTE: But I know your secrets.
DOCTOR: Very well, tell them.
PEINFORTE: I shall tell them of Gallifrey, tell them of the old time, the time of chaos.
DOCTOR: Be my guest.
PEINFORTE: Your secrets
LEADER: The secrets of the Time Lords mean nothing to us.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Thank you for coming to the twentieth century and giving me assistance. Thank you for bringing the arrow. You may go now.
PEINFORTE: What?
DOCTOR: You had the right game, but the wrong pawn. Check.
LEADER: Enough, Doctor. Cancel the statue's destructive capability.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Do you understand the Cyberleader's instructions?
NEMESIS: Perfectly.
ACE: Please don't surrender, Doctor.
LEADER: Prepare it for launching to liaise with our fleet. You have the position from this device.
LEADER: A new and final era begins, Doctor. Imagination, thought, freedom, pleasure, all will end.
LEADER: The Earth will be transformed into our base planet, the new Mondas. Before I kill you all, you may watch the arrival of our fleet. Launch the Nemesis.
ACE: Let them kill me, Doctor. Don't surrender.
DOCTOR: Stand back. She's ready for launching.
ACE: Nice rocket technology, Doctor.
LEADER: We will watch its progress.
DOCTOR: Certainly.
LEADER: This is impossible. You gave my instructions to the statue.
DOCTOR: Yes, I gave your instructions to the Nemesis, and it understood them. It understood them, and disobeyed them, and destroyed the Cyberfleet.
LEADER: Then you will join them.
DOCTOR: It's worth it.
DOCTOR: That seems to be that. Thank you.
RICHARD: It was nothing, Doctor. I wish I could have saved my lady, too, but she was one with your statue. How shall I live now, stranded, a stranger in this time?
DOCTOR: I know how you feel. However
ACE: He'll give you a lift.
DOCTOR: Back to 1638?
RICHARD: It's possible?
DOCTOR: Anything's possible.
ACE: So you sent the Nemesis off into space to draw the Cybermen so you could finish them off.
DOCTOR: I suppose I did. How clever of me.
ACE: Just like you nailed the Daleks.
DOCTOR: As I said, Ace. Unfinished business.
ACE: There's still one question you haven't answered.
RICHARD: We have none of this jazz whereof you speak, Doctor, but I think you will like this.
ACE: Professor? Doctor? Who are you?
