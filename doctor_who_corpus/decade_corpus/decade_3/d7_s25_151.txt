The Greatest Show in the Galaxy
Part One
RINGMASTER: Now welcome folks, I'm sure you'd like to know, we're at the start of one big circus show. There are acts that are cool and acts that amaze. Some acts are scary and some acts will daze. Acts of all kinds, you can count on that, from folks that fly to disappearing acts. There are lots of surprises for the family at the Greatest Show in the Galaxy! So many strange surprises, I'm prepared to bet, whatever you've seen before, you ain't seen nothing yet.
ACE : Professor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE : Have you seen my Nitro Nine?
DOCTOR: Isn't it in your rucksack?
ACE : Yeah, but where's my rucksack?
DOCTOR: Interesting question.
ACE: Things don't just vanish.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: What's that peculiar noise?
ACE: What peculiar noise? I don't hear any peculiar.
DOCTOR: How extraordinary.
DOCTOR: It materialised inside the Tardis. Just the kind of thing you'd expect to see in this part of the galaxy.
ACE: Is that just what you'd expect too, Professor?
DOCTOR: Not entirely, no.
ADVERT: Yes, it's festival time at the Psychic Circus, the Greatest Show in the Galaxy! So why not come along and have the time of your life with the nonstop action of its glittering circus ring. There's big prizes
ACE: No, I don't believe it. Junk mail. Used to get loads of this stuff through the letterbox and now we're being bombarded with it inside the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Yes, junk mail gets everywhere.
ADVERT: If you want to watch or you want to compete, there's a great time for you on the planet Segonax. The planet has easy access via our special polyportable landing bays.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace, I thought you'd have been interested in the circus.
ACE: No, kid's stuff. I went once. Didn't even have any tigers. It was naff and it was boring. Apart from the clowns, of course.
DOCTOR: What, you found them funny?
ACE: No, creepy.
DOCTOR: I think you're being very unfair. A lot of the acts in the circus require a great deal of skill and courage. That's something you should appreciate. Anyway, I rather fancy entering the Festival talent contest myself.
ACE: Oh no, not the spoons again.
ADVERT: Scared?
ACE: What?
ADVERT: Scared to come to the Psychic Circus?
ACE: No.
ADVERT: Scared to take part?
ACE: No, course not.
ADVERT: Well, if you are, then go ahead, ignore me. I quite understand.
ACE: I don't believe it. Junk mail that talks back.
DOCTOR: Shall we just fling it away and forget about it? I mean, I'm sure the Psychic Circus isn't scary at all. It's just a device to get us to go.
ACE: Okay, you win, junk box. I'm not scared of anything.
FLOWERCHILD: Come on, we can't give up now.
BELLBOY: They'll catch us, I know it. They'll drag us back to the circus.
FLOWERCHILD: Oh, Bellboy, please. You promised. You know it's down to us now. We're the only ones left to fight. Come on.
BELLBOY: Flowerchild, look. Your kites, your beautiful kites.
DOCTOR: So this is Segonax. Not quite the green and pleasant land we'd been led to expect. Still, I've had good reports of the friendliness of the natives.
ACE: Don't see these landing bays, Professor.
DOCTOR: Oh, I expect that's for those not fortunate enough to possess a Tardis.
ACE: So now where?
DOCTOR: I'll ask for directions over there.
DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I'm the Doctor, this is my friend Ace.
STALLHOLDER: What sort of costume do you call that?
DOCTOR: I don't understand.
STALLHOLDER: And her's is no better. We don't want your type around here.
DOCTOR: Ah, and what type might that be?
STALLHOLDER: Wierdos. You can tell them at a glance, you know.
ACE: Friendly natives, eh, Professor?
DOCTOR: Let's not be hasty.
FLOWERCHILD: There's no choice.
BELLBOY: No. The kites will track us forever.
FLOWERCHILD: One of us must get there.
FLOWERCHILD: I want you to have this.
BELLBOY: Thanks. Look, I'll wait here awhile and see if I can find a longer route round. I shall draw them after me.
FLOWERCHILD: No silly risks, now.
BELLBOY: Go on. Go on.
CLOWN: They can't have lost them.
CLOWN: I thought not.
BELLBOY: Come on, kites. Find me.
ACE: Yuck. Do we really have to eat this muck?
DOCTOR: Elementary diplomacy, my dear Ace. She apparently thinks we're a pair of undesirable intergalactic hippies. We must try and convince her we're nice, clean-living people who eat up all our fresh fruit and pay our way.
ACE: Paying good money for this muck is daylight robbery. Do I have to finish it?
DOCTOR: Every last bite. Besides, we want the charming lady to tell us how to find the circus, don't we. Delicious, madam. Quite delicious.
BELLBOY: Come on, then! It's me, Bellboy. It's who you're looking for, isn't it? What are you waiting for? Come on!
STALLHOLDER: More?
DOCTOR: Er, no. Delicious but extremely filling. I'm sure you will have gathered by now, dear lady, we're not the kind of hobbledyhoys and vagabonds you take such exception to. Indeed, as I said before, I'm known as the Doctor.
STALLHOLDER: Some people will call themselves anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, be that as it may, we would appreciate your help. You see, we're looking for
STALLHOLDER: Here comes another one of your lot.
ACE: Look at that ace bike, Professor.
ACE: Need a hand? I reckon it could be a stuck valve.
NORD: Get lost.
ACE: It's a great bike.
NORD: Go on, hop it, before I get angry.
ACE: Well, if you don't want to save yourself some time, then it's up to you. Course, it could be a valve
NORD: I've told you, girl, get lost! Or I'll do something horrible to your ears.
ACE: Suit yourself. I hope your big end goes.
STALLHOLDER: He'll be going there. They all go there, you know.
DOCTOR: Go where?
STALLHOLDER: The Psychic Circus. All the riff-raff go there. All the infernal extraterrestrials like him. Monopods from Lelex, Doctors.
DOCTOR: I don't understand. You say that he's going to the circus?
STALLHOLDER: Of course. Everyone of them who's up to no good goes there. We locals wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.
DOCTOR: Is it far, this appalling spectacle?
STALLHOLDER: Miles and miles. Why do you suppose he's got that noisy monstrosity polluting the countryside? Here, you're not thinking of going there, are you?
DOCTOR: No, no, the very idea, no. Just a moment, would you excuse me?
DOCTOR: Ace, any chance of a lift, do you think?
ACE: Worth a try, I suppose. He doesn't look after that bike, you know. If only he'd let me have a go,
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, never mind, Ace. Let's concentrate on getting a lift to the circus. Excuse me. If you're going to the circus, I wonder if could possibly give
NORD: Do you want me to do something unpleasant to your face?
DOCTOR: No, not really, no.
NORD: No one rides with me! For I am Nord, Vandal of the roads.
CONDUCTOR: Hold tight please.
DOCTOR: Well, there's nothing like a nice walk in the countryside.
ACE: And this is nothing like a nice walk in the countryside.
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, it could be worse. You could be carrying that heavy rucksack of yours.
ACE: Yeah, what about my rucksack, Professor? What did you do with it?
DOCTOR: They seem to be in rather a hurry. Looking for customers.
ACE: Well, I wouldn't be so chuffed if I kept getting visitors like Nord the Vandal, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's true. But then, how do they expect a hard case like him to going to the circus anyway?
ACE: Maybe he got conned, like I was.
DOCTOR: Something evil's happened here, I can feel it.
ACE: To do with the circus?
DOCTOR: Who knows.
ACE: Doctor, look.
CAPTAIN: I was probably the first person to visit the valley for several millennia, at the very least. So something like this, which for the ordinary dull old stop-at-home might seem quite extraordinary, is just run of the mill as far as I'm concerned. Well, of course since you've never been
MAGS: Captain.
DOCTOR: Greetings. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Ace.
CAPTAIN: And I am Captain Cook, the eminent intergalactic explorer. You happen to have heard of me, old boy?
MAGS: And I am Mags.
NORD: Oi, white-face. White-face! Where do I park for the gig at the Psychic Circus?
CAPTAIN: Mmm, delicious. My own special blend, of course. I take it everywhere. Bet you can't guess the blend, eh, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, I could be wrong, of course, but isn't it from the Groz Valley of Melogothon?
CAPTAIN: Good. Very good.
ACE:  I'll give you a hand.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ace, wait a minute.
CAPTAIN: Were you ever on Melogothon, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well as a matter of fact, I was.
CAPTAIN: The frozen pits of Overod are worth seeing, of course, though much overrated, I feel. All right for the trainee explorer. Old hands like myself need something a bit more exotic.
DOCTOR: Why come here, then?
CAPTAIN: Sorry, old boy?
DOCTOR: I said, why bother to come here?
CAPTAIN: Well, I'm told the Psychic Circus is quite an interesting little show, particularly at this time, when everybody turns up to compete in the Festival. Yes, besides, she wanted to come.
DOCTOR: Do you often travel together?
CAPTAIN: Of late, yes. I found her on the planet Vulpana. Between you and me, old boy, she's rather an unusual little specimen.
DOCTOR: Of what?
CAPTAIN: Ah, that would be telling, old boy. What about yours?
DOCTOR: I never think of Ace as a specimen of anything.
CAPTAIN: Keep your shirt on, Doctor. Everything's a specimen of something. Take that robot over there, for example.
ACE: What do you reckon, Professor?
DOCTOR: I suppose it was buried for some good reason.
ACE: Well, maybe we'll find out what that reason was, eh, Professor?
ACE: Gordon Bennett!
DOCTOR: Quick. Help, Captain.
CAPTAIN: You don't often see one like that, do you.
DOCTOR: I've seen ones like this quite often enough, thank you very much.
ACE: Do something! I've got it.
CAPTAIN: Well, well. More tea, perhaps?
BELLBOY: Excuse me.
STALLHOLDER: You can't lie down there, you know.
BELLBOY: At last.
CLOWN: Where's the girl?
BELLBOY: She'll have reached there by now.
CLOWN: If she has, she'll regret it.
STALLHOLDER: Is there no end to you wierdos?
CAPTAIN: It's obviously some sort of shrine. I saw one much like this on Dioscuros.
DOCTOR: A shrine or not, I can't help feeling something sinister happened here.
CAPTAIN: I wonder you manage to explore anything. Everything seems to alarm you so.
DOCTOR: Not everything. I trust my instincts, and you may recall they're not always wrong.
ACE: Oh, come on, Professor. Let's go and explore.
CAPTAIN: I agree with your young friend. Let's explore.
ACE: Here, look at this.
CAPTAIN: I say. Well, well, well, it is quite something.
ACE: Wonder if it still goes.
CAPTAIN: Yes.
DOCTOR: Ace, I wouldn't.
CONDUCTOR: Any more fares, please? Any more fares, please? No standing inside. Hold tight, please.
CAPTAIN: I say, steady on, old chap.
CONDUCTOR: Fares please. Hold on tight. Ding, ding.
CAPTAIN: No, no, no, you've got it wrong, old boy. He's paying the fares, not me.
CONDUCTOR: Any more fares?
DOCTOR: I would like a ticket, actually. I'd like a there and back off peak weekend break supersaver senior citizen bimonthly season with optional added facilities a free cup of coffee in a plastic glass a crocodile sandwich and make it snappy, you mechanic moron!
DOCTOR: If I might take a look at that ticket machine of yours?
DOCTOR: Ah, yes.
DOCTOR: Just the ticket.
MORGANA: What have you done?
CLOWN: Not nearly enough.
MORGANA: We need him.
CLOWN: He'll have to be punished, Morgana.
BELLBOY: Flowerchild?
MORGANA: No.
BELLBOY: Flowerchild.
MORGANA: Where is she?
CLOWN: He still thinks she may have escaped.
MORGANA: Listen, Bellboy, I
CLOWN: Save your breath. Take him back in the ring. He knows what's waiting there.
BELLBOY: No. No. No! No! No!
MORGANA: What if a visitor arrives now?
CLOWN: If they come, they come.
CAPTAIN: Letrepos, for example. Sights like this are every day.
DOCTOR: Some people can't bear to be proved wrong.
ACE: He'd have let tinhead do you in.
DOCTOR: Oh, let's not bear a grudge. He can't help being a pompous, selfish, self-satisfied meddler.
ACE: Hmm. Mags might be okay if he wasn't around.
DOCTOR: If a little odd.
ACE: Doctor, look.
DOCTOR: Do you like it?
ACE: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well, if the keeper's not here, the finder has it.
ACE: Ace.
ACE: What do you reckon happened here, Professor? Were the people in this bus attacked on their way to the circus?
DOCTOR: Presumably. Whoever attacked them, destroyed them and wrecked the bus.
ACE: And the evil you felt, was that the bus conductor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Anyway, whoever left him here on guard's gone now. Perhaps millennia ago.
ACE: Nothing to do with the circus being scary?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid I think not. No, that was all just good publicity.
ACE: Pity. It might have made it more interesting. Are we still going there then?
DOCTOR: Yes. I feel just in the right mood. And after two brushes with death in one day, I hope you might be.
ACE: If you say so, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah, so, Doctor. You can remember.
CAPTAIN: On one of my trips to Neogorgon there was a whole planet with electronic dogs' heads submerged in mud.
WHIZZKID: Hi!
STALLHOLDER: Hello, young man. Just arrived from the landing port?
WHIZZKID: That's right.
STALLHOLDER: Oh, you've no idea what a relief for me it is to see such a nice, clean, respectable young man, after the riff-raff I usually have to deal with. Can I help you at all?
WHIZZKID: Yes, please. Could you tell me the way to the Psychic Circus?
CLOWN: The show is about to start.
MORGANA: I've seen enough already.
CAPTAIN: Greetings, my good woman. This is the Psychic Circus, isn't it?
MORGANA: Why yes, that's right.
CAPTAIN: Ah, sounds like things are going well. Come along, Mags.
MORGANA: But er
CAPTAIN: But what?
MORGANA: You can't go in just now. There is a speciality act being rehearsed.
CAPTAIN: All the better, my dear.
MORGANA: No, you don't understand.
CAPTAIN: Thank you, my good fellow. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Not as far as we feared. Look.
ACE: I still think clowns are creepy.
DOCTOR: Nonsense.
DOCTOR: Listen, they're having a good time in there.
ACE: Don't you hear it?
DOCTOR: Hear what?
ACE: That screaming.
DOCTOR: I can't hear anything.
ACE: I was sure I heard
DOCTOR: Oh, you're just making excuses because you don't like circuses.
ACE: No. No, it's not that.
DOCTOR: Well, are we going in or aren't we?
Part Two
CLOWN: Two more.
MORGANA: Right.
ACE: I did hear it, that screaming.
DOCTOR: But not now.
DOCTOR: So we can go in?
ACE: Yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: Your enthusiasm's overwhelming.
MORGANA: Welcome one and all to the Psychic Circus.
DOCTOR: Ace, you promised.  I'm the Doctor and this is Ace. I must apologise for my young friend.
MORGANA: Oh, it is no problem. All of us around here believe in letting our feelings hang out. I mean, there is no point in getting uptight, now is there?
ACE: I don't believe this.
MORGANA: That is why we got into circuses in the first place.
DOCTOR: We?
MORGANA: The founder members of the Psychic Circus.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see.
MORGANA: We were really into personal expression and the Circus gave us a chance to develop ourselves by expressing our individual skills.
DOCTOR: I wonder if you've a special skill, if I might enquire.
MORGANA: Fortune telling. Would you like to see the future?
DOCTOR: Not just yet.
DOCTOR: The Psychic Circus has grown into quite a sizeable operation, by the looks of it.
MORGANA: The greatest show in the galaxy.
DOCTOR: Quite so, yes. My, you have travelled, haven't you? The planet Othris, the Boriatic Wastes, Marpesia and the Grand Pagoda of Cinethon.
MORGANA: Yes, we used to have a great time in the old days, going from planet to planet. But we've really got settled in here since
DOCTOR: Since?
MORGANA: Well, you have to hang up your travelling shoes and stop wandering sooner or later, don't you?
DOCTOR: So I've been told. Personally, I just keep on wandering.
RINGMASTER : Will you please take your seats, thank you.
DOCTOR: Ace?
ACE: Yes, Professor?
DOCTOR: Well, are we going in or aren't we?
MORGANA: You're sure you want to go in?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's why we came here in the first place.
MORGANA: Look, I don't know how to put this, but
MORGANA: Of course, go right in. Do your own thing. Enjoy yourselves.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Oh, tickets. We forgot to buy some tickets.
MORGANA: Tickets?
DOCTOR: To go in.
CLOWN: Ha ha! You're in already.
DOCTOR: Oh. Sounds as if you're doing really good business.
CLOWN: This way, please.
ACE: Professor.
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: I can't see a thing.
DOCTOR: Neither can I.
ACE: And the cheering's stopped.
DOCTOR: Perhaps we're between performances. Let's see if we can find a seat.
ACE: Found somewhere to sit, Professor?
DOCTOR: That's one way of looking at it, if we could see. Over here.
ACE: What?
DOCTOR: I said, over here.
DOCTOR: In a moment our eyes'll get used to the darkness.
ACE: Assuming there's anything worth seeing.
DOCTOR: Listen.
GIRL: Daddy. Daddy.
DAD: What?
GIRL: I want an ice cream.
DAD: You've already had one.
GIRL: But Daddy.
DAD: I told you once and I'm not going to tell you again. Now shut up and eat your popcorn.
DOCTOR: We're not alone.
ACE: Yeah, but it looks like it's just us and them. What a con. I mean, where's Mags and the Captain?
DOCTOR: Perhaps they haven't arrived yet. Who knows? Anyway, I'm going to have an ice cream.
MUM: They should be starting up again soon. Have a crisp, Father.
DOCTOR: Greetings. Not many in today, are there. Are you regulars or is this your first visit, too? Let me introduce myself. I'm
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. Delicious.
ACE: Professor. Professor, it's starting.
DOCTOR: Well, it's been a pleasure.
DOCTOR: Remarkable.
ACE: If you like this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: No, no, I mean the memorial stones. Do you see them? Look.
RINGMASTER: Now welcome folks, I mean that from the heart, because the Greatest Show is about to start. It's happening right here before your very eyes and one thing's for sure, you're in for quite a surprise. But then, nothing's quite as it seems to be at the Greatest Show in the Galaxy.
RINGMASTER: Now welcome folks, we've got a brand new act. He's a real find and no doubt that's a fact. He'll entertain you, he'll make you stare, and our great new act is seated over there!
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, but
RINGMASTER: Come on, Doctor. Don't be shy.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not really sure that I should.
RINGMASTER: Oh, no false modesty. We know you're good.
DOCTOR: Well, this is most unexpected. Are you sure you want me?
RINGMASTER: There's no mistake, Doc. Come on in. Feel free.
ACE: Don't go, Professor.
DOCTOR: Why, what harm could it do?
RINGMASTER: Exactly. But the decision's up to you.
ACE: No, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Well, you certainly didn't waste any time. I had expected to see what the opposition was up to before I put myself forward for the talent contest.
DOCTOR: But since you insist.
RINGMASTER: Oh, we do, but no doubt you'd like to get yourself prepared first.
DOCTOR: Well, yes, I
RINGMASTER: Let me show you and your charming assistant to your dressing room.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. Ace!
CLOWN: Where did you find that earring?
ACE: Are you a robot too?
CLOWN: No.
ACE: Pity.
CLOWN: So tell me where you found it.
CLOWN: After her.
RINGMASTER: Right this way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you very much, but where's Ace? I don't think she
RINGMASTER: Oh, she'll be coming.
CAPTAIN : Iniphitus, where the Galvanic Catastrophods are not what they were.
CAPTAIN: No, but they're still worth a look if you're doing a tour of the southern nebula and have an eon or two to spare. You. Well, well.
DOCTOR: Captain Cook, I presume. So you had arrived after all.
CAPTAIN: But of course. Come and join us, Doctor. It's one big happy family here, eh, Nord?
NORD: Except when you're gassing on.
DOCTOR: Well, I don't really think I
CAPTAIN: Nonsense, we're having a ball here.
DOCTOR: Very well then. Mags. Do sit down, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you very much.
CAPTAIN: Yes, there we are. Comfy?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CAPTAIN: That's the spirit.
CAPTAIN: Anything the matter, old chap?
DOCTOR: It's a trap! I've fallen into a trap! I've fallen for it.
CAPTAIN: Yes, I know, old boy. Never mind. Have some tea. A very similar thing happened to me once, you know.
DOCTOR: Why?
CAPTAIN: Why what?
DOCTOR: Why let me be trapped? It's so pointless. I could have saved you, Nord and Mags.
CAPTAIN: I wouldn't be too sure about that, Doctor. These circus chappies are pretty smart customers for all their let it all hang out mumbo jumbo.
MAGS: Maybe we could have escaped if we'd made a break for it there and then. If only you'd
CAPTAIN: Now, now, Mags. No use in getting upset, and that's an order.
DOCTOR: What about you? I mean, why didn't you speak up?
DOCTOR: What kind of answer's that?
CAPTAIN: Save your energy, Doctor. You'll soon see why. Anyway, all of us in here have developed a survival philosophy, which is why we welcomed you in.
DOCTOR: What is all this, then? I thought there was a talent contest going on.
CAPTAIN: Well, yes, but in a way it's more like a survival of the fittest.
CAPTAIN: Oh, that's Deadbeat. Yes, he does odd jobs about the place, makes the tea for me, things like that. Don't bother too much about him, though. Fellow's mind's completely gone.
DEADBEAT: Gone. Gone. Oh really gone. All really gone down the road again.
RINGMASTER: Well?
MORGANA: We have to talk.
NORD: Get out of it! I hate your sort, cos I'm Nord, see? The toughest infernal extraterrestrial there is.
DOCTOR: What a fool I've been.
CAPTAIN: Frankly, old chap, I have to agree.
DOCTOR: I should have listened to Ace.
CAPTAIN: Number one rule of the intergalactic explorer, Doctor. If you hear somebody talking about good vibes and letting it all hang out, run a mile.
MAGS: We didn't.
CAPTAIN: That's beside the point.
DOCTOR: What happens in there?
CAPTAIN: In where?
DOCTOR: In the ring, during the talent contest.
CAPTAIN: Something pretty nasty.
RINGMASTER [OC}: Next contestant ready, please.
CAPTAIN: Oh, here, Nord.
NORD: What?
CAPTAIN: Remember our agreement?
NORD: Eh? Oh, yeah, course.
CAPTAIN: Well, heads, heads or tails?
NORD: Tails.
CAPTAIN: Heads.
NORD: So?
CAPTAIN: You're on next.
NORD: I ain't going on next!
CAPTAIN: But we all agreed, didn't we, Mags?
CAPTAIN: Good girl.
CAPTAIN: He's next, I believe.
CLOWN: Get him ready.
DOCTOR: You were lucky, Captain.
CAPTAIN: Not really. I got a whole set of these silly little nick-nacks from some bug-eyed monster when I was on the planet Leophantos.
CAPTAIN: Like I said, Doctor. Every man for himself here.
DOCTOR: What am I supposed to do with these?
CAPTAIN: Practise juggling, I suppose. Your chances of survival in the ring are better, of course, if you keep them entertained.
DOCTOR: Why, do they let you out again?
CAPTAIN: No, but you last longer.
WHIZZKID: All right?
MORGANA: Just think of all those tickets we've sold. Does that make you feel good? It wasn't always like this, was it. Not before we came to this dreadful place. We used to have fun. We were free spirits then.
RINGMASTER: We are now.
MORGANA: You think so? It feels more like we're part of a machine.
RINGMASTER: Look, we're not leaving, if that's what you mean.
MORGANA: We must!
RINGMASTER: You keep saying that, but you haven't gone, have you?
MORGANA: I tried, but
RINGMASTER: Listen, just as long as they keep on coming, and they will, no doubt of that, we are a success. Don't you understand? An intergalactic success. Now, the others, they couldn't take the pace, that's all. Bellboy, Deadbeat, Flowerchild, the rest. Don't you understand? They wanted to live in the past, the old lazy way. Not us. We'll make the Psychic Circus known everywhere.
MORGANA: Known for what?
RINGMASTER: Well?
CLOWN: That new pair worry me. The girl that escaped had one of Flowerchild's earrings.
RINGMASTER: Have they found the girl?
CLOWN: Not yet, but she can't have gone far. I'll search for her myself.
RINGMASTER: Yeah, you do that. Make sure you find her.
MORGANA: And Bellboy?
CLOWN: Let's hope he's learned his lesson, shall we? We'd better get him back to work. Bellboy made them all. Bellboy can repair them.
MORGANA: But will he ever be able to
WHIZZKID: Hello. This is the Psychic Circus, isn't it?
MORGANA: Yes, that's right.
WHIZZKID: Oh great! I've come halfway across the southern nebula to be here. I want to enter the talent contest. I know all about the Psychic Circus, you see. In fact, I'm your greatest fan.
NORD: I'll show you. Easy. Easy!
DOCTOR: It frightens you, doesn't it, Mags?
MAGS: Oh, he'll be fine. Just like the other one was.
DOCTOR: You saw what happened in there?
MAGS: So?
DOCTOR: Aren't you going to tell me about it?
MAGS: See for yourself!
CAPTAIN: Don't bother Mags, Doctor, will you? You have to be careful with these rare specimens.
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
CAPTAIN: You'll see.
ACE: Look, I'm trying to help you, but you're not making it very easy. Can't you at least tell me what
ACE: Great. Don't tell them, will you?
CLOWN: Learnt your lesson, eh, Bellboy? No more running away now. Good, because I've got some important repair work for you to do. The Conductor's been damaged. That girl must be somewhere.
RINGMASTER: A man of might is Nord. And now he'll go for broke by making all you laugh with his most favourite joke.
NORD: Eh? What, do a gag? Like a joke? Yeah, well, I'm coming down like on the Psychic Circus tonight on the way
DOCTOR: Is this what you saw before?
MAGS: Not exactly, but just as bad.
DOCTOR: Would you let something like that happen to you?
MAGS: Would you?
WHIZZKID: It must be awfully exciting working for the Psychic Circus, Morgana. Particularly when you did your tour of the Boreatic Wastes. I think that most of your admirers would agree with me that that was one of your finest ever gigs. Well, in so far as you can tell from the posters
MORGANA: Would you like to be getting along inside?
WHIZZKID: You mean I can go in, just like that?
MORGANA: Yes. Go right now, please.
WHIZZKID: Oh wow!
CAPTAIN: Mags.
MAGS: What?
CAPTAIN: It's not going to work. I remember when I was on the baleful plains of Grolon, I
MAGS: I don't care.
DOCTOR: Ready?
DOCTOR: I believe I'm on first.
MAGS: No, I'm ahead of you.
DOCTOR: No, you're not.
MAGS: No, I am.
DOCTOR: I insist on going out first.
MAGS: Oh no, you don't.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I do!
RINGMASTER: Now listen folks, we have a great new act. He's a real find, there's no doubt that's a fact. He'll entertain you, he'll make you stare, and our great new act is seated over there!
MUM: I hope he's better than the last one.
DAD: Couldn't be much worse.
GIRL: Mum, Mum.
MUM: Shut up and eat your popcorn.
DOCTOR: Look, I insist in going on first.
MAGS: I told you, I am.
DOCTOR: I am!
DOCTOR: Join the club. Captain?
CAPTAIN: No thanks, old boy. I'll sit this one out. Goodbye, Mags.
MAGS: Bye, Captain.
CLOWN: That'll do. Take it back to the bus.
CLOWN: Let me entertain you.
WHIZZKID: Well, I have to say it's a real thrill for me to be here at the Psychic Circus. I've collected all your posters, you know.
RINGMASTER: Have you now?
WHIZZKID: From all your venues. And also I've got some very interesting
RINGMASTER : Oh Doctor, oh Doctor, have no fear. Calling the Doctor. There's no escape. Repeat, there is no escape.
MAGS: Won't they take no for an answer?
DOCTOR: No. Oh, we should have made straight away for the open air, I suppose.
MAGS: Look.
DOCTOR: How extraordinary. They're just like the stones in the Big Top. Fascinating. I wonder how long they've been here?
MAGS: Maybe they were always here.
DOCTOR: That thought had occurred to me. Let's investigate.
MAGS: Oh! Can you see it?
DOCTOR: See what?
MAGS: That moon sign.
DOCTOR: The moon? Why does it frighten you? Tell me.
MAGS: Don't ask. Just lets get out of here.
ACE: Pasty face.
CLOWN: Don't like clowns, eh? After some time in here, you'll tell me what I want to know.
ACE: Is any one there? Come on, you don't scare me.
MAGS: It's weird. I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Oh, nasty little booby trap, that. That is, if it is a booby trap. Still, there's certainly no way forward.
MAGS: Is it a well?
DOCTOR: One way to find out.
DOCTOR: That eye, I've seen it before. Of course, it was on the kites at the entrance hall. Fascinating. Somehow, somewhere down there is the answer to all that's going on at the Psychic Circus.
CAPTAIN: Ahem. Awfully sorry to butt in like this, old boy, but I'm afraid you're wanted. You're the next one due on in the ring.
Part Three
MAGS: Why did you bring them here?
CAPTAIN: Survival of the fittest, old girl. Don't tell me you never came across that on the planet Vulpana?
DOCTOR: But we were on the edge of discovering the secret of the Psychic Circus. Doesn't that interest you at all?
CAPTAIN: Frankly, no, old chap. Anyway, what's going on seems pretty clear to me. Anybody dumb enough to get into the ring gets killed.
ACE: Just because I said I don't like them, doesn't mean I'm scared of clowns, okay? Got that, tinhead? I said, got that, tinhead?
BELLBOY: Oh, I'm sorry. That shouldn't have happened. I must have fallen asleep.
ACE: We've met before. Don't you remember me?
CAPTAIN: Mags, now please. Not now. Not yet!
MUM: I don't think much of this, Father.
DAD: Nothing's happening, is it.
MUM: Not that I can see.
GIRL: Mum, Mum!
MUM: What is it?
GIRL: I'm bored.
DAD: There's no point in going on, dear. We're all bored. Something has to happen soon.
CAPTAIN: After all I've done for you, the Doctor gets away and you and I are going back to the guardroom.
MAGS: You were lucky.
CAPTAIN: Yes, I suppose you're right. I'm still in one piece. You would have given us the full works. Still, the old team of Mags and the Captain stuck together as usual. As a matter of fact, it reminded me of that time of Fagiros, when the Architrave of Batgeld was showing me his early collection of Ganglion pottery
DOCTOR: Of course, of course.
DOCTOR: Things are beginning to get out of control quicker than I expected.
DEADBEAT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Fun for all the family? I don't know how they've got the nerve.
BELLBOY: Oh, my Flowerchild. They murdered you with a robot I made.
ACE: You're sure that's what happened?
BELLBOY: There can be no doubt. Every robot, every clown in the circus I made and maintained, for this. And even now they won't let me die. They need me.
ACE: You mean you're the only one who knows how?
BELLBOY: Each of us, each of us in the circus, we all had one circus skill we learned, and mine was this.
ACE: This control unit's brill.
BELLBOY: Have it.
ACE: Really?
BELLBOY: Yes. It controls that, and the full scale version I made.
BELLBOY: Careful. That activates the laser eyes. It was to have been my masterpiece, but like everything else it was, it was abused and went wrong. We had such high ideals when we started. We shared everything and we enjoyed making people happy. If we had a problem we'd all just sit round and talk it through. Oh, we were so happy. At least, I think we were.
DOCTOR: Hello, Deadbeat. Fancy meeting you here. Small world, isn't it. It frightened you to see that eye, didn't it. It means the powers behind it are on the move again. Something happened to you here. You haven't always been like this. Did you try and find something out? Were you punished? Can you understand anything I'm saying? Well, there's one thing I do know, Deadbeat. You're not going to give me away to the others. Are you?
DEADBEAT: I wouldn't. I wouldn't.
DOCTOR: Lead on, Deadbeat.
DAD: You know, I could get quite cross about this.
WHIZZKID: Oh wow, is that Captain Cook, the famous intergalactic explorer and
CLOWN: Quiet. Where's the Doctor?
CAPTAIN: He gave us the slip.
CLOWN: He did what?
CAPTAIN: He gave us the slip. A similar thing happened to me in the Bay of Paranoia on Golobus.
CLOWN: I don't care what happened on Golobus.
CAPTAIN: Your loss, old boy. Anyway, it was all her fault.
MAGS: Hang on a minute.
CAPTAIN: I imagine you'll have to put her into the ring next as some sort of punishment.
CLOWN: No.
CAPTAIN: Oh, found someone else, have you?
CLOWN: Yes.
CAPTAIN: Really. May I enquire who?
CLOWN: You.
WHIZZKID: Excuse me, but you are Captain Cook the famous intergalactic explorer. I've got maps at home showing all your journeys and a piece of one of your old shoes I bought in a souvenir shop
CAPTAIN: Will you leave me alone!
RINGMASTER: Hey, hey, Morgana, Morgana. Hey, baby, you were long gone.
MORGANA: Look. It's here, now.
RINGMASTER: What do you mean?
MORGANA: What we found. What we serve. It'll always be here now, waiting for us to
RINGMASTER: Don't come with all that now.
MORGANA: Don't pretend you don't see it!
RINGMASTER: Look, I've got an empty circus tent in there right now. I don't want to talk about anything else.
MORGANA: Well, send in another act.
RINGMASTER: I will, baby, just as soon as I can.
CLOWN: The Doctor's escaped. Your idiot of a Captain failed us.
RINGMASTER: All right, send him in the ring.
CLOWN: It's arranged already, but I'm more worried about the Doctor. He's dangerous.
RINGMASTER: Well, let's go find him, then.
CLOWN: I'll go find him. You get back in the ring.
RINGMASTER: Hey, just a minute, man
MORGANA: Quiet, both of you! Look, it's showing him to us.
RINGMASTER: But he's with Deadbeat.
CLOWN: Then he must be stopped at once.
BELLBOY: Oh, the kites she made, beautiful kites, every colour of the rainbow. All different shapes and sizes. And they use them to watch us and trap us and keep us here. So they destroyed her work and then they destroyed her.
ACE: It'll be all right, Bellboy. I'll get you out of here.
BELLBOY: Why should I want to get out of here? It's gone. The fun, freedom of being what you want to be, all of it. Don't you understand?
ACE: Yes. Look, I'm sorry. We can't stay here forever, can we. I've got to find the Doctor for a start.
BELLBOY: They took everything that was bright and good about what we had, and buried it where it will never be found again.
ACE: I don't understand. Who's they?
BELLBOY: The ones who run the circus. The ones you've met. There wasn't just them, there was some. There was.
BELLBOY: Flowerchild and, and Peacepipe, and Juniperberry, and, and Deadbeat. No, he wasn't Deadbeat then, he was er, he was, he was. It's gone.
ACE: They're coming to take me to the ring, Bellboy. They may need you to repair the robots, but I'm just trouble. Making a bit of a mess of opening the door, aren't they? It can't be that difficult.
BELLBOY: Oh, maybe, maybe it is the end after all.
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Deadbeat, I take it all back.  You're absolutely right. Clowns can be creepy.
DEADBEAT: Sift the dreams in your mind.
BELLBOY: King.
DEADBEAT: You'll be amazed
BELLBOY: Kingpin! That was your name. Kingpin.
CAPTAIN: So you've always been interested in the Psychic Circus, have you? Sit down.
WHIZZKID: Oh yes, of course.
CAPTAIN: Ah.
WHIZZKID: I've never been able to visit it before now, but I've got all sorts of souvenirs. Copies of all the advertising satellites that have ever been sent out. All the posters. I had a long correspondence with one of the founder members too, soon after it started. Although I never got to see the early days, I know it's not as good as it used to be but I'm still terribly interested.
RINGMASTER: Two minutes, Captain.
CAPTAIN: Thank you, Ringmaster. No doubt you dream of having the ultimate Psychic Circus experience as soon as possible.
WHIZZKID: Sorry?
CAPTAIN: You ache for the moment when you can do your own act within that sawdust covered magic circle.
WHIZZKID: Oh, yes, of course. I mean, there's no real danger, is there, really.
CAPTAIN: Only for those without resource or imagination or panache. I'm sure you have all those qualities.
WHIZZKID: Well, I really don't know.
CAPTAIN: Come, come, dear boy, don't be so absurdly modest.
MAGS: Don't listen to him.
WHIZZKID: But this is one of my heroes, Captain Cook, the intergalactic space explorer.
CAPTAIN: Exactly. And shall I tell you what I'm prepared to do for you as a special favour?
WHIZZKID: What?
CAPTAIN: Postpone my brief moment of glory in the ring so that you may enjoy the unforgettable experience before me, far beyond the bouncing Upas trees of Boromeo or the singing squids of Anagonia.
WHIZZKID: Are you sure you can bear to let me go in first?
CAPTAIN: It is a sacrifice I am prepared to make.
DEADBEAT: The dreams. Sift the dreams. When the mind's divided the body screams.
BELLBOY: Yes, some of it's coming back now. Not all of it. He was Kingpin. He was the one who persuaded us to come here. There was something he wanted, something he knew about. And we all trusted him, and
DOCTOR: Something went wrong?
BELLBOY: Yes. Something went very wrong. It's this place, you see. It does things to you.
DOCTOR: And a friendly hippy circus was turned into a trap for killing people.
BELLBOY: Yes. Even our own kind. That was after Kingpin was no longer Kingpin. Something went. Something went with him and
DOCTOR: And the well?
BELLBOY: What well?
DOCTOR: You don't know anything about a well with an eye peering out from inside?
BELLBOY: No.
ACE: An eye, like the one of Flowerchild's, like the ones on the kites.
BELLBOY: No, not any more.
DEADBEAT: Don't look in the well. The eye gives you promises of heaven or hell.
ACE: He's off, he's gone. I knew people like him in Perivale.
DOCTOR: Listen, Ace.
ACE: What to?
DOCTOR: The answers. You know what happened, don't you, Deadbeat?
MUM: At last.
RINGMASTER: Now welcome, folks. I'm sure you'd like to know we've got a brand new act for your circus show. Now welcome please with all the warmth you can, the Psychic Circus' greatest fan!
WHIZZKID: This is the most exciting day of my life. My dream come true. I'm standing in the ring of the Psychic Circus.
MAGS: You've sent that poor boy out to his death.
CAPTAIN: Nonsense. He may be a great success.
CAPTAIN: So it just goes to show you never can be certain.
CAPTAIN: As I said, survival of the fittest.
DOCTOR: Deadbeat, if we take you to the well, can you show us what it did?
ACE: How do you know it's not all a con, Professor?
DOCTOR: Well, he brought me here to you and Bellboy. He must have done that for a purpose.
ACE: Not if your brains are that scrambled.
DOCTOR: Ah, now there's something there, Ace. I saw it when he looked into the crystal ball.
ACE: You're just an aging hippy, Professor.
DOCTOR: There might be something in that, yes. Anyway, we'd better be going. Bellboy?
BELLBOY: Er, no.
ACE: Come on, Bellboy.
BELLBOY: No, I think the chief clown will be here after you and I could delay him for a while. I'd be pleased to make myself useful.
ACE: But Bellboy?
BELLBOY: You still don't understand, do you. Everything I loved has gone. There's no point in living on to do work I hate.
DOCTOR: So be it, then, Bellboy. Come on, Deadbeat. Or should I call you Kingpin? We've got work to do.
ACE: Bye now, Bellboy. All the best. Oh, and er, thanks for this.
BELLBOY: Bye, Ace. Goodbye, Kingpin, Doctor.
MORGANA: The acts will keep on coming now, we promise, and no one will ever go near the bus again. Those who remain are your servants to do with as you wish. No, I never wanted to resist your power.
CLOWN: Where are they?
BELLBOY: I don't know. I don't care. It's all destroyed, you know that. Oh, you were a wonderful clown once. Funny, inventive.
CLOWN: Quiet.
BELLBOY: I'm not helping you any more, you see.
CLOWN: Take care, Bellboy.
BELLBOY: Come on. Come on. Deal with me as you dealt with Flowerchild.
CLOWN: You're crazy.
BELLBOY: Come on. Come on! Come on!
DEADBEAT: No. I can't do it.
ACE: Come on, Kingpin. Nearly there. Hold on, please.
DOCTOR: Now, Kingpin, show us what you did when you first saw the eye.
ACE: Great stuff, Kingpin.
DOCTOR: He must have used that medallion to summon the powers that lurk here.
ACE: And it did this to him.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: I wish I had some Nitro Nine to lob down there. Hang about. The mirror here, it's an eye.
DOCTOR: Yes, that eye seems to plague us everywhere, only with the eyeball removed by someone or something.
ACE: And hidden.
DOCTOR: In the bus.
ACE: Where Flowerchild died trying to get it.
DEADBEAT: Shall be free. We shall be free. We shall be free. We shall be free.
CAPTAIN: Calm down, Mags. There'll be some more contestants along soon. We're doing very well.
MAGS: That poor boy.
CAPTAIN: Us or him, Mags. And before you get too high and mighty, remember where you'd be without me. Dead with a bullet in you on the planet Vulpana. A silver bullet.
MAGS: I know that, Captain, but you didn't do it for me, you did it for yourself. I only wish I knew what you were after.
CAPTAIN: All in good time, Mags. All in good time.
DOCTOR: It's so tantalising. I'm so close to understanding it all and yet so far.
ACE: So we'll have to get hold of that other bit of mirror.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Now, you take Kingpin back to the bus and find it, but be careful.
ACE: Hang on a bit, Professor. This is all going a bit too fast for me. I'll fetch it, no problem, but what about you?
DOCTOR: I'm going back to the ring.
ACE: Are you off your head?
DOCTOR: The Psychic Circus needs acts. If they've got me then perhaps they won't worry about you two for the moment.
ACE: Sometimes I think it's you that's crazy, not Deadbeat here.
DOCTOR: Anybody remotely interesting is mad in someway or another.
DAD: I don't know where they find these acts, do you, Mother?
MUM: Never seem to get any better, do they, Father?
DOCTOR: I believe you've been looking for me. I'm wanted backstage.
DOCTOR: Greetings, Captain Cook. Mags. You will be pleased to hear that the greatest act in the galaxy has returned to the fold.
CAPTAIN: Jolly good show, Doctor.
MAGS: But Doctor, I helped you to escape.
DOCTOR: I know, Mags, and I haven't wasted the time you bought me. And I have returned with an idea. I suggest that this time we all three work together.
MAGS: Meaning?
DOCTOR: Up to now all the people in the cage have been played off against each other, and of course some people are cleverer at preserving themselves than others.
CAPTAIN: Luck of the draw, old boy.
DOCTOR: Not entirely. What I'm proposing is that we all three go into the ring. Three for one and one for three. That should throw a very big hammer into the works.
MAGS: I'm with you, Doctor. And so's he.
CAPTAIN: Now just a moment, Mags.
MAGS: Aren't you, Captain.
RINGMASTER: Now welcome, folks, not one act but three, to the Greatest Show in the Galaxy, the Galaxy, the Galaxy.
CAPTAIN: Sorry, everyone. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, but before we start I would like to make one small request from stage management. A special lighting effect.
MAGS: No.
CAPTAIN: Could you perhaps give us that old devil moon effect.
MAGS: No! No!
CAPTAIN: You really were extremely stupid this time, Doctor. I told you she was an unusual specimen. The growling, the snarling, reaction to the moon. Surely you should have guessed?
Part Four
RINGMASTER: Captain!
CAPTAIN: I hate it when this happens. She can't control herself, of course, and like all her kind she'll destroy whatever comes in her path. Which, I'm afraid, in this case has to be you.
CAPTAIN: This circus is only the half of it, you see, old chap. These hippy fellows weren't quite so dumb as they look. Did you come here just for the fun of it? Well, some of them did, but they're all dead.
CONDUCTOR: Could I see your tickets, please.
CAPTAIN: We experienced explorers know all about making the most of our discoveries. The powers here can be harnessed by those intrepid enough to grasp the opportunities. Myself, for instance.
DOCTOR: Those powers destroyed Deadbeat.
CAPTAIN: Yes, but he was like you, Doctor, none too bright in the old self-interest stakes.
CAPTAIN: Stop it, Mags. This werewolf is extremely dangerous.
DOCTOR: You're meddling with things you don't understand.
CAPTAIN: No, Doctor, you are. Once you're out of the way, I shall make my deal with the powers that be, whoever they may be.
MORGANA: She's taking Deadbeat to the bus.
CLOWN: In that case, they're also taken care of.
CAPTAIN: I remember once visiting the gold mines of Katakiki
DOCTOR: Captain Cook!
CAPTAIN: What?
DOCTOR: You're not only a scoundrel and a meddling fool, but you're also a crushing bore.
CAPTAIN: I'm afraid you've really done it this time, old boy. Mags!
DEADBEAT: Search, search, search for the truth. Search it out, search it now.
ACE: This must be it.
DEADBEAT: Search it now.
ACE: Kingpin, I've found it!
DOCTOR: Mags! Mags! Do you hear me? Mags!
DOCTOR: Mags, when you're like this, this isn't in your nature, you have to destroy everything that crosses your path. I don't believe that. Mags!
DOCTOR: Mags! Mags! Wait, wait. I need your mercy, but you don't have to kill.
CAPTAIN: Come on, Mags. You can trust me. You know that, don't you? Once he's out of the way we can split the proceeds. Do it for me, do it for your old pal the Captain. You know you'll enjoy it. I order you to. I order you to!
DOCTOR: No, Mags! No!
DEADBEAT: Search, search, search for the truth. Search, search, search
ACE: You've got to try and help me, Kingpin. I can't get it open.
DEADBEAT: Search, search, search for the truth.
ACE: What I'd give for my chemistry set now.
DEADBEAT: Search, search, search for the truth.
ACE: Come on, Kingpin. Do try and concentrate a bit.
CONDUCTOR: Tickets, please. Tickets, please.
CONDUCTOR: Tickets, please.
CONDUCTOR: Tickets, please.
ACE: Kingpin! Please!
ACE: Kingpin, do something!
DEADBEAT: I remember now! It's beneath the cap.
ACE: What?
DEADBEAT: Knock its cap off!
ACE: Now what?
DEADBEAT: Bellboy put a button that said Request Stop. Press it!
ACE: What?
DEADBEAT: Press the button!
DEADBEAT: Now stand back.
ACE: What?
DEADBEAT: Stand back, quick.
DEADBEAT: No! Get away! Quick!
ACE: Now we're getting somewhere. You really are Kingpin, aren't you.
DEADBEAT: Yes, thankfully. But no one's safe until we get this  back to the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on, Mags. We've got to run away, now.
DAD: We want more.
DOCTOR: Mags!
RINGMASTER: Er, another act's coming soon, folks. You can believe me.
GIRL: Another act now.
DAD: We want more.
MUM:  We need more.
MORGANA: You haven't played fair with me.
RINGMASTER: Listen, we've done everything we're supposed to do, right?
MORGANA: I had my doubts, but I came through in the end.
RINGMASTER: There are going to be other visitors.
GIRL: We need more.
DAD: You have no one left to give.
MUM: Except yourselves.
RINGMASTER: No!
MORGANA: Please, more acts are on the way, I promise you.
DOCTOR: Something dreadful's happening in the ring. Things are getting out of control quicker than I expected.
DAD : Calling the Doctor. Calling the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Nothing will satisfy them but my presence.
MAGS: I'm coming back in there with you.
DOCTOR: No. You must run and get Ace and Deadbeat.
DOCTOR: I must prepare for my entrance. Never keep your audience waiting.
DOCTOR: I'm coming. Open a pathway for me. Once small step for mankind, one great leap, or words to that effect.
DOCTOR: And here we all are at last. I'm surprised you brought me here. It must be very difficult for you, trying to exist concurrently in two different time spaces. I know the problem myself. No wonder those memorial stones looked familiar. The Gods of Ragnarok, I presume.
STALLHOLDER: Don't you frighten my horse like that, you hippie weirdo.
STALLHOLDER: Shut up, circus riff-raff. You don't own this planet, you know.
DOCTOR: How many people have you destroyed, I wonder, before Kingpin was lured down here. Poor Kingpin. That's what you like, isn't it. Taking someone with a touch of individuality and imagination, and wearing them down to nothingness in your service.
DAD: Enough.
MUM: You have said enough.
DOCTOR: Enough? I've hardly started. I have fought the Gods of Ragnarok all through time.
DAD: You are in our true time space now, Doctor. There is no appeal beyond its confines to any other.
DOCTOR: Don't tell me what you want me to do. Let me guess. Now let me see. You want me to
DAD: Entertain us.
MUM: Entertain us.
DAD: Or die. So long as you entertain us, you may live.
MUM: When you no longer entertain us, you die.
DOCTOR: Predictable as ever, Gods of Ragnarok. As I think it's been said before, or was it after? Anyway, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
ACE: Hey, Mags! Where's the Doctor?
MAGS: Back at the circus.
ACE: So you're on your own now?
MAGS: Not exactly. Look.
MAGS: That's what they're after.
DEADBEAT: Oh, I might have guessed.
ACE: So how do we get it back to the Doctor? Oh, dumbo! Not you two, me. I've got an idea. Come on!
MAGS: Wrong way!
ACE: Not for this. Come on, Kingpin!
DOCTOR: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, for that overwhelming reception. And now, I would like to begin like life, at the beginning. But how did life begin? Was it with a chicken or was it with
DAD: What?
MUM: Don't try our patience.
DAD: Don't play games.
DOCTOR: You're not interested in beginnings. You're only interested in endings.
MAGS: Oh no, not that thing again. Come on.
DEADBEAT: Dumbo. Bellboy's robot.
ACE: Dead right, Kingpin.
CLOWN: Bellboy's greatest mistake. What a place to choose. You may have the Eye again, Deadbeat, but you won't use it. You know that. You're not strong enough! You weren't before.
DEADBEAT: At least I tried. You just gave in.
CLOWN: Yes, and I shall get my reward. Last chance, Deadbeat. We really believed in all that talk of peace and love
ACE: This thing had better work, or I'll kick its head in.
MAGS: For a moment I thought you weren't going to be able to make it stop.
ACE: Funny you should say that.
DEADBEAT: He used to be a great clown.
ACE: I've never liked clowns.
DOCTOR: What, no complaints? No arguments? No thunderbolts?
DAD: No, Doctor.
MUM: We're not concerned that you're playing for time.
DAD: We have a saying.
DOCTOR: Let me guess. Give yourself enough rope and you hang yourself.
ACE: Kingpin.
DEADBEAT: I only hope we make it in time. The Doctor's stronger than I ever was, but even he can't hold out against them forever.
ACE: He'll have a good stab at it, though.
DAD: You are nearing the end, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A piece of rope has two ends, Father Ragnarok.
MUM: Feel the rain, Doctor.
DAD: Feel the chill in your bones.
DEADBEAT: Ace, quick! Come on!
DAD: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes?
DAD: You are trifling with us.
DOCTOR: Really? I thought I was entertaining you.
DAD: You are on the brink of destruction, Doctor. We want something bigger, something better.
DOCTOR: Do you now?
ACE: The Doctor must be here somewhere.
DEADBEAT: Well, he may already be in the Dark Circus with the Gods. If so, there's only one way we can reach him.
MAGS: The stone chamber.
ACE: And the medallion?
DEADBEAT: Yeah. We must be careful. They're bound to sense its presence.
DOCTOR: Do I have your full attention?
DEADBEAT: You do realise that they'll try anything to stop us?
ACE: Yes. Let's go.
DOCTOR: The climax of my act, Gods of Ragnarok, requires something you do not possess in great abundance. That is, imagination. And it starts with a piece of metal. This piece of metal once belonged to a sword, and that sword belonged to a gladiator.
DOCTOR: And that gladiator fought and died in this ring to entertain you.
ACE: Go for it, Kingpin.
MAGS: Kingpin, please.
ACE: Well, one of us had better try.
CAPTAIN: Perhaps I might relieve you of that.
MAGS: Captain, I thought you were dead.
CAPTAIN: I am, my dear. I am.
DOCTOR: I have fed you enough, Gods of Ragnarok, and you found what I have to offer indigestible. So I have taken myself off the menu. La comedia e finita.
DAD: We command you.
MUM: You cannot stop.
DOCTOR: I already have.
DAD: Then you will die.
DOCTOR: Probably not. It's all a matter of timing, don't you know.
ACE: Oi, sarcophagus face!
DEADBEAT: Quick.
CAPTAIN: You know, when I was on the planet Periboea, I met someone who walks around when he was already dead. I must say, as an experience I'd say it was very overrated.
DEADBEAT: Look. Get down!
STALLHOLDER: It's what I've always said. No consideration for those of us that live here.
DOCTOR: Enjoying the show, Ace?
ACE: Yeah. It was your show all along, wasn't it?
MAGS: The Captain really is finished now, isn't he?
DOCTOR: Yes. But you're just about to start.
DEADBEAT: Doctor, I've been thinking.
DOCTOR: What better way for a circus to begin than with a wonderful new act.
ACE: Yeah, weird and wonderful. Nice one, Professor. You'll knock them dead.
MAGS: That's just what I'm afraid of. What if I can't control it?
DOCTOR: Oh, you can, Mags. You already have.
DEADBEAT: What about it, Doctor? You and Ace. Join Kingpin's new circus and travel the galaxy with us.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Kingpin, but I'm afraid we've got other galaxies to travel. And besides, I find circuses a little sinister.
