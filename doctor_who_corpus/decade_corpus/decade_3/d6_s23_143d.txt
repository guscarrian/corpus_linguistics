The Ultimate Foe
Part Thirteen
KEEPER: I came as soon as I could, my lady.
INQUISITOR: Thank you, Keeper. Doctor, do you have any further evidence in your defence?
VALEYARD: My lady, with all due respect, have we not seen enough? Are you not forgetting Article seven and the irrefutable charge which faces the Doctor, that of genocide?
INQUISITOR: I shall deal with that charge in due course, Valeyard. Now kindly don't interrupt me again. Doctor, do you have any further evidence in your defence?
DOCTOR: No, my lady, but I would point out that much of the Railyard's so-called evidence was a farrago of distortion which would have had Ananias, Baron Munchhausen and every other famous liar blushing down to their very toe nails. Much of the evidence was not as I remembered.
INQUISITOR: Do you still maintain the Matrix has been tampered with?
DOCTOR: Yes, madam, I do. All I do not yet understand is who did it and why.
INQUISITOR: Your accusation would be laughable if it were not so outrageous. However, as you see, I have summoned the Keeper of the Matrix. Keeper?
KEEPER: My lady.
INQUISITOR: You have heard the Doctor's allegations. Is it at all possible for the data stored within the Matrix to be tampered with in any way?
KEEPER: Quite impossible, my lady. No one may enter the Matrix without the Key of Rassilon.
INQUISITOR: Doctor, if you were not already facing the most serious charges, such an accusation levelled at a senior prosecutor would bring you into contempt.
MEL : What's going on? Let me out of here!
GLITZ: Dibber? What's happened to your voice, lad?
MEL: I'm not Dibber. Neither am I a lad. And what's more, there's nothing wrong with my voice. As a matter of total disinterest, who are you?
GLITZ: Oh, Sabalom Glitz. And you?
MEL: Melanie, known as Mel.
GLITZ: Are they all like you here?
MEL: I don't know. Shall we go and find out?
INQUISITOR: There is only one to rebut the evidence of the Matrix, Doctor, and that is to produce witnesses who can support your version of events. Can you do that?
DOCTOR: Well, of course I can't. You know I can't.
INQUISITOR: Then we must accept the Valeyard's evidence.
DOCTOR: Any witnesses I might produce are scattered all over the universe and all through time. How can I find them now?
VALEYARD: Procrastination, my lady. The Doctor' only
DOCTOR: Melanie? Glitz? What are you doing here?
GLITZ: I was sent, wasn't I. Not my idea, mind.
MEL: Same here. What have you been up to?
INQUISITOR: Be silent. Who sent you?
GLITZ: That's the beak, is it? They all look the same, don't they? Carved out of something hard and nasty.
INQUISITOR: You said you were sent here, Sabalom Glitz. By whom?
MASTER : By me, madam.
DOCTOR: Oh no! Now I really am finished.
MEL: Who's that?
DOCTOR: Just one of my oldest enemies.
INQUISITOR: This is entirely irregular. Who are you, sir?
MASTER : I'm known as the Master, and as you see, I speak to you from within the Matrix. Proof, if any be needed, that not only qualified people can enter here.
KEEPER: But you haven't the Key of Rassilon.
MASTER : I got a very good copy, Keeper, just as the Doctor said was possible.
INQUISITOR: This is an independent inquiry appointed by the High Council to investigate serious charges
MASTER : Madam, I know. I've followed the trial with great interest and indeed amusement, but now I must intervene for the sake of justice.
DOCTOR: Justice? Pay no attention, madam. He has no concept of what justice is. He'd see me dead tomorrow.
MASTER : Gladly, Doctor, but I'm not prepared to countenance a rival.
VALEYARD: My lady, I must propose an immediate adjournment.
INQUISITOR: I'm sorry, Valeyard. The evidence for the prosecution is completed. The ball, as the Doctor might say, is out of your court.
MASTER : Doctor, I've sent you two star witnesses. I knew you'd need them.
VALEYARD: With due respect, Sagacity, the matter of witnesses is for you to decide. We've seen enough to know that Glitz is an admitted criminal. Any testimony from him must therefore be dubious in the extreme.
MEL: But not from me. I'm as truthful, honest, and about as boring as they come.
INQUISITOR: This court is not, for the moment, impugning your integrity, young lady.
MASTER : Let Sabalom Glitz speak.
INQUISITOR: Criminals have been known to speak the truth, Valeyard, especially when their own interests are not at stake.
VALEYARD: My point, my lady, is that this person who calls himself the Master, whoever he might be, should not be permitted to produce surprise witnesses.
MASTER : You pretend not to know me, do you? I'm surprised by the shortness of the Valeyard's memory.
INQUISITOR: The Doctor may, in his defence, call witnesses to rebut your evidence, after which you may cross-examine them. That is the procedure, Valeyard.
VALEYARD: My lady.
MASTER : If I might intercede?
INQUISITOR: You have no part in these proceedings, sir.
MASTER : Corporeally, of course not, but I'm present, and enjoying myself enormously.
INQUISITOR: Doctor, please examine your witnesses.
DOCTOR: Yes, madam.
GLITZ: This is real machonite, you know. Worth a few grotzits today, Your Honour.
DOCTOR: Glitz.
GLITZ: I could make you a fair offer on a job lot, do you a very good deal.
DOCTOR: Glitz!
GLITZ: What?
DOCTOR: You were sent here by the Master.
GLITZ: Yeah, well, he's a business partner, so to speak. We've had a few nice little tickles together
DOCTOR: This court is not interested in your sordid business deals, Glitz.
INQUISITOR: Very good, Doctor. Keep him to the point.
DOCTOR: When we last met, you expressed interest in a box.
GLITZ: Right.
DOCTOR: What was in that box?
GLITZ: I don't know. Scientific stuff, so he said. Stuff the Sleepers have been nicking from the Matrix for years.
KEEPER: The Matrix? My Matrix?
GLITZ: Right. Well, it seems the Sleepers had found a way to break into the Matrix, and they were creaming off all this high-tech info to take back to Andromeda.
DOCTOR: But they were operating from Earth.
GLITZ: Of course. That was their cover, wasn't it. They knew that the Time Lords eventually would trace the leak.
VALEYARD: He's lying, my lady.
DOCTOR: I don't think so, Stackyard. It all begins to make very good sense.
MEL: That's it, Doc. Now we're getting at the dirt.
DOCTOR: Doc? Carry on, Glitz. What happened next?
GLITZ: Well, eventually the Time Lords did suss out the leak, so they wanted to wipe out all the Sleepers, and they used this er, magno. Magno
DOCTOR: Magnotron?
GLITZ: That's it.
DOCTOR: Well, that can only be done by an order in High Council.
MASTER : Of course, Doctor. To protect their own secrets, they drew the Earth and its constellation billions of miles across space
DOCTOR: Causing the fireball which nearly destroyed the planet.
MASTER : Of little consequence in the High Council's planning. The robot recovery mission from Andromeda sped past Earth out into space. Gallifreyan secrets were saved, except that at the first intimation of the coming fireball, the Andromedans were able to set up a survival chamber for the Sleepers.
DOCTOR: So that's why Earth was renamed Ravalox. That sanctimonious gang of hypocrites were covering their tracks.
MASTER : Exactly. It takes time, Doctor, but eventually you get there.
DOCTOR: They put an ancient culture like the Earth to the sword for the sake of a few miserable, filthy scientific advances?
GLITZ: Big market for them, Doctor, so he said. Worth a lot of grotzits.
DOCTOR: In all my travellings throughout the universe I have battled against evil, against power-mad conspirators. I should have stayed here. The oldest civilisation, decadent, degenerate and rotten to the core. Ha! Power-mad conspirators, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen, they're still in the nursery compared to us. Ten million years of absolute power, that's what it takes to be really corrupt.
MEL: Take it easy, Doc.
INQUISITOR: Doctor, these unseemly outbursts
DOCTOR: Unseemly outbursts? If I hadn't visited Ravalox, as I then thought of it, the High Council would have kept this outrage carefully buried, as presumably they have for several centuries.
MASTER : I must agree. You have an endearing habit of blundering into these things, Doctor, and the High Council took full advantage of your blunder.
INQUISITOR: Explain that.
MASTER : They made a deal with the Valeyard, or as I've always known him, the Doctor, to adjust the evidence, in return for which he was promised the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations.
VALEYARD: This is clearly
DOCTOR: Just a minute! Did you call him the Doctor?
MASTER : There is some evil in all of us, Doctor, even you. The Valeyard is an amalgamation of the darker sides of your nature, somewhere between your twelfth and final incarnation. And I may say, you do not improve with age.
DOCTOR: Madam, this revelation should halt this trial immediately. Surely even Gallifreyan law must acknowledge that the same person cannot be both prosecutor and defendant.
INQUISITOR: The single purpose of this trial is to determine the defendant's guilt or otherwise on the basis of the evidence that has been presented. Anything else is, for the moment, irrelevant.
DOCTOR: What?
MEL: Doctor!
INQUISITOR: Valeyard!
DOCTOR: Glitz, come on!
GLITZ: What?
DOCTOR: We need him.
GLITZ: But he hasn't had time.
DOCTOR: There must be another way out of here.
GLITZ: He's gone!
KEEPER: The seventh door. He must have had a key.
DOCTOR: What?
KEEPER: The seventh entrance to the Matrix.
DOCTOR: Well, quickly, man, open it. He must be brought back.
INQUISITOR: I agree.
KEEPER: You'll never find him. The Matrix is a micro-universe.
MEL: Don't go, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I must. Perhaps nothing in my life has ever been so important. Come on, Glitz.
GLITZ: Me?
MEL: Doctor!
INQUISITOR: Be silent! Come, let us return to the trial room.
MEL: Why? There's nobody to try anymore.
INQUISITOR: Come along, both of you.
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, what an unpleasant journey. What an unpleasant place.
VALEYARD : Doctor.
DOCTOR: Glitz? Glitz?
VALEYARD : Bwahahahahahaha!
CHILDREN : London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down. London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady.
VALEYARD : Bwahahahahahaha!
DOCTOR: Well, I can't believe you're in there.
DOCTOR: Glitz! Help!
DOCTOR: Glitz!
GLITZ: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hurry, man!
GLITZ: What's going on?
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I don't know whether what just happened to me was real or an illusion.
GLITZ: Looks like someone's had a go at you.
DOCTOR: Do you mind?
GLITZ: What?
DOCTOR: Water.
GLITZ: Oh, yeah, sure.
DOCTOR: We're not in the real world any longer, Sabalom Glitz. Whatever attacked me was in that barrel.
GLITZ: Argh.
DOCTOR: Or was it in my mind?
GLITZ: How can we be in a different world? We just stepped through a door, that's all.
DOCTOR: Into the Matrix, where the only logic is that there isn't any logic.
GLITZ: Yeah, I knew this was a mistake. My grip on reality's not too good at the best of times. Here, this is for you.
GLITZ: Now, if you don't mind telling me, how do I get out of here?
DOCTOR: It's from the Master.
GLITZ: I know. I've just given it to you. He said it would be useful.
DOCTOR: It tells me where the Valeyard has his base.
GLITZ:  The Fantasy Factory, proprietor J J Chambers.
DOCTOR: So that's where he got to.
DOCTOR: So why is the Master helping me?
GLITZ: Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll find out. I'm off.
DOCTOR: No, come on. I want you to meet my darker side.
GLITZ: I've done my bit.
DOCTOR: Pop in and say hello. You'll be perfectly safe.
GLITZ: What's going on?
INQUISITOR: Assuming I accept what you say about the evidence against the Doctor, how much of it had been contrived?
MASTER : For a lie to work, madam, it must be shrouded in truth. Therefore most of what you saw was true.
INQUISITOR: Then the young woman, the one who died, was that true?
MASTER : Ah, the delightful Miss Perpugilliam Brown. That was clever of the Valeyard, exploiting the affection the Doctor had for her. But then, of course, the Valeyard would know precisely how the Doctor felt.
INQUISITOR: Then she lives?
MASTER : As a queen, set up on high by that warmongering fool Yrcanos.
INQUISITOR: I am pleased.
MASTER : Sentiment will not keep the Doctor alive, my lady.
MEL: Isn't there anything we can do to help?
MASTER : Remain calm. Concentrate your thoughts. Prepare for the worst.
KEEPER: Huh. Sounds a bit gloomy.
MASTER : You have any other suggestions, my dear Keeper?
INQUISITOR: Assuming I accept what you say about the evidence against the Doctor, how much of it had been contrived?
DOCTOR: You'll catch cold lying there.
GLITZ: You're a hard man, Doctor. I could have been killed.
DOCTOR: Not when you're wearing a mark seven postidion life preserver.
GLITZ: Yeah, well, whoever threw that harpoon didn't know that. So much for illusions. Anyway, I thought it was you he was trying to kill.
DOCTOR: Yes, he's playing games. He wants to humiliate me first.
GLITZ: Oh, I see. He humiliates you by throwing harpoons at me. It makes a lot of sense.
DOCTOR: Your presence here makes his task more difficult. He knows that. He also knows that together we can fight him.
GLITZ: Look, Doctor, I'm a small-time crook with small-time ambitions, one of which is to stay alive. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish you every good luck, but I'm on my way. I've done my bit.
DOCTOR: If you leave and I die, what future do you think you'll have? As the only witness to events here, the Valeyard will be forced to seek you out and kill you.
GLITZ: All right, I'll help you.
DOCTOR: Good man. Now, button your life preserver and let's get on with it.
INQUISITOR: In all my experience, I have never before had to conclude a case in both the absence of the accused and the prosecutor.
MASTER : One and the same person, madam.
INQUISITOR: So you've said, but can you prove that?
MASTER : I know them both. But I suggest you question the High Council. They set up this travesty of a trial, making a scapegoat of the Doctor to conceal their own involvement.
INQUISITOR: Is there any reason why I should accept that allegation from a renegade Time Lord?
MASTER : Yes, if you're concerned with learning the truth.
INQUISITOR: What is your interest in this matter? Not, I think, concern for the Doctor.
MASTER : Oh, indeed not. The Doctor's well matched against himself. One must destroy the other.
MEL: How utterly evil.
MASTER : Thank you. I think I'd lay a shade more odds on the Valeyard, though the possibility of their mutual destruction must exist. That would be perfect.
MEL: You're despicable.
MASTER : So many compliments. May I say, you're a charming child.
MEL: You beast.
INQUISITOR: Be quiet, girl. Am I to take it that some base desire for revenge is your motive for interfering?
MASTER : There's nothing purer and more unsullied, madam, than the desire for revenge. But, if you follow the metaphor, I've thrown a pebble into the water, perhaps killing two birds with one stone, and causing ripples that'll rock the High Council to its foundations. What more could a renegade wish for?
DOCTOR: How do you do? I think we're expected.
GLITZ: Are you sure we're in the right place?
POPPLEWICK: Yes?
DOCTOR: We'd like to see the proprietor, please.
POPPLEWICK: Do you have an appointment, sir? Mister Chambers only sees people by appointment. Most particular about appointments is our Mister Chambers.
DOCTOR: I think you'll find we're expected.
POPPLEWICK: What is your name, sir?
DOCTOR: I am known as the Doctor, and this is Mister Sabalom Glitz.
GLITZ: If this Valeyard wants you dead, he's got a funny way of going about it.
DOCTOR: I've told you. It's called humiliation. Could you hurry up, please? We haven't got all day.
POPPLEWICK: There are procedures to follow, sir. Necessary routines to be completed. Even when I've found your names, there are many forms to be inscribed before you may move on to the next stage of processing. Processing is very important in this establishment. I'm sure that even you will understand that such things cannot be rushed, sir.
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. I've always been a bit of an iconoclast by nature.
POPPLEWICK: You can't go in there, not without an appointment!
POPPLEWICK: Ah, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, at least you're expecting us.
POPPLEWICK: We all are.
GLITZ: You're lookalike out there wasn't.
POPPLEWICK: He is the exception. The very junior Mister Popplewick isn't permitted to expect anyone.
GLITZ: What's he talking about?
DOCTOR: I think it's called bureaucracy.
POPPLEWICK: I prefer to call it order, and the holy writ of order is procedure. I'm sure you agree.
GLITZ: Oh, yeah, of course.
POPPLEWICK: For example, you wish to see the proprietor. Now, the correct procedure is to make an appointment.
DOCTOR: But we're already expected.
POPPLEWICK: But the junior Mister Popplewick isn't allowed to expect anyone.
GLITZ: You knew we were coming. Why didn't you give him the nod?
POPPLEWICK: And upset the procedure? The junior Mister Popplewick has his pride too.
GLITZ: I don't understand any of this. Here we are, waiting to duck a terminal knuckle sandwich, and all this screeve's going on about is whether we've got an appointment or not.
DOCTOR: Is there no way to expedite the procedure?
POPPLEWICK: Expedite? I am a senior clerk, sir. To me, the procedure is sacrosanct. My work is a celebration of all that is perfect. Why speed perfection?
DOCTOR: Because your employer wants me dead.
POPPLEWICK: You seem to have found the one little weakness in our procedure, sir. Would you sign this?
DOCTOR: What is it?
POPPLEWICK: A consent form, sir. The corridors in this factory are very long and dark. Should you unexpectedly die, our blessed proprietor, Mister J J Chambers, insists he inherits your remaining lives.
DOCTOR: Obviously the Valeyard doesn't trust the High Council to honour their side of the bargain.
GLITZ: Sign that and you're a dead man.
DOCTOR: We're in the Valeyard's domain. He can try and kill me any time he likes. I'll sign my remaining lives away to Mister J J Chambers.
GLITZ: Are you sure about this?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Now can we see your proprietor?
POPPLEWICK: The waiting room is through there. You will be summoned as soon as your signature has been verified.
GLITZ: This is madness.
DOCTOR: Not if it precipitates my meeting with the Valeyard.
DOCTOR: This is a very odd waiting room. Where are the hopelessly out of date magazines.
DOCTOR: Hmm? Glitz? Glitz?
VOICE : Bwahahahahahaha!
DOCTOR: What have you done with him?
VALEYARD : Look to your own predicament, Doctor.
DOCTOR: This is an illusion. I deny it!
VALEYARD : Not this time.
DOCTOR: This isn't happening!
VALEYARD : You are dead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No!
VALEYARD : Goodbye, Doctor. Bwahahahahahaha!
Part Fourteen
GLITZ: Doctor! Hang on! Where are you? Oh, no. Don't give in! I'm coming!
GLITZ: Doctor.
GLITZ: What a way to go. All in all, he wasn't a bad old codger. Honest, of course. Still, nobody's perfect.
DOCTOR :  And that's the clue. Nobody is. Not even the Valeyard.
GLITZ: Oh, great cosmic protector of grafters and dissemblers, save me. Save me! A voice from the grave.
DOCTOR : No, a grave voice.
DOCTOR: Bad joke. But everything round here is a bad joke.
GLITZ: No mud? But I saw. Your ankle armour.
GLITZ: I don't get it.
DOCTOR: Oh, do concentrate, Glitz. How often must I tell you? We're not dealing with reality.
VALEYARD: Why waste your breath on that simple minded oaf.
VALEYARD: You cannot speak as though reality is a one-dimensional concept.
VALEYARD: Fortunately, there is a reality that you and I can both agree on. The ultimate reality.
DOCTOR: Death?
VALEYARD: The undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns.
DOCTOR: Puzzles the will. Hamlet, act three scene one.
VALEYARD: I really must curb these urges. I've no wish to be contaminated by your whims and idiosyncrasies.
DOCTOR: Quite so. But what I don't comprehend
GLITZ: He's over here, Doc. Slippery customer, your other persona.
DOCTOR: What I don't comprehend is why you want me dead. No. No, let me rephrase that. It would satisfy my curiosity to know why you should go to such extraordinary lengths to kill me.
VALEYARD: Come now, Doctor. How else can I obtain my freedom, operate as a complete entity, unfettered by your side of my existence? Only by ridding myself of you and your misplaced morality, your constant crusading, your
GLITZ: Idiotic honesty?
VALEYARD: Oaf. Microbe.
GLITZ: Pardon me for trying to help. I'm neutral in this set-up, you know.
VALEYARD: Only by releasing myself from the misguided maxims that you nurture can I be free.
GLITZ: Sounds to me like Armageddon's beckoning you, Doc.
VALEYARD: With you destroyed and no longer able to constrain me, and with unlimited access to the Matrix, there will be nothing beyond my reach.
GLITZ: Where are you off to now?
DOCTOR: To trace the Valeyard.
GLITZ: But he was here.
DOCTOR: Illusion, Glitz. The shadow, not the substance. But if you don't want to come, you can stay here and build sandcastles. I'm sure if you think hard enough, you can conjure up a bucket and spade.
GLITZ: Tell you something. If you two meet face to face, five grotzits gives you ten he's first past the chequered flag.
GLITZ: What's that?
DOCTOR: Back pedal.
GLITZ: Another illusion?
DOCTOR: Alas, no.
GLITZ: Sea mist? Fog?
DOCTOR: Asphyxiating nerve gas. This is in deadly earnest.
GLITZ: You've got to tell someone else before he
DOCTOR: Run!
MEL: We can't just sit here and do nothing. We've got to help him.
INQUISITOR: The Doctor chose to enter the Matrix. We are not empowered to interfere.
KEEPER: If I may, my lady? You are applying logical thought to a situation that recognises no logic.
MEL: Give me the key to the Matrix. I'm going in there.
MASTER: Welcome, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, I never thought I'd welcome the sight of you.
MASTER: It will not happen again.
DOCTOR: What puzzles me is why it's happening now.
MASTER: The explanation's quite simple. I want the Valeyard eliminated, and you're the most likely candidate to achieve that.
GLITZ: Hang on. You told me this fleshy fair-haired personage was the one you wanted to croak.
MASTER: With the Doctor as my enemy, I always have the advantage.
DOCTOR: Ho!
MASTER: But the Valeyard, the distillation of all that's evil in you, untainted by virtue, a composite of your every dark thought, is a different proposition. Additionally, he's infuriated me by threatening to deny me the pleasure of personally bringing about your destruction. And so he must pay the price. And you, Glitz, shall help me to collect.
GLITZ: Would I be wrong in thinking that the Doctor will soon be needing a machonite overcoat?
MASTER: Nothing so crude. He's merely being reduced to a catatonic state.
GLITZ: Cata what?
MASTER: The violent assault on his senses will trip a defensive mechanism, and his brain will switch off.
GLITZ: He'll become a zombie.
MASTER: Temporarily. Long enough for my purposes.
MASTER: Walk.
MASTER: Stop. This should prove an irresistible bait for the Valeyard.
GLITZ: You Time Lords take the cake. Talk about devious. Compared to you lot I'm as transparent as crystal. Poor old Doc.
MASTER: Stop slobbering. Get over here.
VALEYARD: You really are a second rate adversary. Did you imagine I'd be lured by such a transparent ploy?
GLITZ: This could all be an illusion.
MASTER: Then stay here and find out.
MEL : Doctor? Where are you, Doctor? Doctor!
DOCTOR: Mel?
MEL: Doctor, is that you?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, of course it's me. Where are you?
MEL: This way. Quickly.
DOCTOR: What are you doing in the Matrix?
MEL: Forget the questions. You're alive, that's all that matters. Now please, follow me before it's too late.
DOCTOR: Where are we going?
MEL: To get you out of this unholy mess.
DOCTOR: But that's the seventh door! You're taking me back to the trial room.
MEL: Doctor, trust me. Don't you see that until you've cleared your name, you're no better than the Valeyard is. A renegade on the run, an outcast.
DOCTOR: Quite the pragmatist, aren't you? You're quite right, of course. Let's get it over with.
INQUISITOR: Doctor. You owe the court an apology.
DOCTOR: Well, if I do, then it is unreservedly offered, madam.
INQUISITOR: The charge of genocide is based on your own evidence.
MEL: And refuted by the Doctor.
INQUISITOR: It seems you have a champion in this young woman.
MEL: I was there, remember?
INQUISITOR: Would you accept her as an impartial witness?
DOCTOR: I would trust Mel with my life.
INQUISITOR: Good. Keeper.
DOCTOR : The vionesium, Mel!
INQUISITOR: Is that a true record of what occurred?
MEL: What shall I say, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just tell the truth.
MEL: Yes, but I don't want her to twist it like the Valeyard did.
DOCTOR: The truth can't harm me.
MEL: That's what happened.
INQUISITOR: Is it your contention that the Doctor was solely responsible for devising the scheme we are presently reviewing on the Matrix?
MEL: Oh, absolutely. Without the Doctor, we'd all ended up on the Vervoid's revolting compost heap.
INQUISITOR: A unique solution.
MEL: Out of this world.
INQUISITOR: An appropriate expression, wouldn't you say, my lords?
MEL: Appropriate? Something's going wrong here. I can sense it. You said the truth couldn't harm you, yet I have the feeling I'm attending a lynching party. Tell them you had no choice, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There's always a choice.
INQUISITOR: Doctor, you stand accused of genocide. The evidence is incontrovertible. The verdict is guilty.
MEL: No!
INQUISITOR: Your life is therefore forfeit. Take him from this court.
MEL: No, leave him alone!
DOCTOR: Unless we are prepared to sacrifice our lives for the good of all, then evil and anarchy will spread like the plague. The rule of law must prevail. Madam, I accept your verdict.
MEL: Switch it off. Switch it off! The Doctor's been tricked into believing that that was the real trial room. The Valeyard's illusion has deliberately taken advantage of the Doctor's romantic nature. He's convinced he must sacrifice himself, and you're content to let him.
INQUISITOR: We cannot interfere.
MEL: Well, I can!
CHILDREN : London's burning, London's burning.
VALEYARD : Glitz. Glitz. Sabalom Glitz.
VALEYARD : Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead.
DOCTOR: It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done. It is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.
MEL: Never mind the Sydney Carton heroics. You're not signing on as a martyr yet.
DOCTOR: Go away, Mel. Go away.
MEL: That trial was an illusion.
DOCTOR: Ow! You've ruined everything.
MEL: Ruined? I've just saved your neck.
DOCTOR: All you've done is keep me from a confrontation with the Valeyard.
MEL: But you were on your way to
DOCTOR: To a death chamber as a result of a bogus trial and my noble act of self-sacrifice.
MEL: You knew it was an illusion? How come?
DOCTOR: Because of you, Mel. In your evidence you testified you'd heard me deny the charge of genocide, but you weren't even there. You hadn't been inside the courtroom at that time. And with your extraordinary ability of total recall, you wouldn't have made such an elementary mistake.
MEL: Okay, okay, I'm not deaf.
DOCTOR: The Valeyard overestimates his own cleverness. Like all megalomaniacs, he is consumed with his own vanity. There, that should inflame his bloated ego. Come on.
MEL: Where?
DOCTOR: To find Mister J J Chambers.
MASTER: I want you to rejoin the Doctor and lead him to the Valeyard.
GLITZ: No chance. You don't catch me going near no more quill pens again.
GLITZ: I'm just going to stay here till I can get back to my own kind and some honest thieving.
MASTER: Splendid, splendid. Listen to me. Are you listening, Sabalom Glitz?
GLITZ: Not really. I was just wondering how many grotzits this little bauble cost you.
MASTER: Perhaps this will appeal to your crass soul.
GLITZ: Truly a wondrous sight for a connoisseur such as myself. There isn't a living creature in the universe I couldn't bribe with this little lot.
MASTER: Yours, if you follow my orders.
 i
MEL: I still reckon we'd be better off outside the Matrix.
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, you do?
MEL: It seems to me we should try and draw the Valeyard out to where the odds would be more even.
DOCTOR: And how do we do that?
MEL: I hate to say this but, er, use you as bait.
DOCTOR: Assuming that it's me he's after.
MEL: Oh, come on. Just look at the elaborate lengths he's gone to already.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, they were elaborate, weren't they? Perhaps too elaborate.
MEL: There are times in our relationship when I feel an interpreter wouldn't come amiss.
DOCTOR: Don't go through that
DOCTOR: Door.
POPPLEWICK: Sticky fingers, Mister Glitz?
GLITZ: The Matrix memory bank. I thought this was destroyed on Ravalox.
POPPLEWICK: That was a duplicate. This is the master tape.
GLITZ: Phase three, four, five and six. All the secrets of the Matrix.
POPPLEWICK: Not all. The primitive phases one and two have been relegated to the archives. Now kindly put it back and do as you're told.
GLITZ: I'd give my soul for this.
POPPLEWICK: You would? Would you, indeed.
GLITZ: You'd like to negotiate, Mister Popplewick? Sir?
DOCTOR: Look at this, Mel.
MEL: A list of names.
DOCTOR: Of Time Lords attending my trial. Every member of the Ultimate Court of Appeal, the supreme guardians of Gallifreyan law.
MEL: Why are they all crossed through?
DOCTOR: Do you notice something else?
MEL: No.
DOCTOR: The handwriting.
MEL: It's yours.
POPPLEWICK: I really must protest at this unseemly behaviour. You are contravening all known procedure.
GLITZ: Due to my not inconsiderable powers of persuasion
GLITZ: This minion has agreed to take us to his boss, the mysterious Mister J J Chambers.
DOCTOR: Will you lead the way, Mister Popplewick?
POPPLEWICK: No! No, not through there. Mister Chambers is across the courtyard, sir.
GLITZ: If he isn't, there'll be one bureaucrat less in the Matrix.
DOCTOR: Ah, just a minute. You won't be needing this, Mister Popplewick.
GLITZ: Very astute of you, Doc. You should live a long time.
DOCTOR: I already have. Over nine hundred years.
MEL: What's the secret?
DOCTOR: Secret, Mel? What secret?
DOCTOR: You know, I am beginning to realise that I have misjudged Mister J J Chambers, alias the Valeyard.
MEL: Not for the first time. In fact, how you've managed to survive nine hundred odd years beats me.
GLITZ: We had an agreement. I've done my bit. I've delivered the Doctor.
GLITZ: Uh uh. The Matrix memory tapes first.
POPPLEWICK: Oh, very well.
GLITZ: Tell the Doctor I didn't sell him down the Milky Way for nothing.
POPPLEWICK: I'm sure that will be a consolation to him in his final moments.
MASTER: Very astute, Sabalom Glitz, but this is loaded.
GLITZ: What's that for? I thought we trusted each other. I was on my way to see you.
MASTER: My trust of you is in equal proportion to your trust of me. The Tardis is over there.
DOCTOR: Oh, doesn't it fill you with admiration, Mel, eh? Such craftsmanship. Pride in every cog and piston.
MEL: Doctor, there is another priority. The Valeyard, remember?
DOCTOR: Yeah, how could I forget.
MEL: Where's Glitz?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Decided to stay outside on guard perhaps, eh, Mister Popplewick?
POPPLEWICK: Er, yes. I perceive Mister Chambers is not here. I shall go and find him for you, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you do that, Mister Popplewick.
MEL: If I knew what you were looking for, maybe I could help.
POPPLEWICK: I'm awfully sorry, sir. I don't seem to be able to locate Mister Chambers.
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I rather thought you might have some trouble. Who's that?
DOCTOR: Don't just stand there, Mel, help me!
POPPLEWICK: Unhand me! Stop!
POPPLEWICK: This is preposterous. You will regret this. Mister Chambers will demand an explanation for this iniquitous, this wicked behaviour.
DOCTOR: Well, let's ask him, shall we?
MEL: How did you know?
DOCTOR: The performance was too grotesque to be real. I have never been able to resist a touch of the Grand Guignol. Have we?
VALEYARD: You'll soon have ample scope to indulge in melodrama.
DOCTOR: Really? Why?
MEL: A megabyte modem.
DOCTOR: A maser.
MEL: A maser?
DOCTOR: An acronym, for microwave amplification and stimulated emission of radiation.
MEL: But what does it do?
VALEYARD: Yes, Doctor. Enlighten us. Disseminate the news.
DOCTOR: Disseminate? A particle disseminator?
VALEYARD: The ultimate weapon. Even subatomic particles, gravitons, quarks, tau mesons, all completely disseminated.
MEL: Destroy us and you destroy yourself. What's the joke?
DOCTOR: I've just realised. My writing. Our writing. A hit list.
MEL: But how? These Time Lords, or supreme guardians of the law, as you called them, are all in the trial room, and we're in the Matrix.
DOCTOR: The Matrix screen. Mel, get back to the trial room. Tell them to disconnect the Matrix screen and evacuate the court.
MEL: But I can't leave you
DOCTOR: Go! Do it, or there'll be mass murder.
VALEYARD: Bwahahahahahaha!
KEEPER: My lady, an urgent message. The High Council has been deposed. Insurrectionists are running amok on Gallifrey.
MASTER : Thank you, Keeper. That is the news I'd been awaiting. Listen carefully. I have an edict to deliver. Somewhere the Valeyard and the Doctor are engaged in their squalid duel. With luck, they'll kill each other, but that is a mere coincidental occurrence. What I have to impart is of vital importance to all of you. Now that Gallifrey is collapsing into chaos, none of you will be needed. Your office will be abolished. Only I can impose order. I have control of the Matrix. To disregard my commands will be to invite summary execution.
GLITZ: Now that you've purged that from your system, can we get on? Load the cassette.
MASTER: You really are the archetypal philistine.
MASTER: Moments such as this should be savoured.
GLITZ: Wha? What's happening?
MASTER: A limbo atrophier.
GLITZ: A limbo atrophier?
VALEYARD: You are elevating futility to a high art. There's nothing you can do to prevent the catharsis of spurious morality.
DOCTOR: If you could compile this monstrosity, it follows that I should be able to unravel it.
MEL: Disconnect the Matrix!
INQUISITOR: We cannot switch off without the Keeper, and he's not present.
MEL: Then get out of here, quickly. Your lives depend on it.
DOCTOR: Eureka! And you said it couldn't be immobilised.
VALEYARD: What have you done?
DOCTOR: Induced an anti-phase signal into the telemetry unit. The whole system should self-destruct.
VALEYARD: You blundering imbecile. You triggered a ray phase shift that may amass a feedback into here.
DOCTOR: No!
VALEYARD: No. It's too late!
DOCTOR: Ah. Now, let me see. Where were we? I was about to be sentenced, I believe.
INQUISITOR: All charges against you are dismissed, Doctor. We owe you an immense debt of gratitude, which I can partly repay by telling you that the young woman, Miss Perpugilliam Brown, is alive and well and living as a warrior queen with King Yrcanos.
DOCTOR: Ah. Verumnic.
INQUISITOR: Now then, once law and order have been restored, a new High Council will need to be elected. Can I persuade you to stand for Lord President again?
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah ha. I've a better idea.
MEL: He's going to suggest you stand.
DOCTOR: Indeed I am. And were there such a thing as an intergalactic postal vote, you'd have mine.
MEL: I shouldn't broadcast that, if I were you.
DOCTOR: Oh, you could do me one small favour, if you would.
INQUISITOR: Simply name it.
DOCTOR: When the Matrix is restored, you can do what you like with the Master, but exercise leniency with Sabalom Glitz. He's not beyond redemption.
MEL: Just don't let him anywhere near the crown jewels.
DOCTOR: Gallifrey doesn't have any crown jewels.
MEL: Right. A bracing glass of carrot juice.
DOCTOR: Carrot juice?
MEL: And then we'll get you back on the exerciser.
DOCTOR: You know, I think I was rash in turning down that offer of the Presidency.
MEL: Come on.
DOCTOR: Oh. Carrot juice?
DOCTOR : Carrot juice, carrot juice, carrot juice.
INQUISITOR: Repair the Matrix, Keeper. Requisition anything you need.
KEEPER: My Lady.
