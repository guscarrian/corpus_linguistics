The Two Doctors
Part One
DOCTOR 2: Come here, Jamie. Look at that.
JAMIE: Look at the size of that thing, Doctor. 
DOCTOR 2: Yes, Jamie. It is a big one.
JAMIE: Just a wee laboratory, eh?
DOCTOR 2: Well, it's, obviously, it's grown.
JAMIE: It's like twenty castles in the sky! Are you sure we've come to the right place?
DOCTOR 2: Of course I am.
JAMIE: We don't usually get to where you say we're going.
DOCTOR 2: I got Victoria to where she wanted to go, though why she wants to learn graphology, I've no idea.
JAMIE: Ah. Will we ever get back to her, though?
DOCTOR 2: Of course we will.
JAMIE: I'll believe that when I see it.
DOCTOR 2: At the moment, we have other things to worry about. Look at this!
JAMIE: What?
JAMIE: Hey, I've not seen that before.
DOCTOR 2: It's not been here before. It's a teleport control. You'd think I'd never flown a Tardis solo!
JAMIE: What's it do?
DOCTOR 2: It gives the Time Lords dual control. Infernal cheek. I shall complain when this is over. Now then, I think we'll just dematerialise to avoid their detection beams, and slip in quietly.
JAMIE: Er, I thought you said they were friendly.
DOCTOR 2: Friendly? I should think they'll be overwhelmingly so.
JAMIE: Then why are we slipping in quietly?
DOCTOR 2: Jamie, some of the most brilliant scientists in the universe have assembled here to work together in pure research. I don't want them to know that I've arrived.
JAMIE: Why not?
DOCTOR 2: Think of the commotion! They'll all be scrambling around wanting my autograph. No, no, no, I just want a quiet word with old Dastari, Head of Projects.
DOCTOR 2: Right then.
DOCTOR 2: Splendid! We've hit conterminous time again.
JAMIE: Well, we've certainly hit something.
DOCTOR 2: Now, Jamie. Right, follow me.
DOCTOR 2: Wait.
JAMIE: What? What?
DOCTOR 2: We'd better take the recall disk.
DOCTOR 2: And Jamie? Don't go wandering off. Stay with me.
JAMIE: Do I ever?
DOCTOR 2: It has been known. And, er, let me do the talking.
DOCTOR 2: All you have to do is to stand in the background, and admire my
BOTH: Diplomatic skills.
SHOCKEYE: How dare you! How dare you transmat that object into my kitchens?
DOCTOR 2: How dare you have the impertinence to address me like that?
SHOCKEYE: I am Shockeye, o' the Quauncing Grig!
DOCTOR 2: I'm not interested in the pedigree of an Androgum. 
SHOCKEYE: Stay!
DOCTOR 2: I am a Time Lord.
SHOCKEYE: Oh. Oh, I. My humblest apologies. I should have realised.
SHOCKEYE: But this one with you?
DOCTOR 2: He is from the planet Earth. A human.
SHOCKEYE: A Tellurian? Oh! I have not seen one of these before. Is it a gift for Dastari?
DOCTOR 2: A gift?
SHOCKEYE: Oh, such a soft white skin, whispering of a tender succulence. Dastari will not appreciate its qualities, you know. He has no sensual refinement. Let me buy it from you.
DOCTOR 2: My companion is not for sale!
SHOCKEYE: I promise you lord, no chef in the nine planets would do more to bring out the flavour of the beast.
DOCTOR 2: You get on with your butchery. Come along, Jamie.
SHOCKEYE: Oh. Oh. I can just taste that flesh.
JAMIE: Who was that?
DOCTOR 2: Shockeye of the Quauncing Grig, so he said.
JAMIE: I know what he said, but
DOCTOR 2: He's an Androgum, Jamie. The Androgums are the servitors here. They do all the station maintenance.
JAMIE: Ah, you mean a scullion.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, with a high opinion of himself. Chefs usually have.
JAMIE: It's the Tardis!
CHESSENE: Our allies won't care for that. I promised the Group Marshal he could have the Time Lord's machine.
SHOCKEYE: Will it make any difference?
CHESSENE: Not to me. I still have the Kartz-Reimer module. But it shows the Gallifreyans are suspicious, so I was right to lay the plans I did.
SHOCKEYE: So now we wait.
CHESSENE: Not for long. Stike is moving.
SHOCKEYE: Already? The calgesic won't have affected the scientists yet.
CHESSENE: It will by the time Stike's forces arrive.
SHOCKEYE: Ah. Did they enjoy the meal?
CHESSENE: Dastari said you had surpassed yourself.
SHOCKEYE: Oh! Being unable to taste it, I worried that it might be over-seasoned.
CHESSENE: Shockeye, their last supper would have added lustre to your reputation.
SHOCKEYE: Oh.
CHESSENE: Except that they won't live to remember it.
DASTARI: I remember it very clearly, Doctor. You came to our inauguration, bearing fraternal greetings from Gallifrey.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes. That was before I, er, fell from favour. I'm a bit of an exile these days.
DASTARI: Yes, I heard something about that. But you still act on their instructions.
DOCTOR 2: It's the price I pay for my freedom.
DASTARI: Needless to say, we've had no support at all from your people.
DOCTOR 2: Oh, Dastari, you can't have expected help from the Time Lords. Their policy is one of strict neutrality.
DASTARI: Nonetheless, there's been widespread disappointment among the other Third Zone governments.
DOCTOR 2: Don't chide me, Dastari. I'm simply a messenger. Officially, I'm here quite unofficially.
DASTARI: You'll explain that paradox, I know.
DOCTOR 2: I'm a pariah, exiled from Time Lord society, so they can always deny sending me.
DASTARI: And why have they sent you?
DOCTOR 2: They have been monitoring the experiments in time travel of the Professors Kartz and Reimer. They want them stopped.
DASTARI: I see And how do the Time Lords equate that with a policy of complete neutrality?
DOCTOR 2: They don't have to. As I said, I have no official existence, so they can always deny sending me.
DASTARI: Oh, typical. Typical hypocrisy.
DASTARI: Yes, Chessene?
CHESSENE: I wondered if your guests require refreshment, Professor.
JAMIE: Ah, well, er
DOCTOR 2: No, thank you. We've already eaten.
JAMIE: Aye, but that was yesterday.
DOCTOR 2: One meal a day is quite sufficient, Jamie.
DASTARI: Are you sure?
DOCTOR 2: Yes.
DASTARI: Thank you, Chessene.
CHESSENE: Very good, Professor.
DASTARI: Well, Doctor, what did you make of our chatelaine?
DOCTOR 2: Was she an Androgum?
DASTARI: She was. Now she's an Androgum TA. Technologically augmented.
DOCTOR 2: Oh, one of your biological experiments.
DASTARI: I've carried out nine augmentations on Chessene. She's at mega-genius level now. I'm very proud of her.
DOCTOR 2: Proud of her, or your own skill?
DASTARI: Perhaps a little of both, but all that Androgum energy is now functioning on a higher plane. She spends days in the databanks simply sucking in knowledge.
DOCTOR 2: She's still an Androgum. You can't change nature.
DASTARI: In Chessene's case, I believe I have.
DOCTOR 2: That's dangerous ground, Dastari. You give a monkey control of its environment, it'll fill the world with bananas.
DASTARI: Oh really, Doctor. I expected something more progressive from you. Don't you understand the tremendous implications of my work?
DOCTOR 2: Yes, that's why I say it's so dangerous!
DASTARI: Doctor, our races have become tired and effete. Our seed is thin. We must hand the baton of progress to others. If I can raise the Androgums to a higher plane of consciousness, there's no limit to what that boiling energy might achieve.
DOCTOR 2: Dastari, I have no doubt you could augment an earwig to the point where it understood nuclear physics, but it'd still be a very stupid thing to do!
TECHNICIAN: Identify!
COMPUTER: The approaching craft are Sontaran battle cruisers. Their intention is hostile.
TECHNICIAN: Operate the defence.
COMPUTER: Please complete your last instructions.
CHESSENE: The last instruction is cancelled. Maintain normal surveillance.
COMPUTER: Normal surveillance.
CHESSENE: Open all docking bays.
DOCTOR: Don't do that! You'll frighten the fish.
PERI: What fish? Doctor, I'm bored. We've been here for hours.
DOCTOR: You know, I think it was Rassilon who once said, there are few ways in which a Time Lord can be more innocently occupied, then in catching fish.
PERI: That's a whopper.
DOCTOR: Where? I don't see one.
PERI: It was Doctor Johnson who said that, about money.
DOCTOR: Well, what's the use of a good quotation if you can't change it?
PERI: Anyway, you're not innocently employed in catching fish, are you?
DOCTOR: They're just lazy today. Any angler will tell you there are times when nothing will tempt them.
PERI: That so?
DOCTOR: The last time I fished this particular stretch, I landed four magnificent gumblejack in less than ten minutes.
PERI: Gumblejack?
DOCTOR: The finest fish in this galaxy, probably the universe. Cleaned, skinned, quickly pan-fried in their own juices till they're golden brown. Ambrosia steeped in nectar, Peri. The flavour is unforgettable. I think I've got a bite!
PERI: At last.
DOCTOR: That's it, yes. Give him his head.
PERI: You really caught something?
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, this fellow's putting up a fight. Stand by with the gaff, Peri.
PERI: I'm not sticking that thing in a poor little fish.
DOCTOR: Not so little, Peri. Not so little at all. By the feel of this, it might be a record.
PERI: Oh, wow, Doctor. That must weigh very nearly an ounce.
DOCTOR: Yes.. but did you see the one that got away? That magnificent gumblejack that was trying to eat this poor little fellow. There.
DASTARI: Even if I wanted to, Doctor, I have no authority to order Professors Kartz and Reimer to abandon their work.
DOCTOR 2: Of course you have. You sanction all the experiments on this station.
DASTARI: And what reason would I give? That the Time Lords have expressed concern?
DOCTOR 2: Dastari, our monitors have already detected ripples of up to point four on the Bocher scale. Anything much higher would threaten the whole fabric of time!
DASTARI: They are well aware of the dangers, Doctor. They are responsible scientists.
DOCTOR 2: They're incompetent meddlers.
DASTARI: Aren't you being a little ingenuous, Doctor?
DOCTOR 2: What do you mean?
DASTARI: Hasn't it occurred to you that the Time Lords have a vested interest in ensuring that others do not discover their secrets?
DOCTOR 2: Oh, I'm sure that's not the case.
DASTARI: I gather your own machine is no longer in the station. Isn't that because you didn't want Kartz and Reimer to get a look at it?
DOCTOR 2: Look, I've a suggestion. Stop these experiments for the time being, whilst my people study their work. If Kartz and Reimer really are on safe lines, I'm sure they'll be allowed to continue.
DASTARI: Allowed to continue?
DOCTOR 2: I mean, there would be no further objection.
DASTARI: In the first place, I have no authority to ask Kartz and Reimer to submit their work for analysis. And in the second place, the Time Lords have no right to make such a grossly unethical demand. I've never heard such unmitigated arrogance!
DOCTOR 2: And I've never heard such specious claptrap! Oh, don't you prate to me about ethics! The balance of the space-time continuum could be destroyed by your ham-fisted numbskulls.
DASTARI: I don't feel there's anything to be gained by prolonging this discussion, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Dastari, you have more letters after your name than anyone I know. Enough for two alphabets. How is it you can be such a stupid, stubborn, irrational, and thoroughly objectionable old idiot?
DOCTOR 2: And what are you smiling at, you, you hairy-legged Highlander?
JAMIE: I'm just admiring your diplomatic skills.
DOCTOR 2: Pah! Dastari?
JAMIE: He's got his head doon, Doctor. I can't say I blame him.
DOCTOR 2: I'll thank you not to speak in that appalling mongrel dialect.
JAMIE: I mean, he's gone to sleep.
DOCTOR 2: He's no' asleep.
JAMIE: Ah!
DOCTOR 2: He's not asleep Jamie. He's drugged!
JAMIE: He's what?
JAMIE: What's that?
DOCTOR 2: I would have thought a Jacobite would recognise that sound.
SCIENTIST: Professor!
DOCTOR 2: Jamie, run.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR 2: Run, I say! Save yourself!
DOCTOR: We'll try our luck at the Great Lakes of Pandatorea.
PERI: Must we?
DOCTOR: Hm? Oh, you've never seen such fish. And as for the Pandatorean conga, it's longer than your railway trains.
PERI: I don't think I wish to know. What is all this fishing stuff, anyway?
DOCTOR: It's restful, relaxing. I think I've been overdoing things. I haven't felt at all myself, lately.
PERI: I don't know which is yourself.
DOCTOR: Exactly. This re
DOCTOR: Generation.
PERI: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Regen
PERI: Doctor! What's wrong?
JAMIE: Doctor!
SHOCKEYE: Whoa, there. Steady now. Quiet, boy. Easy. Shockeye will not hurt you.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, we are wild, aren't we?
CHESSENE : Shockeye! Why aren't you on the ship?
SHOCKEYE: I was just collecting some provisions, madam.
CHESSENE: The ship is fully stocked.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, but the standard rations are so boring. These are a few special things for the journey. A cold collation I prepared.
SHOCKEYE: Grr! The Tellurian has escaped.
CHESSENE: Stike will leave nothing alive.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, but such a waste, madam.
CHESSENE: We must go. Bring the hamper.
SHOCKEYE: Er, have you decided on our destination?
CHESSENE: It's unimportant.
SHOCKEYE: Earth?
CHESSENE: If you wish. But why Earth?
SHOCKEYE: I have a desire to taste one of these human beasts, madam. The meat looks so white and roundsomely layered on the bone, a sure sign of a tasty animal.
CHESSENE: You think of nothing but your stomach, do you, Shockeye.
SHOCKEYE: The gratification of pleasure is the sole motive of action. Is that not our law?
CHESSENE: I still accept it, but there are pleasures other than the purely sensual.
SHOCKEYE: For you, perhaps. Fortunately, I have not been augmented.
CHESSENE: Take care. Your purity could easily become insufferable.
SHOCKEYE: These days, you no longer use your karam name, do you, Chessene o' the Franzine Grig? 
CHESSENE: Do you think for one moment that I forget that I bear the sacred blood of the Franzine Grig? But that noble history lies behind me, while ahead? Oh, ahead lies a vision.
PERI: Doctor, er, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Of course I'm not all right! What happened?
PERI: I think you fainted.
DOCTOR: I never faint. I remember now. I felt a weakness. I felt a weakness and then I, I was in another place.
PERI: Can I get you anything? Celery! That's what you need.
DOCTOR: Celery, yes. And the tensile strength of jelly babies! But I, I had a clarinet. Or was it a flute? Something you blew into.
PERI: A glass of water?
DOCTOR: Water? No, don't think so. A recorder! That's what it was. Some kind of mind lock. 
PERI: Doctor, you're not making any sense.
DOCTOR: I am making perfect sense. I was being put to death!
PERI: I think you should sit down.
DOCTOR: Sit down? They're executing me! Except it wasn't that way. It didn't end like that, so it's not possible.
PERI: What isn't possible?
DOCTOR: Well, I exist. I'm here, now, therefore I cannot have been killed then. That is irrefutable logic, isn't it?
PERI: Don't worry about it.
DOCTOR: But the there and then subsumes the here and now, so if I was killed then, I could only exist now as some sort of temporal tautology. That also is irrefutable.
PERI: Circular logic will only make you dizzy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The most likely explanation, of course, is that I haven't synchronised properly yet. Some kind of time-slip in the subconscious.
PERI: Perhaps you should see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Are you trying to be funny?
PERI: No, it was just a suggestion.
DOCTOR: Actually, that's not such a bad idea.
DOCTOR: Now, then. Archimedes. Fascinating chap, bit wet. Brunel. Christopher Columbus.  He had a lot to answer for. Dante, Da Vinci, Dastari! Joinson Dastari, HP One. Head of Projects, Space Station Chimera, Third Zone. That's him!
PERI: Who?
DOCTOR: Dastari! The pioneer of genetic engineering. Be worth a trip, anyway. Dastari's people are doing some fascinating work on Rho mesons as the unstable factor in pin galaxies.
PERI: I can hardly wait. What are pin galaxies?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, they're galaxies within the universe of the atom. Difficult to study. They only exist for one attosecond.
PERI: Doctor, I have no idea what that means.
DOCTOR: It means you have to be quick. An attosecond is a quintillionth of a second. Right, here we go.
DOCTOR: You know, that was a good idea of mine, wasn't it?
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: Getting medical help.
PERI: Ugh! Oh, Doctor, it's foul. Are you sure it's safe?
DOCTOR: Plenty of oxygen.
PERI: Yeah, but that awful smell.
DOCTOR: Mainly decaying food  and corpses.
PERI: Corpses?
DOCTOR: That is the smell of death, Peri. Ancient musk, heavy in the air. Fruit-soft flesh, peeling from white bones. The unholy, unburiable smell of Armageddon. Nothing quite so evocative as one's sense of smell, is there?
PERI: I feel sick.
DOCTOR: I think you'll feel a good deal sicker before we're finished here.
DOCTOR: Laser bolt there, do you see?
DOCTOR: And there. It must have been quite a fight.
PERI: Look!
DOCTOR: Quite recently, too, otherwise the atmosphere would have cleared.
PERI: Do you think we should go on any further?
DOCTOR: What?
PERI: Well, I mean, if there's no one left alive, there's nothing we can do now, is there?
DOCTOR: I want to find out what happened here. Look, you can go back to the Tardis if you like.
PERI: No, I'll stay with you.
DOCTOR: When I first saw this station, I thought of comet strike, or some such natural disaster, but it's been deliberately destroyed! Now, what kind of monster would want to stop the brilliant work that was being done here? Pure research, for its own sake, It threatened no one.
COMPUTER: It threatened the Time Lords.
DOCTOR: Would you care to repeat that?
COMPUTER: It threatened the Time Lords.
DOCTOR: And what put that idea into your apology for a brain?
COMPUTER: Return to your ship and leave.
DOCTOR: Certainly not.
COMPUTER: Then this station will switch to defence alert.
DOCTOR: I will not be threatened by a computer. And put some lights on!
PERI: How do you know it's a computer?
DOCTOR: My dear girl, I know a computer when I talk to one. Come on.
PERI: And what did it mean, defence alert?
DOCTOR:  The usual. Floor trips, electronic sensors, death rays, jets of nerve gas. Nothing to worry about.
PERI: Oh, good. I was afraid it might mean something serious.
DOCTOR: As long as we keep our wits about us.
PERI: What's that noise?
DOCTOR: It's depressurising this section. Got to get out of here. No power.
PERI: It's getting colder!
DOCTOR: It will, but we'll die from lack of air before we freeze to death.
PERI: How long?
DOCTOR: Not many minutes. We've got to get out of this passageway.
DOCTOR: Ah! Thought there'd be one.
PERI: Clever.
PERI: Nothing's happening.
DOCTOR: Got to build hydraulic pressure.
CHESSENE: Excellent. I detect only one occupant, a female.
SHOCKEYE: Don't use the gas injector, madam. They give the flesh an acrid taste. I'll slaughter it myself.
CHESSENE: It might not be edible, Shockeye. I detect great age. Come!
DOCTOR: Are you feeling better?
PERI: Thanks. Where are we?
DOCTOR: Dastari's office.
PERI: How do you know?
DOCTOR: He liked old familiar things around him. He worked out the famous theory of parallel matter at that desk. And in pen and ink. He detested computers.
PERI: You speak as though you're sure he's dead.
DOCTOR: They're all dead, Peri. Forty of the finest scientific minds ever assembled in one place. The barbarity of such a deed, I find scarcely conceivable.
PERI: Were they a threat to the Time Lords?
DOCTOR: Absolute rubbish. This institute was a threat to no one. It's only purpose was to add to the sum total of knowledge.
PERI: Well, then why did the computer say that
DOCTOR: Oh, don't know. Not yet. Programmed to say that, presumably.
PERI: What's that for?
DOCTOR: Switching to visual. Must have lost track of us.
PERI: Well, I haven't seen any lenses.
DOCTOR: There'll be an electronic eye somewhere. Do you notice the floor?
PERI: What about it?
DOCTOR: Cork insulation and carpet.
PERI: So your friend liked to be comfortable, even in space.
DOCTOR: It's been tracking us by the heat of our feet. In here, it couldn't detect us.
PERI: You mean it got worried and switched the lights on?
DOCTOR: Something like that. I wonder what it'll try next.
PERI: You don't think it'll just leave us alone?
DOCTOR: Most unlikely. Think of it as a game, between it and us.
PERI: I love games, Doctor. Games where I'm not expecting to end up dead. Are you listening?
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, they were doing some fascinating work here. This is Dastari's day journal.
PERI: You've told me all I want to know about pin galaxies.
DOCTOR: Some people called Kartz and Reimer were having some success, it seems, with experiments in time control.
PERI: But you can already do that.
DOCTOR: Well, I can, yes, but I didn't realise the Third Zoners were that close to, to the breakthrough.
PERI: Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: This last entry. The Time Lords are demanding that Kartz and Reimer suspend their work, alleging their experiments are imperiling the continuum. No proof was offered to support this charge, so I rejected the demand. Colleagues fear they may forcibly intervene? All agreed that we must stand firm and refuse to be intimidated.
PERI: So it was the Time Lords.
DOCTOR: No, it's not possible! No matter how dangerous the experiments they were doing, they'd have found some other way of halting them. Not this massacre.
PERI: Well, maybe they couldn't find another way.
DOCTOR: No! It's unbelievable that they would commit such an atrocity. The use of force is alien to Time Lord nature.
PERI: Well, perhaps they thought the ends justified the means. Isn't that always the excuse for something really bad?
DOCTOR: No, I won't believe it. There must be some other explanation.
PERI: Well, maybe someone's setting the Time Lords up.
DOCTOR: Setting them up? Setting, setting them up. You know, sometimes, young Peri, you make amazingly shrewd remarks. Yes. It could be a crude attempt to drive a wedge between Gallifrey and the Third Zone governments.
PERI: But who'd benefit from that?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I intend to find out.
PERI: That's if we get out of here alive.
DOCTOR: Hm? Oh, yes, I was forgetting that. We still have our homicidal computer to deal with.
PERI: It's getting awfully hot and stuffy in here now.
DOCTOR: Yes. Having failed to freeze us to death, it's now trying to bake us. It appears to be a machine with a distinctly limited repertoire.
PERI: Who needs anything fancy? Oh Doctor, we've got to get out of here.
DOCTOR: We have to do better than that. We've got to find our way to the control centre and turn the wretched thing off.
PERI: Well, how're we going to do that without being zapped on the way?
DOCTOR: Zapped? We'll have to find our way down into the infrastructure and work our way across. We'll be cramped down there, but safer than going on the walkways.
DOCTOR: Not so much as a paper clip! You'd think someone like Dastari would keep a few useful odds and ends around.
PERI: Oh, Doctor, it's absolutely stifling now.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it is a bit uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: As I thought. I could trip this if I had a bit of wire. 
PERI: Well, what are you trying to do?
DOCTOR: Save us from death by dehydration. That computer's been forced to turn the power on, but it hasn't energized the door locks. If only I could. Ah ha! Here you are.
DOCTOR: Now.
DOCTOR: Voila! You know, I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.
ARANA: Qui�n est� aqu�?
SHOCKEYE: It cannot see.
ARANA: You are English? Qui�n est�?
SHOCKEYE: The creature's bones are dry and brittle.
CHESSENE: I sensed it was very old, but its mind will be of use. Bring it through.
SHOCKEYE: You carry it, Varl.
VARL: I do not take orders from civilians.
DOCTOR: Ah. This looks big enough to get down.
PERI: Well, can't we just take off?
DOCTOR: Not until I find out exactly what happened here.
PERI: Doctor, look!
DOCTOR: We haven't got time to bother about dead Androgums, Peri.
PERI: Ugh. Well, how do you know it's an Androgum?
DOCTOR: I know an Androgum when I see one. Come on!
DOCTOR: Right, shouldn't be too far down. Just put your arms over your head, and slide.
PERI: What happens if I get stuck?
DOCTOR: I shouldn't advise that. I'll be right behind you.
PERI: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: That was a bit further down than I expected. Oh.
PERI: Well, it's all right coming down. How are we ever going to get back up again? 
DOCTOR: Oh, there'll be service hatches. Ow!
PERI: You did say it would be cramped.
DOCTOR: Thanks for reminding me. This way, I think.
PERI: How can you tell?
DOCTOR: Well, apart from possessing an unerring sense of direction, all the service ducts lead this way. They must lead up to the control centre.
DOCTOR: Ah.
PERI: Oh!
DOCTOR: You all right?
PERI: Sure. Can't remember when I last had so much fun.
CHESSENE: Where is Varl?
SHOCKEYE: Oh, he's setting up a homing beacon for the Sontaran ship.
CHESSENE: We must ask Stike to make a discreet landing. This planet is greatly overpopulated.
SHOCKEYE: 
DOCTOR: Here, give me your hand. Good girl.
PERI: Oh, it would help if we could see.
DOCTOR: Can't be much further.
PERI: Just far enough to scrape the skin off another leg. What is all this stuff, anyway?
DOCTOR: Hm? Oh, fluidic streams. Interesting application of an old idea. Think I detect Dastari's hand in the design. There.
DOCTOR: There, you see?
PERI: Should you have done that?
DOCTOR: Oh, they're self-sealing. Now that fluid
PERI: Doctor
DOCTOR: Carries a signal, in the same way that the signal in an electronic circuit is carried by the flow of electrons. The interesting thing about a fluidic device
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What?
PERI: I thought I heard something. I was trying to listen, but you kept on talking.
DOCTOR: I was imparting a little information. When you ask a question, you should listen to the answer, my girl, otherwise, you will gain absolutely no benefit from being in my company. It is the province of knowledge to speak, and the privilege of wisdom to listen.
PERI: Privilege.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PERI: I can't tell you how privileged I feel, having been half-frozen, and asphyxiated, and cooked, and then forced to clamber through miles of pipe.
DOCTOR: Good, because we have about another mile to go. Come on.
PERI: Ah! Listen.
DOCTOR: What is it?
PERI: I heard it again! There's, there's something down here with us.
DOCTOR: It's not possible. You're imagining it.
PERI: I tell you, I'm certain I heard something.
DOCTOR: Hydraulics.
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: Well, some of these pumping systems are very old. There's bound to be the odd wheeze.
PERI: Well, that's the fiercest pump I ever heard.
DOCTOR: There's something down here with us, Peri.
PERI: Really.
DOCTOR: We must be under the central control area now.
PERI: Well, I just hope you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: If I didn't, I wouldn't be doing it. Do have a little faith.
PERI: It just looks very complicated.
DOCTOR: Not at all. These type 49 systems are colour-coded. Defence mechanisms in red, power supplies in yellow, and so forth. All we have to do is disarm that computer, then hopefully we'll get some civil answers out of the thing.
PERI: There's a ladder over here.
DOCTOR: Hm? Yes, I know. I saw it. Leads up to the central control area. Blue. You know, I can't remember what blue stands for? Oh, well.
PERI: Can I help?
DOCTOR: No, no, no. This is a job for an expert. They often booby-trap these computers to prevent tampering. Berbury's noose was a favourite.
PERI: What's that?
DOCTOR: Berbury's noose? Very nasty. Leaves you without a head.
PERI: Oh.
DOCTOR: Do you know, I wish I could remember what that blue line serves.
OSCAR: What does that say, Anita?
ANITA: Keep out.
OSCAR: Oh. Well, perhaps we'd better had.
ANITA: It doesn't matter, Oscar. It's a very old sign.
OSCAR: Well, yes, but
ANITA: No one lives on the hacienda now, only the Do�a Arana.
OSCAR: The Do�a Arana?
ANITA: An old lady, Don Vincent� Arana's widow. She never leaves the house.
OSCAR: Where is the house?
ANITA: Over that hill. Do you know, in the old days when my mother worked for the Don it was like a palace. Now it is falling down.
SHOCKEYE: Insipid muck!
VARL: Our leader is in descent orbit.
SHOCKEYE: Our leader is Chessene o' the Franzine Grig.
VARL: Marshal Stike commands the Ninth Sontaran battle group!
SHOCKEYE: He doesn't command anything here. Chessene planned this operation.
VARL: You will see. We Sontarans lead. We never follow.
SHOCKEYE: Tell him to come in on full mufflers. And that's an order from Chessene!
ANITA: Hmm, this is the place. There always used to be hundreds of moths around here.
OSCAR: Yes. Yes, it looks like splendid moth country. Of course, we are a little early. Moths are ladies of the night.
OSCAR: Painted beauties sleeping all day, and rising at the sunset to whisper through the roseate dusk on gossamer wings of damask and silk.
ANITA: You really like them, don't you, Oscar.
OSCAR: Oh, I adore them.
ANITA: Then why do you kill them?
OSCAR: So that I can look at them.
ANITA: What's that for?
OSCAR: Moths to the flame, my dear. And then I net them and put them in my cyanide box.
ANITA: Cyanide? Isn't that terribly dangerous?
OSCAR: Not if one is careful. I've used cyanide since I was a boy. It's quicker and kinder to the little creatures than ammonia.
ANITA: What do you do with the poor things when they're dead?
OSCAR: I mount them in my collection, so that I can sit and admire them.
ANITA: Don't you have a television?
OSCAR: Down!
OSCAR: I thought it was going to hit us!
ANITA: It landed over that way, somewhere. We ought to go and see. Somebody might need help.
OSCAR: I do hope not. I can't bear the sight of gory entrails. Well, except, of course, on the stage.
ANITA: It must have crashed!
OSCAR: Please, Anita, don't let's go any nearer. They may be suffering from hideous injuries.
ANITA: But the Do�a Arana won't be able to help them, and there's no telephone. We'll have to see if we can help.
PERI: Doctor! Over here!
DOCTOR : What is it?
PERI: I, I don't know. Well, come and see! 
DOCTOR: In a minute.
DOCTOR: There. That should just about have done it.
DOCTOR: Peri!
Part Two
PERI: Thanks for your help, Doctor!
PERI: Doctor? Wake up! Come on!
DOCTOR: What is it?
PERI: Come on, Doctor, get up.
DOCTOR: Oh, Peri. Peri, what happened? Why'd you scream?
PERI: That thing you saw was an animal attacked me, and it's human, I think.
DOCTOR: If you hadn't screamed I wouldn't have triggered that stun jet. I was expecting there'd be one. It can't be human. They haven't reached this part of the Galaxy.
PERI: Well, it's humanoid at any rate. Come and see.
DOCTOR: Vorum gas. An ordinary person would have been unconscious for hours.
PERI: So would you if I hadn't dragged you clear of it.
DOCTOR: No, no. I closed my respiratory passages as soon as I detected any danger.
PERI: Well, then, how did you breath?
DOCTOR: With difficulty. I'll explain one day. Yes, it certainly does appear to be humanoid. So it finally mustered the courage to attack.
PERI: I think it was my fault. It was just protecting its nest.
DOCTOR: Understandable.
DOCTOR: Jamie?
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: It's Jamie. How did he get here? He should be with me.
PERI: Well, he's not now, Doctor. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: No, that's right. But if he's here, where am I? I must have been here, Peri.
PERI: You mean at some past time?
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie.
JAMIE: Keep away from me!
DOCTOR: It's all right.
JAMIE: Keep away!
DOCTOR: Open that.
PERI: We're your friends, we won't hurt you.
JAMIE: Keep away.
DOCTOR: No, it's all right.
JAMIE: Keep away. Keep away.
DOCTOR: Jamie! It's all right!
DOCTOR: Don't worry, it'll help him to relax.
PERI: Relax? You've killed him.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be ridiculous. I seem to remember I was always very fond of Jamie.
PERI: He's not moving.
DOCTOR: No. His nervous system's temporarily paralysed. He'll be fine shortly.
JAMIE: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie?
PERI: He's not talking to you.
JAMIE: They killed the Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's deranged. It's often the effect of extreme fear.
JAMIE: Killed the Doctor.
PERI: Jamie?
JAMIE: They killed the Doctor
PERI: Can you hear me? My name's Peri. I'm your friend. Do you understand?
JAMIE: Friend?
PERI: Friend.
JAMIE: They killed the Doctor.
DOCTOR: He seems very sure of that.
JAMIE: Doctor
PERI: Is it possible?
DOCTOR: Of course not! I exist, therefore I am, and was.
PERI: Don't go through all that irrefutable logic again.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I remember. That mind-slip in the Tardis.
PERI: You did say you were being put to death.
DOCTOR: So I did. I wonder if it could have been here?
PERI: Don't ask me, I don't understand any of this!.
DOCTOR: Neither do I. Not yet. Now Jamie, I want you to look at this pretty little thing here. Look.
DOCTOR: See how it swings backwards and forwards, forwards and backwards. It makes your eyes feel heavy. So heavy you want to go to sleep. Sleep, Jamie. That's it. Sleep. Jamie, why did you come here with the Doctor?
JAMIE: To see Dastari.
DOCTOR: And did you see him?
JAMIE: Aye. They had an argument.
DOCTOR: The Doctor had an argument with Dastari? What about?
JAMIE: The Time Lords.
DOCTOR: What happened then, Jamie? Can you remember?
JAMIE: There was a battle. The knights came and killed everyone.
DOCTOR: The knights? What were they like, Jamie? Can you tell me?
JAMIE: They had a sort of armour. Heavy with no necks. And their hands were just two great fingers. They killed everyone.
JAMIE: They killed the Doctor! I saw them!
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. It's all right, Jamie. Now sleep. Sleep.
DOCTOR: There. He just gave a reasonably accurate description of the Sontarans.
PERI: Who?
DOCTOR: Let's see if anything's recorded in that computer.
PERI: But, but what about Jamie?
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. Sleep's the best thing for him right now.
OSCAR: Is it possible we imagined what we saw?
ANITA: Of course not.
OSCAR: You are such a pragmatist, my little flower, but if an aeroplane has crashed, then shouldn't there be wreckage?
ANITA: Of course.
OSCAR: Well, then, like a star on my dressing room door it becomes conspicuous by its absence.
ANITA: We simply haven't found it yet. We must continue to search.
OSCAR: We should summon the authorities. Competent, official people trained in the tying of bandages.
ANITA: We search! There may be people bleeding to death at this very moment.
OSCAR: I'm not a well man.
ANITA: Oh, be brave, Oscar. Think of all the publicity. Who knows, the British Council may forgive you and book you on an forthcoming tour.
DOCTOR: Of course, I never for a moment thought that it was the Time Lords.
PERI: Come on. You had your doubts.
DOCTOR: Well, only because of that last entry in Dastari's log. They must have forced him to write that before they killed him.
PERI: But why would they want to frame the Time Lords?
DOCTOR: Frame?
PERI: Make them appear guilty when they weren't.
DOCTOR: I see. Set them up. I don't know. They're rabidly xenophobic. They probably thought the Third Zoners were getting too powerful and might align themselves with the Rutans.
DOCTOR: Is that the answer?
COMPUTER: No speak.
DOCTOR: No speak? What kind of language is that?
COMPUTER: Central fault. No speak.
DOCTOR: I must have disconnected one of its linguistic neurons. Oh well, the data bank is still functioning.
PERI: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
PERI: Who are the Rutans?
DOCTOR: Oh, the Sontarans and the Rutans are old enemies. They've been fighting each other across the galaxy for so long they've almost forgotten what started it. Ah, there's the Kartz and Reimer work.
PERI: Oh, I look a mess.
DOCTOR: Of course, you can understand the Time Lords wanting to monitor their experiments. If the holistic fabric of time were ever punctured, it'd be like putting a pin into a balloon. The Universe would simply collapse.
PERI: Doctor, shall I go and see if Jamie's okay?
DOCTOR: Peri, it's possible!
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: That I was killed! It's why I collapsed, the weakness that I felt.
PERI: But you said you couldn't be dead then and here now.
DOCTOR: Yes, but if I arrived here during a time experiment, caught in an embolism and therefore outside the time flow. But if I were dead then and here now, it means that I was at the very epicentre of the engulfing chaos.
PERI: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: It means the collapse of the universe has started and nothing can stop it.
PERI: How long will it take?
DOCTOR: For everything to end? A very few centuries.
PERI: Centuries? Well, if it's going to take that long, I'll go and see if Jamie's any better.
DOCTOR: She can't comprehend the scale of it all. Eternal blackness. No more sunsets. No more gumblejacks. Never more a butterfly. Peri!
PERI: Doctor.
JAMIE: He's not the Doctor I know.
DOCTOR: I am too, Jamie McCrimmon. I am another aspect of him, just as he is of me.
JAMIE: Eh?
DOCTOR: I was him, he will be me.
JAMIE: Who will I be?
DOCTOR: Peri, look at this.
PERI: Doctor, it's horrible. Stop it!
DOCTOR: Life like, isn't it? Or rather, death like.
JAMIE: But that's how they killed the Doctor. I saw it.
DOCTOR: I don't think they did, Jamie. I'm beginning to understand, now. They left this illusion to make it appear that I was dead.
PERI: Who?
DOCTOR: The Sontarans. They wanted to prevent any investigation into my disappearance, which means I must have been held captive somewhere.
PERI: But why am I in it?
DOCTOR: That was their mistake. They left the animator switched on. When you looked into that, it copied your body print.
JAMIE: So you don't think the Doctor's dead? I mean, my Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, I don't, Jamie. And if I'm not dead in that form, it means my theory about the embolism is also wrong. Well, this begins to have all the hallmarks of a conspiracy.
PERI: What sort of conspiracy?
JAMIE: A plot.
DOCTOR: That's right, Jamie. A plot to kidnap me and Dastari as well. And he's about the only bio-geneticist in the galaxy capable of isolating the symbiotic nuclei of a Time Lord.
PERI: So that's how you control the Tardis. Symbiosis.
DOCTOR: If the Sontarans ever get unlimited access to time travel, they'll be invincible. We must find out where they're holding me.
JAMIE: How could we do that? They could be anywhere.
DOCTOR: I made contact with myself before during that mind-slip. I'll try telepathy. It's about our only chance.
DOCTOR: Now, I shall seem to be unconscious for a while, but don't worry. And while my mind is out of my body, don't touch me. Don't come anywhere near me. Any kind of contact might sever the astral link and kill me.
PERI: How long will you be?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, seconds, hours, days. Who knows? There's no such thing as time on the astral plane.
JAMIE: I think your Doctor's worse than mine.
CHESSENE: How is he?
DASTARI: This will bring him round.
DOCTOR 2: Jamie
DOCTOR: Jamie! I
PERI: Oh, come on, Doctor. Wake up!
DOCTOR: Where I am? Am where I?
PERI: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Peri. Jamie. Was I away very long?
JAMIE: Just minutes.
DOCTOR: Boing! Boing!
PERI: What?
DOCTOR: Bells, my dear! Bells! Come on, there isn't a moment to lose.
PERI: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Can't quite remember. Something to do with getting my hair cut.
VARL: That is the complete manifest.
CHESSENE: Where is Stike?
VARL: The Group Marshal has been placing the scout ship in clear in order to conceal it from the local primitives.
DASTARI: Even in clear it's still possible to detect with tracking equipment. We should have chosen a less populous planet.
CHESSENE: According to the Do�a Arana nobody comes here, even though there is a city only four kilometres away.
DASTARI: Are there any defence installations in the area?
CHESSENE: The Do�a Arana knows nothing of that. There was very little in her mind to absorb.
SHOCKEYE: Nor in her body. Nothing but bone and gristle.
DASTARI: I would have preferred somewhere completely deserted. The operation is an delicate one. We cannot risk any interruption.
CHESSENE: The Group Marshal favoured Earth. His forces are planning an attack on the Madillon Cluster, and this planet is conveniently situated. And it was also Shockeye's wish to come here.
DASTARI: And you indulged him? Why?
CHESSENE: He has a craving to savour the flesh of these human creatures. As an Androgum myself, I am aware of the potency of such desires.
DASTARI: You are no longer an Androgum, Chessene. I have raised you to a superior plane of life.
CHESSENE: There are blood-ties between the Franzine Grig and the Quauncing Grig, Dastari. Shockeye does not yet know the full nature of my intentions. When he does learn the truth he is going to feel that I have betrayed our Androgum inheritance.
DASTARI: A being of your powers cannot stay trapped forever in the traditions of blood and race. You must go on alone, Chessene, to create new traditions.
CHESSENE: Not quite alone, Dastari.
DASTARI: He calls humans primitive.
CHESSENE: All of our chefs sample the raw flavour of ingredients before even heating their cooking pots.
SHOCKEYE: Does this have a name, Chessene?
CHESSENE: The Do�a Arana knows it as rat.
SHOCKEYE: Rat.
CHESSENE: It is a scavenging animal.
SHOCKEYE: Hmm. Oh, the flesh is rank. Smoke-dried it might just be tolerable.
DOCTOR: Boing! The largest of the twenty five bells in the cathedral at Seville. Most distinctive.
PERI: You certainly specialise in arcane knowledge.
DOCTOR: Of course. Now we know the area where they're holding me. Now, it was in the distance. About three miles, I should judge. Have you been to Seville, Peri?
PERI: No, have you?
DOCTOR: How else would I know the Santa Maria when I hear it? Oh, do try and use your brain, my girl. Small though it is the human brain can be quite effective when used properly.
PERI: You might be wrong.
DOCTOR: I am not wrong. Now, this station was attacked ten or twelve days ago. In hyperdrive a Sontaran cruiser would take that long to reach Earth. It can only just have reached there.
DOCTOR: Ah, you look better for your change of clothes and bath. You should try it more often.
JAMIE: Thank you. What?
PERI: Ignore him, Jamie. He's being crotchety. I think you look wonderful.
DOCTOR: I am not crotchety. I'm just, well, concerned.
JAMIE: What about?
DOCTOR: About myself, chiefly. I mean, him. Languishing in some dark dungeon at the mercy of the Sontarans.
PERI: You can't be sure he's in a dungeon.
DOCTOR: There was an echo, an after resonance. When you've been locked in as many dungeons as I have, you wouldn't fail to recognise it. Well, are you ready?
JAMIE: For what?
DOCTOR: Transference.
DOCTOR: Huh.
JAMIE: Now my Doctor wouldna have done that.
DOCTOR: Your Doctor is an antediluvian fogey. Allowing himself to be captured by the Sontarans. If anything happens to myself as a result of it I will never forgive himself.
PERI: Oh, I do wish you'd stop switching personal pronouns. It'd make it a lot easier to understand what you're talking about.
DOCTOR 2: Oh. Good morning.
DASTARI: Don't try to move yet, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Dastari?
DASTARI: You'll feel dizzy for a time.
DOCTOR 2: So, I've been drugged, have I? What did you use? It feels like one of the anomode group.
DASTARI: Absolutely right. Siralanomode.
DOCTOR 2: Siralanomode? That effects the memory.
CHESSENE: We're not interested in your memory.
DOCTOR 2: Haven't I seen you somewhere before? Oh, augmented Androgum.
DOCTOR 2: Oh, I don't think much of the company you keep, Dastari.
VARL: Attention! Group Marshal Stike of the Ninth Sontaran attack group.
STIKE: Stand at ease.
CHESSENE: We already were, Stike. And tell that underling of yours not to shout every time you appear.
STIKE: Yes, Major Varl, the Androgum is quite right. We shall treat you as equals for the time being.
VARL: Very good, sir.
DOCTOR 2: Sontarans. I remember now. The space station. But I had someone with me. Jamie. What have you done with Jamie?
CHESSENE: Your companion will be long since dead, Doctor. The Sontarans take no prisoners.
STIKE: Inflexible policy.
DOCTOR 2: No! No!
CHESSENE: Fasten the restraints.
DOCTOR 2: Jamie! No!
DOCTOR 2: Oh, poor old Jamie.
OSCAR: Isn't that incredible? Police! And they say they're never there when you need them.
ANITA: Oscar, it doesn't say Polic�a.
OSCAR: Interpol, my dear. They have branches everywhere.
ANITA: Oscar, you are a fool.
OSCAR: Officer! We have to report a tragedy. Stark disaster has struck this simple countryside.
DOCTOR: Has it indeed? What manner of disaster, Mister?
OSCAR: Botcherby. Oscar Botcherby at your service, sir, and this dark-eyed naiad is named Anita.
ANITA: Oh, come on, Oscar. There's been a plane crash.
OSCAR: Well, of course, it may not be your department. I can see from your raiment that you obviously belong to the plain clothes branch.
DOCTOR: Did you see this aeroplane?
OSCAR: No, we were in an olive grove at the time it roared overhead. We were on a moth hunting expedition. Are you interested in Lepidoptera at all?
DOCTOR: I am interested in everything, Mister Botcherby, but mainly, at the moment, in this crash you heard.
ANITA: It landed near Do�a Arana's hacienda. We saw three survivors staggering towards to the house.
OSCAR: Well, two of them were carrying someone other poor injured fellow.
DOCTOR: Were they, indeed? I think you may well have done me a great service, Mister Botcherby.
OSCAR: In what way, officer?
DOCTOR: I think you saw three fugitives, whose trail we have been following for a long time. Perhaps you can lead us to this hacienda?
ANITA: Of course. It's this way.
OSCAR: Should we, my dear? It's easy to find, officer. You just follow this road.
ANITA: Oh, it's not easy to find, Oscar. We ought to show them.
OSCAR: I was thinking these men might be dangerous. I mean, I was thinking we ought to be getting back to the restaurant.
ANITA: Oh, we've plenty of time.
DOCTOR: You'll be doing a public service, Mister Botcherby.
OSCAR: Oh well, we Botcherbies have never shirked public service. My dear departed father was an air raid warden in Shepton Mallet throughout the war. He slept in a steel helmet for five years. This way.
DOCTOR 2: What have you got there?
DASTARI: The Kartz-Reimer transference module.
DOCTOR 2: Well, that'll never work. I can tell that from here.
DASTARI: It worked well enough to bring you to the Space Station, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: All it did was to produce a few hiccups in the time continuum. Enough to tell us that dangerously crude experiments were going on.
DASTARI: Kartz and Reimer were clearly on the right track. Several Androgums successfully vanished into time during those experiments. Unfortunately we were unable to bring them back.
DOCTOR 2: Course you couldn't. No one can travel through time without a molecular stabilisation system.
DASTARI: We know that now. And we know that Time Lords possess a symbiotic link with their machines which protects them, and anyone with them, against destabilisation.
DOCTOR 2: Guess work.
DASTARI: Don't underestimate Chessene, Doctor. Hers was the brain behind Kartz and Reimer, and it was she who first realised that the missing element had to lie somewhere in here.
DOCTOR 2: So what are you going to do, hmm? Cut me up piece by piece?
DASTARI: Let us say cell by cell, and gene by gene, until I isolate the symbiotic nuclei.
DOCTOR 2: When did you go mad, Dastari?
DASTARI: I assure you I am not at all mad.
DOCTOR 2: Then you're totally under Chessene's domination. Are you hoping to give her the power of time travel? Is that the idea?
DASTARI: I shall put her among the gods. There need be no limit to her achievements.
DOCTOR 2: There'll be no limit to her capacity for evil. She's an Androgum, Dastari, whatever you may say! She'll snap off the hand that feeds her whenever she feels hungry.
DASTARI: You don't know Chessene. I confess I was sad that the Time Lords chose to send you as their emissary, because I've always had a certain regard for you, Doctor, personally, and the operation will, by necessity, be very painful. But
DOCTOR 2: It'll hurt you more than it hurts me.
DASTARI: What gives you that idea? No, I was going to say but at least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you have been part of a great undertaking.
DOCTOR 2: You are an irresponsible old fool! The Androgums are barbarians! Release them into time and every civilised people in the galaxy will curse your name! Do you hear me? Oh, my giddy aunt. Oh, crumbs!
STIKE: Dastari, why this delay?
DASTARI: Delay?
STIKE: I expected the operation to begin immediately on my arrival. Time is being wasted.
DASTARI: Time is not being wasted. An operation of this complexity needs careful preparation.
STIKE: You are not efficient. All that should have been done.
DASTARI: We brought most of this equipment with us. How could it have been installed before we got here?
STIKE: Chessene should have brought it. There was no forward planning.
DASTARI: If we had dismantled my operating theatre any earlier, the station would have been buzzing with speculation. Chessene's plan might have failed. It was not worth the risk.
STIKE: How long is this operation going to take?
DASTARI: As long as it takes me to locate the symbiotic nuclei within the Time Lord's cell structure. Hours or days. I cannot say.
STIKE: Every hour is precious to me, Dastari. My Ninth group is now forming up for a vital battle in the Madillon Cluster. If successful, it could change the course of the war, so it is imperative that I must be there to lead them to victory.
DASTARI: Then if time is so important, I suggest you take this to the operating theatre while I fetch the rest of my equipment.
DOCTOR 2: Tea time already, nurse?
STIKE: I do not understand.
DOCTOR 2: Just as well. A face like yours wasn't made for laughing.
STIKE: The operation must begin at once. I am needed at the front.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, I heard you. What was it, a vital strike in the Madillon Cluster? Oh, dear me. Nothing changes, does it? You and the Rutans have become petrified in your attitudes.
STIKE: Nothing can change till victory is achieved. But, but I fear I might have made a tactical error.
DOCTOR 2: Oh? I thought the Sontarans never made mistakes.
STIKE: It is not easy being commander. The loneliness of supreme responsibility.
DOCTOR 2: Why don't you resign, Stike? Take a pension.
STIKE: When I die, it will be alongside my comrades at the front.
DOCTOR: Wait here.
PERI: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Just for a scout round.
OSCAR: Oh, look!
JAMIE: What?
OSCAR: Over there.
JAMIE: I don' see anything.
OSCAR: Just there. An exquisite Feathered Gothic. If only I'd brought my net.
STIKE: Doctor, you have a chance, in death, to help the Sontaran cause.
DOCTOR 2: How can I do that?
STIKE: Tell Dastari where your symbiotic nuclei is located in your cell structure. Vital time will be saved and I can be on my way.
DOCTOR 2: Is that what Chessene's offered you, the knowledge of unlimited time travel? In that case, you should watch your back, Stike.
STIKE: What?
DOCTOR 2: She's an Androgum! A race to whom treachery is as natural as breathing. They're a bit like you Sontarans in that respect!
STIKE: That is for the slur on my people!
DOCTOR 2: And for that I demand satisfaction!
STIKE: You know that is impossible.
DOCTOR 2: I am challenging you to a duel, Stike. That is traditional among Sontarans, is it not?
STIKE: Oh, I would dearly love to kill you, but unfortunately you are needed alive.
DOCTOR 2: Release me, Stike. You are not only without honour, you're a coward as well.
STIKE: As you are not a Sontaran, Doctor, you cannot impugn my honour.
DOCTOR 2: Well, that didn't work, did it?
CHESSENE: What have you got there, Shockeye?
SHOCKEYE: A selection of recipes, madam, used by these humans. It's most interesting.
CHESSENE: I cannot think that Shockeye o' the Quauncing Grig has anything to learn from humans. Do you understand it?
SHOCKEYE: Oh yes, indeed. These are Chinese and these are Spanish. The ingredients are unfamiliar, naturally, but the general principles are similar to our own methods. They cannot be quite as primitive as I'd believed. In many ways they resemble us.
CHESSENE: In what ways?
SHOCKEYE: Well, I found many of these books here. Now, there cannot be a creature on the planet that humans do not kill and eat. Many beasts are bred especially for table. They are force-fed to improve the flesh, and penned in small, confined quarters to fatten more rapidly. It's fascinating.
SHOCKEYE : Vats of boiling liquid.
SHOCKEYE: The strange thing, however, is that I can find no recipes for cooking the human animal.
CHESSENE: There are races that do not eat their own kind.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, but a species that is at the top of the food chain as these
SHOCKEYE : Creatures are, must develop the finest flavour of all. They have the pick of the planet's resources and all that goodness is concentrated
CHESSENE : Listen!
DOCTOR: Ow.
CHESSENE: I heard something out there.
SHOCKEYE: I heard nothing, Chessene.
CHESSENE: You were too busy talking about your favourite subject.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, I must taste a Tellurian soon. A young one, with a good proportion of meat to the bone. I am becoming insane for such a feast.
CHESSENE: Be patient, Shockeye.
CHESSENE: We'll find one for you before we leave Earth. Indeed, I'll join you at table, for I confess to a certain curiosity myself.
PERI: So, you're an actor.
OSCAR: For my sins.
JAMIE: What're you acting in in the moment, Oscar?
OSCAR: I'm between roles at the moment, so I'm managing a restaurant for a friend of mine. Las Cadanas in the Bario Santa Cruz.
ANITA: Quiet, Oscar. Someone's coming.
PERI: Oh, Doctor, you scared us. Do you have to creep up like that?
DOCTOR: You were expecting a brass band?
JAMIE: Did you find out anything?
DOCTOR: No, but the Sontarans are here. I can sense their presence.
OSCAR: Who are the Sontarans?
JAMIE: Don't ask. Just hope you don't meet one.
DOCTOR: Anita, this Do�a Arana, is she tall and dark?
ANITA: No, she's small and frail and has white hair.
DOCTOR: Oh, it wasn't her then. I couldn't see the man she was with. He had his back to me so I couldn't tell if he was human or not.
OSCAR: What do you mean, human or not?
DOCTOR: That noise you heard was a spacecraft landing. That hacienda is now in the possession of what you would term as alien beings.
OSCAR: You are joshing me, officer, are you not?
DOCTOR: Joshing?
JAMIE: That woman, was she wearing a long grey frock?
DOCTOR: Couldn't have put it better myself.
JAMIE: Well, she was at the Space Station, then.
DOCTOR: Was she now?
JAMIE: Aye. Dastari said she was a hungryman or something.
DOCTOR: Androgum?
JAMIE: Aye, that's it.
DOCTOR: Of course! Though her features haven't the heaviness of the typical Androgums.
JAMIE: Oh, he said he'd done some operations that had turned her into a genius.
DOCTOR: What a stupid thing to do!
JAMIE: That's what the Doctor said.
DOCTOR: And I was right. Whatever he's done to her mind, her nature will stay exactly the same, and Androgums have as much emotional capacity as, as a gumblejack.
PERI: Well, what's the next move, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We have to find a way of getting into that hacienda without being detected.
ANITA: I know a secret way into the cellars. It used to lead from the old ice house.
DOCTOR: The cellars? That's even better. Peri, you'll have to cause a distraction while Jamie and I try and find out where I'm being held.
PERI: What sort of distraction?
DOCTOR: Do I have to think of everything? Knock on the door and say you're lost.
PERI: I don't speak Spanish.
DOCTOR: That's all right. Neither do they. Right, Anita, you'd better show us this ice house.
PERI: What if a Sontaran answers the door?
DOCTOR: Oh, that's not very likely. They seem to be keeping well out of the way at the moment. Come on. Lead on.
OSCAR: Good luck, everyone.
DASTARI: I'm afraid I'm unable to give you a full anaesthetic.
DOCTOR 2: Doing the job on the cheap, are you?
DASTARI: You have to be conscious while the neuron bombardment excites the brain cells. I will then be able to examine them.
DOCTOR 2: You should be examining your own brain cells, Dastari, Most of them must have leaked out your ears or you wouldn't be involved in this madness.
DASTARI: This injection will simply inhibit the motor centres.
STIKE: Get on with it, Dastari. You're delaying my war effort.
DASTARI: If you want this operation to succeed, Group Marshal, you will allow me to proceed as I decide and at the pace I consider appropriate. Count backwards from ten, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Certainly not.
DASTARI: As you wish.
DOCTOR 2: Do you expect me to cooperate in my own murder? I'm domni oik parl.
DASTARI: The next step is partially to detach the occipital bones.
PERI : Hello?
CHESSENE: Wait!
PERI : Is anybody there?
ANITA: Shall I come with you?
DOCTOR: No, you've done quite enough already bringing us here, Anita. I want you to collect Oscar and get off the estate as fast as you can.
JAMIE: Er, Anita? Goodbye.
ANITA: Good luck.
CHESSENE: American students?
PERI: Yes. We're planning to send parties every year and I'm surveying the district for suitable accommodation.
PERI: Can I ask, do you live alone or are there other occupants?
CHESSENE: I live alone, apart from my servant. Wait here, young woman.
SHOCKEYE: We could eat her tonight. I could make a piquant sauce.
CHESSENE: Perhaps we shall, but first I must test my suspicions.
SHOCKEYE: What suspicions?
CHESSENE: The human mind is so flabby and vague it is hard to read, but she was constantly thinking of the Doctor.
SHOCKEYE: Eh?
CHESSENE: The Doctor.
SHOCKEYE: But she could have no knowledge of the Doctor. How would that be possible?
CHESSENE: We shall see. Have Dastari bring him through the hall. If there is a connection, she will give herself away when she sees him.
SHOCKEYE: And then we can cook her.
DOCTOR: Mind how you go, Jamie. This ladder seems a ow!
JAMIE: A wee bit rickety. Is that what you were going to say, Doctor?
DASTARI: You heard what Shockeye said. Chessene wants him taken upstairs.
SHOCKEYE: Her orders were quite clear.
STIKE: And I am ordering you to continue the operation. I will not tolerate further delay.
DASTARI: Force will get you nowhere, Stike. If you kill me you lose all chance, forever, of learning the Time Lords' genetic secret.
STIKE: Very well. But tell Chessene if the operation is not completed by the end of the day, I shall return to my unit and leave none of you alive here. Varl!
VARL: Sir. 
DASTARI: Militaristic buffoon.
SHOCKEYE: Chessene will deal with him. Have you ever eaten a Sontaran?
DASTARI: Certainly not.
SHOCKEYE: No, nor have I. They always seem so tough and tasteless.
DASTARI: Here, help me lift him into the wheelchair.
JAMIE: Are we not going after them?
DOCTOR: Let's have a good look round here, first.
JAMIE: But there's only two of them. We could easy
DOCTOR: One of them's an Androgum, Jamie. He could break us both in half with one hand.
PERI: And, er, how many bedrooms?
CHESSENE: Seven.
PERI: I thought you said you lived alone?
CHESSENE: Visitors.
CHESSENE: Take him through.
PERI: Is he all right?
CHESSENE: He has had rather a tiring time lately.
SHOCKEYE: Madam?
CHESSENE: Shockeye, show this young woman around. She might be particularly interested in the kitchens.
SHOCKEYE: With pleasure, madam.
PERI: Er, well, thank you, I think I have all the information I need.
SHOCKEYE: Come.
PERI: Well, my friends'll be waiting for me.
CHESSENE: If she has friends they will come enquiring after her.
SHOCKEYE: I think that was a lie. Animals always scent danger. They have to be dragged to the abattoir!
DOCTOR: They've got it almost exactly right, even down to the Briode Nebuliser. Look.
JAMIE: What is it?
DOCTOR: The Kartz-Reimer version of the Tardis.
JAMIE: A Tardis?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
JAMIE: Will it work?
DOCTOR: It will if I use it, or any other Time Lord, but not for anyone else.
JAMIE: Why not?
DOCTOR: This machine has to be primed, by what we call the Rassilon Imprimatur, that's a kind of symbiotic print within the physiology of a Time Lord. Once that's been absorbed into the Briode Nebuliser you have a time machine that anyone can use. That, of course, was what they didn't understand. They simply copied the technology, without realising that old Rassilon had a second trick up his sleeve.
STIKE: A most interesting lecture, Time Lord.
PERI: Ow!
SHOCKEYE: Pretty, pretty. Here, my pretty one.
Part Three
SHOCKEYE: Steady, my little beauty. Come to Shockeye.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, whoa, whoa. Oh, what a fine, fleshy beast. Ha! Just in your prime, and ripe for the knife!
SHOCKEYE: Oh, pity it's not a jack. Still.
STIKE: Varl! Inform Chessene that we have another Time Lord for our collection.
VARL: Very good, sir.
STIKE: I am Group Marshal Stike, Commander of the Ninth Sontaran Battle Group.
DOCTOR: A long way from the war, aren't you, Stike? Going badly, is it?
STIKE: On the contrary. And thanks to the information you've just given me, I shall be back in time for the crucial battle.
DOCTOR: My money's still on the Rutans.
STIKE: Into the machine, Time Lord. 
DOCTOR: Why? Oh, of course. You don't really expect me to give the Sontarans the power of unlimited time travel, do you?
STIKE: Do it, or your comrade dies. Get in!
DOCTOR: Satisfied?
STIKE: So, the machine is now primed?
DOCTOR: Yes.
STIKE: Excellent. I shall now execute your comrade.
DOCTOR: Wait! Now, that's why you Sontarans have no allies. You can't be trusted.
STIKE: We have no need of allies. Sontaran might is invincible!
DOCTOR: Run, Jamie!
CHESSENE: Who has done this to you, Stike?
STIKE: A Time Lord.
CHESSENE: Impossible. How could the Time Lords have traced us?
STIKE: It's the truth. I did not do this to myself!
DASTARI: The Doctor's companion at the Space Station had a knife like that.
JAMIE: Doctor!
DOCTOR 2: Jamie! There you are, Jamie.
DOCTORS: Snap!
DOCTOR: I've come a long way for you!
DOCTOR 2: Naturally. Don't expect any thanks.
JAMIE: I think someone's coming.
JAMIE: Too late!
DOCTOR: Upstairs. Extemporise.
SHOCKEYE: Wake up, old Time Lord. Supper will soon be served.
CHESSENE: They've escaped.
STIKE: Typical cowardice.
CHESSENE: They'll come back. They have to. Dastari, you come with me. Stike, you and Varl search the area.
STIKE: That Androgum has given its last order.
VARL: Sir?
STIKE: I have outwitted Chessene. The Time Module is now fully operational, Major Varl, so you and I can return to our unit.
VARL: Excellent news, sir.
STIKE: Come!
CHESSENE: Now that the Time Lords have located us, Dastari, we must move quickly.
DASTARI: The operation cannot be hurried, Chessene.
CHESSENE: I'm aware of that, but I have a contingency plan. It's been in my mind for some time.
DASTARI: What contingency plan?
CHESSENE: I want you to turn this Time Lord into an Androgum. You could do that, I know.
DASTARI: Well, if I had the genetic material.
CHESSENE: Take it from Shockeye.
DASTARI: Shockeye?
CHESSENE: I want you to make a consort for me. Leave him the power of time travel, leave the symbiotic nuclei within him, but turn him into an Androgum by blood and by instinct. How long would that take?
DASTARI: Not long: two simple operations. The first to implant the genetic material, and then a second operation to stabilise his condition.
CHESSENE: Good. Then that is what we shall do.
CHESSENE : Shockeye!
CHESSENE: I want you to help Dastari get the Doctor back to the operating theatre.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, can't I trim the beast first, madam? It'll only take a few minutes.
CHESSENE: Later, Shockeye. Dastari wants to operate immediately.
SHOCKEYE: Oh, if you say so.
STIKE: Orders.
VARL: Yes, sir?
STIKE: Return to the craft and contact Sontaran High Command. Report that we have possession of a functioning Time Space machine. Request permission to use it to rejoin our unit at the Madillon Cluster.
VARL: Yes, sir.
STIKE: That done, set the craft to self-destruct. I intend to leave no one alive here.
DOCTOR 2: No! You know what this precious pair have cooked up for you, Shockeye?
DASTARI: That's enough.
DOCTOR 2: No! I don't want to be turned into an Androgum!
SHOCKEYE: Chessene!
PERI: Ugh!
DOCTOR: Peri, can you stand?
PERI: Oh, my head. What happened?
DOCTOR: Can you stand?
PERI: Yes, I think so.
DOCTOR: Come on, then. Let's get out of here.
CHESSENE: How long?
DASTARI: A few minutes only. It's essentially the same operation I performed many times on you.
CHESSENE: But this time in reverse. This time you are taking from an Androgum, rather than augmenting one.
DASTARI: The principle's no different. What will you do when Stike discovers the plan's been changed?
CHESSENE: I have no further use for Stike. He and his underling must be destroyed.
JAMIE: What now? They've still got the Doctor.
DOCTOR: And they're turning him into an Androgum.
JAMIE: How long will it take?
DOCTOR: You heard Dastari, two operations. I thought Stike would have acted by now.
PERI: How?
DOCTOR: I mean, he has a functioning time machine. I would expect him to try and kill both Chessene and Dastari before he leaves, so why isn't my plan working?
JAMIE: Your plan?
DOCTOR: Jamie, you don't think someone of Stike's build can sneak up behind me without my hearing him, do you?
JAMIE: You knew he was there?
DOCTOR: That's why I said what I did. None of it was strictly true, but he believed it because I was talking to you.
JAMIE: But the machine worked. I saw it.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it worked for me, but it won't work for him because I have the Briode Nebuliser.
DASTARI: I've given the Time Lord a fifty percent Androgum inheritance. Within an hour that will become the dominant genetic factor. I can then stabilise his cell structure.
CHESSENE: Before then we must deal with the Sontarans.
DASTARI: How?
CHESSENE: Coronic acid kills them.
DASTARI: We have no coronic acid.
CHESSENE: I took the precaution of having three canister prepared before we left the station, just in case.
SHOCKEYE: Chessene, you have betrayed me. You have fouled the blood of the Quauncing Grig.
DOCTOR 2: Capercaillies in brandy sauce.
SHOCKEYE: What?
DOCTOR 2: With a stuffing of black pudding made of live pig's blood, herbs, and pepper. And the breasts of the birds should be slit and studded with truffles.
SHOCKEYE: You know the cuisine of this planet?
DOCTOR 2: Of course I do. I have eaten pressed duck at the Tour d'Argent. They are fed only on corn, fruit pulp and molasses. They're exquisite, Shockeye. Why am I thinking of food?
SHOCKEYE: Because you are now an Androgum. Can you lead me to one of these eating places to sample the local dishes?
DOCTOR 2: Of course I can, but you will need proper clothes.
SHOCKEYE: Proper clothes?
DOCTOR 2: A collar, a neck tie, at least.
SHOCKEYE: Oh. I know where there are clothes.
DOCTOR: Action, I think.
DASTARI: Stike, Varl, this way.
STIKE: Not yet. Chessene first. She's more dangerous.
STIKE: What is it, Dastari?
DASTARI: The Time Lord has returned. We saw him from the house.
STIKE: Where is he?
DASTARI: He's entered the passage. Chessene's waiting in the cellar. Now, if you go in this way, we have him trapped.
DOCTOR: A double double-cross. It gets more interesting by the minute.
JAMIE: Looks like Chessene's won.
DOCTOR: Yeah
PERI: Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Quail pate, I think, Shockeye, followed by a bisque de crevettes, hmm? I know an eating house
DOCTOR: Now where are they going?
JAMIE: They look quite pally.
DASTARI: Where have they gone?
CHESSENE: They're hunting food.
DASTARI: If the Doctor isn't stabilised within the hour
CHESSENE: He'll reject the transfusion. I'm well aware of that.
DASTARI: We must find them.
CHESSENE: Wait. On this planet there is little hunting. The Do�a Arana remembers many restaurants in Sevilla. That is where they shall be. Come!
STIKE: Treacherous hag. I shall return to destroy this Androgum filth.
SHOCKEYE: Tell me, on this planet, do they ever eat their own?
DOCTOR 2: I believe in the Far Indies it has been known, but I remember a dish, shepherd's pie.
SHOCKEYE: Shepherd's pie? A shepherd. Can't we walk quicker?
DOCTOR 2: Wait. There's a machine coming.
SHOCKEYE: Can you drive this machine?
DOCTOR 2: Of course I can. Get in, my friend. We shall be in Seville in five minutes!
JAMIE: I can't believe that was my Doctor just standing there and letting a man get killed.
DOCTOR: Right now I'm afraid he's eighty percent Androgum. By the time the effect reaches me it will be close to a hundred percent.
PERI: Reaches you?
DOCTOR: And it will, unless we can save him. I'm already beginning to feel changes.
JAMIE: Eh? Well, come on, then.
STIKE: My space craft.
JAMIE: Oh, look, we'll never find him here, Doctor.
PERI: It's too big.
DOCTOR: Look!
DOCTOR: They can't be more than a minute ahead of us. This way, I think.
PERI: How do you know?
DOCTOR: Peri, it is me we're following.
JAMIE: I still don't understand it.
DOCTOR: What?
JAMIE: Well, that you and the Doctor, well, my Doctor are the same person.
DOCTOR: Of course we're the same, but different. You only have to see how my sartorial taste has improved, for instance.
PERI: But how can two of you be together at the same point in space and time?
DOCTOR: When you travel around as much as I do, it's almost inevitable that you'll run into yourself at some point. Come on.
SHOCKEYE: Personally I have never seen the necessity for starting a meal with a, what was your word?
DOCTOR 2: Hors d'oeuvres.
SHOCKEYE: Quite unnecessary, in my opinion. Eight or nine main dishes are quite enough in my opinion.
DOCTOR 2: Well, on this planet it is the custom. All the greatest chefs agree, Carema, Brillat Savaran, the noble Escoffier, they all agree that one should begin with a light dish, something to bring relish to the appetite. Pate du foie gras de Strasburg on croute, for instance, or a serving of Beylon oysters. Even a, even a light salad with artichoke hearts and country ham will suffice. It gets the digestive juices flowing!
SHOCKEYE: How much further is this place?
DOCTOR 2: It's just round the next corner, if I remember rightly.
DOCTOR: They're checking the restaurants. Something I should have thought of. Come on, let's find them before Chessene does.
OSCAR: Juan, can you see to table six.
OSCAR: Welcome to Las Cadenas, se�ors. Oh, how delightful to have see gentlemen of the old school. May I enquire if you have a booking?
SHOCKEYE: Booking? I want food.
OSCAR: No reservation. Well, come this way. Fortunately, I have an excellent table for you.
SHOCKEYE: Do you serve humans here?
OSCAR: Most of the time, sir. Yes, I think I could venture to say that most of our customers are certainly human.
SHOCKEYE: I mean human meat, you fawning imbecile.
OSCAR: No, sir. I'm afraid the nouvelle cuisine has not yet penetrated this establishment. Juan?
JAMIE: No.
DOCTOR: No luck?
PERI: No, just a load of tourists eating paella and chips.
DOCTOR: No, didn't look the kind of place. They'd have gone for somewhere more elaborate.
JAMIE: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: Oh, there's a cat.
PERI: What about it?
DOCTOR: Well, they say there's more than one way to cook a cat. Here, pussy, pussy, puss-puss! Here, little puss.
PERI: Doctor, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: They can make quite good eating. Small mammals are quite flavoursome when baked.
PERI: What are you saying? I don't understand.
DOCTOR: I knew it would happen. I'm turning into an Androgum.
PERI: You can't!
JAMIE: You're not an Androgum. You're a Time Lord! Pull yourself together, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, that's right. I'm a Time Lord.
JAMIE: Are you better now?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, yes, I'm all right. For the moment.
OSCAR: What on Earth have they had? Nobody can run up a bill for eighty one thousand, six hundred pesetas.
ANITA: What? Let me see. They've had lobsters, clams, and squid, brains in white sauce, two whole suckling pigs, a ham with figs, eight steaks, and an entire family paella!
OSCAR: A whole paella?
ANITA: And
OSCAR: That's twelve servings.
ANITA: They've just ordered a dozen breasts of pigeons, probably to help down the last of their dozen bottles of wine.
OSCAR: What a gargantuan repast. It's incredible. And they're still eating!
DOCTOR: They've covered that way, so we'll go this.
ANITA: I think they should start paying now, Oscar.
OSCAR: Yes. Well, leave it to me.
OSCAR: I trust everything was to your satisfaction, gentlemen?
SHOCKEYE: Oh, tolerable, tolerable.
OSCAR: May I say what a pleasure it has been to see two such dedicated trenchermen enjoying their food. Unfortunately the reckoning is rather high.
SHOCKEYE: What is this?
OSCAR: Well, it's the amount you owe, sir.
SHOCKEYE: Do you understand this?
DOCTOR 2: He is asking for money.
SHOCKEYE: Money?
DOCTOR 2: Tokens of exchange.
SHOCKEYE: This is our tally?
OSCAR: Yes, sir.
SHOCKEYE: Ah.
SHOCKEYE: Here. Keep the change.
OSCAR: I'm sorry, sir. I mean, I can see you're a wit as well as a bon vivant, but this, whatever it is, is not acceptable.
SHOCKEYE: That is a twenty narg note! You can change that anywhere in the Nine Planets!
OSCAR: Well, it's not acceptable here, sir.
PERI: Las Cadenas. 
DOCTOR: Las Cadenas. 
PERI: Well, isn't it where Oscar works?
JAMIE: Aye, I think that was the name. Mind you, there seems to be more places to eat in this town than you'd find fleas on a dog.
DOCTOR: Dog? Where?
ANITA: Oscar, you must stop them.
OSCAR: Yes. Yes, I must.
OSCAR: Gentleman, if this is a joke, it has gone on long enough. If you don't wish to pay cash we can accept any recognised credit card.
SHOCKEYE: I will pay you with this.
OSCAR: What?
SHOCKEYE: Your whining importunacy has acidised my digestive juices.
PERI: Oscar!
DOCTOR: What happened?
OSCAR: Officer. Promptly on the scene as always.
DOCTOR: Let me see that.
OSCAR: Ridiculous thing to happen. Dissatisfied customers usually just don't leave a tip.
PERI: Doctor?
ANITA: You're going to be all right, Oscar. I phoned for the ambulance and the Guardia Civil.
OSCAR: No, no, I'm afraid this is Botcherby's last curtain call.
ANITA: Oh, no.
OSCAR: No one will ever see my definitive Hamlet now.
PERI: We will! We'll all be there on the first night, Oscar.
ANITA: Yes.
OSCAR: To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream. Where are you, Anita?
ANITA: I'm here.
OSCAR: Please, take care of my beautiful moths.
DOCTOR: Good night, sweet prince.
JAMIE: Doctor, just look at the Doctor. His face.
DOCTOR: Can you walk?
DOCTOR 2: Walk? Of course I can walk.
DOCTOR: Right. Come on.
DOCTOR: I am a police officer. Come along with me, sir.
DOCTOR 2: What is this?
DOCTOR: Anything that you may say
DOCTOR 2: Who do I think you are?
DOCTOR: May be used in evidence against you.
JAMIE: We'd better go.
DOCTOR: Now you come along with me!
DOCTOR 2: How dare you! Let go of me!
DOCTOR: This way!
DOCTOR 2: No, this way.
DOCTOR: Now look, you got me into this mess.
PERI: Will you two please stop squabbling? We'll go this way.
CHESSENE: No. You'll come this way. We have some unfinished business to attend to.
DOCTOR 2: Oh, my word, what a mess.
DOCTOR: Mmm. I think perhaps, Dastari, you ought to sack your chatelaine.
CHESSENE: Shockeye. What has happened here?
SHOCKEYE: It seems that Group Marshal Stike vaporised his space craft and himself. I found this.
DASTARI: So he survived the coronic acid.
CHESSENE: Obviously. Down to the cellars. You know the way, I think.
CHESSENE: The control box has been moved. Is it damaged?
DASTARI: The Briode Nebuliser's missing.
DOCTOR: Do you mean this?
CHESSENE: Why did you remove it?
DOCTOR: Because it contains my symbiotic print.
CHESSENE: Return this to the machine.
DASTARI: How did your Time Lord imprint get into this?
DOCTOR: Stike forced me to prime and use the machine.
CHESSENE: There is a simple way of testing whether you are still trying to deceive us. Come, girl.
JAMIE: No!
SHOCKEYE: Come, girl.
CHESSENE: Now we shall see.
DOCTOR: There you are.
DASTARI: Kartz and Reimer experimented like this many times. The subjects always vapourised into the time stream.
DOCTOR: Peri won't. And she hasn't any symbiotic nuclei, I can assure you.
CHESSENE: Out.
DOCTOR: Satisfied?
CHESSENE: Dastari, chain these creatures up.
DOCTOR: Chain us up? After I've handed you the secret of time travel on a plate. Come on, Chessene. Where's your gratitude?
CHESSENE: Dastari.
DASTARI: Come on. Come along.
SHOCKEYE: Madam, before we leave, let me cook one of the humans.
CHESSENE: Didn't you sate your appetite sufficiently in the city?
SHOCKEYE: A mere snack. You promised we could have a human before leaving Earth.
CHESSENE: Well, if it would please you. Take the one in the skirt. He's the youngest of the jacks.
SHOCKEYE: Thank you, madam.
JAMIE: Get your hands off me!
SHOCKEYE: Steady, my beauty. Oh, there's some juiceful meat on this one, Chessene.
DOCTOR 2: Jamie!
DOCTOR 2: You might at least say goodbye! You're almost as clever as I am.
PERI: What does he mean?
DOCTOR 2: I presume you've sabotaged the Briode nebuliser?
DOCTOR: Pared the interface.
DOCTOR 2: Precisely what I would have done.
PERI: But it worked, didn't it?
DOCTOR: I left a thin membrane so it would work once. I knew she'd want to test it.
DOCTOR 2: There's no need to be so smug. We've got to get Jamie out of that butcher's hands.
DOCTORS: Can you reach that wheelchair?
PERI: I'm not elastic.
DOCTOR 2: I think you could reach it with your feet, if you try.
DOCTOR: Good girl!
PERI: What's the idea, Doctor?
DOCTOR 2: Push it over towards him.
PERI: Why? He's not going anywhere.
DOCTOR 2: Come along.
DOCTOR: That's it!
DOCTOR: What do you think?
DOCTOR 2: It might work. It's worth a try.
DOCTOR 2: That's it. Easy does it.
DOCTOR: Right.
DOCTOR 2: Never mind me. That's Jamie. Help him!
DOCTOR 2: The key!
DASTARI: What are you doing?
SHOCKEYE: Tenderising the meat. Oh, see how the flesh is marbling. That's the fatty tissue breaking up.
DASTARI: You should kill him first, surely?
SHOCKEYE: It works better on a live animal.
DASTARI: It looks very painful.
SHOCKEYE: That's simply a nervous reflex. I've been butchering all my life. Primitive creatures don't feel pain in the way that we would.
SHOCKEYE: Now, this is the part, I always say, where you can tell a butcher from a botcher. The meat should always have a clean edge.
CHESSENE: Dastari, you fool! One of the Time Lords has escaped.
DASTARI: That's impossible.
CHESSENE: You couldn't have fastened the manacle properly.
DASTARI: I tell you I did.
CHESSENE: Don't argue! It's vital that he be caught and killed.
DASTARI: Chessene, listen to me. To kill a Time Lord would mean the destruction of everything we've achieved. The Gallifreyans have powers we've not even dreamed of.
CHESSENE: Kill him, I tell you. Kill him!
SHOCKEYE: This will only take a few minutes, madam. I thought we could have the saddle and the haunches for supper.
CHESSENE: Never mind that now, Shockeye. I want that Time Lord found!
DOCTOR: Jamie? Jamie, can you hear me?
DOCTOR: Jamie, wake up.
SHOCKEYE: I thought you might return to help the primitive.
CHESSENE: Shockeye! The Time Lord.
SHOCKEYE: I know, madam. I wounded him. Look.
CHESSENE: Then follow his blood trail. Kill him, Shockeye.
SHOCKEYE: Certainly, madam.
JAMIE: Right. I'll have that Shockeye, so I will.
DOCTOR 2: Come along, Peri, it's time we were off.
PERI: Okay.
DASTARI: Chessene wants me to kill you.
SHOCKEYE: Your run has nearly ended, Time Lord. Give up, Time Lord, you cannot escape Shockeye o' the Quauncing Grig!
SHOCKEYE: The blood is warm and salt, Time Lord. I know how near you are.
DOCTOR: Your just desserts.
DASTARI : I remember it very clearly, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2 : There speaks the real Dastari.
DOCTOR 2: My old friend!
CHESSENE: I ordered you to kill these two. Why are they still alive?
DASTARI: There's been enough killing, Chessene, and it's my fault. I took an Androgum, a lowly, unthinking creature of instinct, and tried to set her among the gods.
CHESSENE: I put myself among the gods. And now I shall liberate my people. With me as their leader we shall reign over all other beings.
CHESSENE: Stop!
PERI: Is she dead?
DOCTOR 2: Very.
DOCTOR 2: Molecular disintegration. Horrible.
PERI: That's it then.
JAMIE: Aye, except for that Shockeye.
DOCTOR: He's been, er, mothballed. My word, that's a mess! It'll take you a while to put that back together again!
DOCTOR 2: That will not be necessary.
DOCTOR: A Stattenheim remote control? Where did you get that? I've always wanted one of those.
DOCTOR 2: Some of us have earned these little privileges.
DOCTOR 2: Jamie.
JAMIE: Er, after you, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: No, after you, Jamie.
JAMIE: Goodbye, Peri.
PERI: Bye.
JAMIE: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Jamie. Keep an eye on the old gentleman, will you?
DOCTOR 2: Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. Just.
DOCTOR: Do you know, I think I preferred you as an Androgum.
DOCTOR: Of all the conceited ingrates! Do you know, he almost succeeded in concealing my natural charm.
PERI: Was that your Tardis?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
PERI: I don't understand. How can it be in two places at the same time?
DOCTOR: That's the whole point. It's not in two places at the same time. My Tardis is at least five minutes walk from here. After you.
PERI: No, after you.
DOCTOR: No, After you.
PERI: Doctor? We're not going fishing again, are we?
DOCTOR: No. From now on it's a healthy vegetarian diet for both of us.
