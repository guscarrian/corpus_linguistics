Timelash
Part One
PERI: Lost?
DOCTOR: I am never, ever lost.
PERI: Ha! Wish I could have that on tape.
DOCTOR: I was contemplating taking you to the constellation of Andromeda.
PERI: Why?
DOCTOR: I haven't been there recently, that's why.
PERI: Well, what about me? Don't I ever get a say in our destination?
DOCTOR: Oh. Where would the First Lady suggest?
PERI: Well, I don't mind.
DOCTOR: Ha.
PERI: What I mean, Doctor, is I don't mind where we go so long as when we get there, we spend some time and relax.
DOCTOR: You want a holiday! Why didn't you say so before? I know the very place.
PERI: Doctor, if you're about to suggest the Eye of Orion, don't. I've heard all about that elusive place once too often. No one lives there and few visit, apart from you.
DOCTOR: Oh, but such a beautiful moonset. Ideal tonic for the weary time traveller. But, if that doesn't appeal, as I've said, there is always Andromeda.
PERI: Oh, really. And what's out there?
DOCTOR: Some of the most magical sights in the entire universe. Astral starbursts creating a myriad celestial bodies against a timeless royal blue backdrop.
PERI: Very poetic, but that's the exact description you always give of the Eye of Orion.
DOCTOR: It is?
PERI: Word for word.
DOCTOR: Does nothing please you?
PERI: Yes. Purposeful travel, not aimless wanderings.
DOCTOR: Aimless? You see our time together as aimless?
PERI: No, not exactly. I guess not.
DOCTOR: I should hope not. Or perhaps you're trying to tell me you've had enough. In that case I can easily set the coordinates for Earth, 1985.
PERI: No, no, that won't be necessary.
ARAM: We'll have to split up. If just one of us can get out of the Citadel and make it as far as the rebel encampment
TYHEER: Fat chance. There's got to be another way to defeat the Borad from within the Citadel.
ARAM: You please yourself, Tyheer, but I'm getting out. Gazak?
GAZAK: I'm with you. If we stay here and are caught, they'll throw in the Timelash. Shush.
ARAM: Let's go. Good luck.
DOCTOR: That is a Kontron tunnel. Put more colloquially, it's a time corridor in space.
PERI: Didn't the Daleks have one of those?
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter whose tunnel it is, we're heading straight for it and there's nothing we can do about it.
PERI: So? You've always said the Tardis is indestructible.
DOCTOR: Well, that's beside the point. Colliding with a time corridor something one tries to avoid.
PERI: Well, what will it do to us?
DOCTOR: You can never tell with a time tunnel. Ah!
PERI: Are you in pain?
DOCTOR: I've found out where the corridor's going. You're in luck. It's Earth. It's a period you call 1179AD.
PERI: Oh, I've never been to twelfth century Earth.
DOCTOR: As I seem to keep saying, that's beside the point. Once inside a time tunnel, the Tardis may undergo an adverse Kontron effect.
PERI: Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Bad? Bad? Doh. Bad? You don't seem to realise the effect that time particles colliding within a multi-dimensional implosion field can have.
PERI: Hardly.
DOCTOR: Well, the short answer is Pow!
GUARD: Right, loop him up.
GAZAK: No!
BORAD: So, you nearly got away.
ARAM: What are you?
BORAD: The Borad, your master.
ARAM: You can't be.
BORAD: And you have betrayed me.
BRUNNER: Apparently the rebels attacked a storage chamber last night.
KENDRON: Why? Surely they know they can't win?
BRUNNER: As surely as they know the punishment that awaits their failure.
MYKROS: They're bringing up Gazak and Tyheer.
VENA: Tyheer? But Tyheer is a councillor. Mykros, what is going on?
MYKROS: I don't know. Things can't be allowed to continue like this. We are tearing the fabric of our society apart.
VENA: The Borad has promised all of us a better place in which to live. We must trust him.
MYKROS: When we're losing our own friends? What sort of leader never appears in public, only on a screen?
VENA: You know that is a security measure.
MYKROS: Don't be so naive. We never see him because he doesn't care. The only thing that interests the Borad are these endless time experiments.
VENA: He is experimenting for the good of us all. He's a fine leader.
MYKROS: Not only is our planet divided, we are under imminent threat of invasion from our former allies, the Bandrils. Is that good leadership? Why aren't we preparing to defend ourselves? Why are we having a war at all?
TEKKER: Maylin Renis.
RENIS: Have the prisoners brought forward.
TYHEER: Renis, please, I'm not guilty. I led you to the conspirators.
GAZAK: You traitor!
TYHEER: I'm not a traitor, I'm one of you.
RENIS: Be quiet. For organising rebellious acts against our honoured ruler, the Borad, the people of Karfel condemn Gazak and Tyheer to the Timelash.
GAZAK: No!
TYHEER: But I helped you! You can't execute me. Maylin, listen to me, please.
RENIS: Silence him. The Timelash will banish you. The Borad has spared your miserable life.
MYKROS:  I think I prefer death.)
VENA:  What do you mean?
MYKROS:  Who knows where that time corridor ends?
GAZAK: Let me say my last words, Maylin. Please.
MALYIN: Let him speak.
GAZAK: I'm no rebel. I love this planet. My crime is merely a concern for our world, our people, our loss of freedom, and the growing danger of an interplanetary war.
TEKKER: Nonsense. The boy is a self-confessed rebel. Banish him.
GAZAK: No, Maylin, you can't do this. Please!
RENIS: Quiet, quiet. Sentence will be carried out.
TYHEER: Tekker, you must believe me.
TYHEER: Spare me the Timelash and I'll help you fight the rebels, Maylin. Please!
RENIS: Too late, Tyheer.
TYHEER: No, you're making a big mistake. No, I won't go!
BORAD : Let this be a further lesson. I will not tolerate any attempt to interfere with my plans. Furthermore, may I remind you that I'm working for the benefit of all Karfelons. That is all.
MYKROS:  If you believe that, you'll believe anything.
PERI: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
PERI: That curve on the screen you told me to keep an eye on?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
PERI: It's now a straight. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Bad? No, it's disastrous.
RENIS: That is all.
ANDROID: Maylin.
RENIS: I haven't forgotten.
VENA: Father, is that what you now call a fair trial?
RENIS: That is not your concern.
VENA: To the contrary, I think that it is very much
RENIS: Enough. I hope you're taking great care of my only daughter.
MYKROS: Of course. As my future wife, I could hardly do anything else.
RENIS: Then cure her of her stubbornness. She has a foolish commitment to a way of life that is passed.
MYKROS: I hope that she will soon believe as I do.
RENIS: I'm pleased to hear it. Young noblewomen seem to have so much free will nowadays.
VENA: Father
MYKROS: Speaking of noblewomen, Vena tells me that Tola is recovering.
RENIS: My wife is as well as can be expected after such major surgery.
MYKROS: Is there anything that I can do?
RENIS: No, Mykros, but I appreciate your concern. Now, if you will excuse me, I have some urgent business to attend to.
MYKROS: Of course.
DOCTOR: How's that line?
PERI: It's starting to break up.
DOCTOR: Is it still on the screen?
PERI: Just about.
DOCTOR: If any part of it leaves the screen, let me know immediately.
MALYIN: What are you doing in here? You know it's forbidden.
MYKROS: Yes, I'm sorry, Maylin, but I'm afraid my curiosity got the better of me.
RENIS: You do of course realise the penalty if you are caught in here.
MYKROS: Oh, I'm past caring. I want some answers.
RENIS: No one is monitoring us in here. The delta configuration rays would harm delicate instrumentation when I switch power through to the Borad's personal vault.
MYKROS: It's a strange feeling, not being monitored. Wait a minute. Wait a minutes. What would happen if you refuse to make that power switch?
RENIS: Are you mad?
MYKROS: You'd cripple him, surely.
RENIS: You're talking of mass suicide. If we tampered with his power supply, he'd wipe us out within seconds.
MYKROS: Let him try. Look, I know we'd sustain losses, but we'd win through in the end. We must!
RENIS: Do you think I haven't thought of all this already?
MYKROS: Then why haven't you acted? Look, I'd help you. Many would. You wouldn't be alone.
RENIS: It wouldn't work. Not yet.
MYKROS: You're afraid, aren't you. Afraid of some power-crazed old man. That's all he is.
RENIS: You don't know what you're talking about. I am in command.
MYKROS: You're only a figurehead. If you had any real authority, you wouldn't allow loyal citizens to be cast into the Timelash.
RENIS: They were rebels.
MYKROS: They were no more rebels than you or I. Why can't you see what's happening? Karfel is being driven to total destruction and you will not lift a finger to stop it.
RENIS: All I know is that I must continue my role as Maylin. My function is to switch power to the Borad. Either you stay and promise not to interfere, or leave now and let me get on with my duty.
MYKROS: Just what does your duty entail?
RENIS: There are two amulets.
MYKROS: That's a mirror!
RENIS: Yes.
MYKROS: I thought the Borad had banned all mirrors.
RENIS: Only this one remains. The two amulets must be places simultaneously to open the power panels.
MYKROS: What happens next?
MALYIN: We make the necessary power switches according to these instructions.
MYKROS: What's wrong?
RENIS: He wants me to divert all subsidiary energy supplies to his vault.
MYKROS: Everything?
RENIS: All except power for the Timelash.
MYKROS: He's mad!
RENIS: I've no other choice but to obey.
MYKROS: What about those in the hospital? Good heavens, man, your own wife is there on a life support system. You can't! It's murder!
RENIS: Rebelling is useless. We both know that. Perhaps my wife will be strong enough to survive on her own.
MYKROS: I'm going to destroy this madman.
RENIS: All right, I won't stop you.
RENIS : But don't involve me or my daughter.
MYKROS : I suggest you think about your own wife.
RENIS : If you think of yourself.
RENIS: Dead, you're of no use to anyone. Alive, you might just succeed.
RENIS: Good luck.
RENIS: Android. It's all right, he was just assisting me.
ANDROID: Mykros. Return immediately to the Inner Sanctum for an emergency meeting.
RENIS: But shouldn't I have been informed?
ANDROID: Maylin. You are requested to attend the Borad.
DOCTOR: Belt up.
PERI: Where did you get these?
DOCTOR: Does it matter?
PERI: Well, we've never had to use belts before.
DOCTOR: We've never had to negotiate a Kontron tunnel before.
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Peri, it's started.
BORAD: Maylin Renis, how nice of you to accept my invitation.
RENIS: The pleasure and honour is mine, Borad.
BORAD: I was pleased to see that you dealt firmly with the rebels.
RENIS: Thank you.
BORAD: Personally, I would have preferred to see them dangling at the end of a rope.
RENIS: Did I do wrong?
BORAD: Well, perhaps you should have consulted me first.
RENIS: I'm sorry I misunderstood your wishes. I simply went ahead on my own authority.
BORAD: You have no authority. You act entirely under my explicit instructions.
RENIS: But I am the Maylin!
BORAD: From this moment, you are nothing.
RENIS: I don't understand.
BORAD: You think me a fool?
RENIS: But, Borad.
RENIS : All right, I won't stop you, but don't involve me or my daughter.
BORAD: Have you heard enough? You must be wondering how I learnt of your treason. A microphone fitted into the black scented amulet. When inserted into the power panel, it's shielded from delta configuration rays.
BORAD: You look pale, Maylin.
RENIS: You are
BORAD: Repulsive? Perhaps, but I have a hundred times your intellect, the strength of twenty Guardoliers, and a life spanning a dozen centuries.
RENIS: What, what's happening? Where's the Borad?
BORAD: Imbecile. I am the Borad and I do not tolerate disloyalty.
BORAD: Time for another election. Inform Tekker that I have elected him to be the next Maylin.
ANDROID: Yes, Borad.
DOCTOR: Hang on, Peri, we're seconds from impact.
BRUNNER: Fellow council members, may I introduce you to our new Maylin, Maylin Tekker.
VENA: Where's my father?
TEKKER: Oh, please be seated, my dear Vena. Accept the condolences of the entire council of the Inner Sanctum. It appears your father has suffered a fatal seizure.
VENA: No! Why wasn't I told before about this?
TEKKER: My dear Vena, the news grows worse.
MYKROS: Tekker!
VENA: This is madness! What's happening?
TEKKER: It's called treason. And he is the traitor.
VENA: No!
TEKKER: Prepare the Timelash.
VENA: No. No.
MYKROS:  Vena, be brave. It's up to you now. The Borad must be stopped. His strength is in the amulet. The amulet.
TEKKER: My dear Vena, do not distress yourself unduly.
VENA: What has he done?
TEKKER: Conspired with your father to bring about the downfall of the Borad. Get rid of the rebel.
TEKKER: Stop her!
VENA: It must go! Let him go!
TEKKER: Get the amulet!
MYKROS: Vena! Vena!
DOCTOR: It worked. We're still in one piece.
PERI: I feel as though I've been put through a blender.
PERI: What was that? Or did I imagine her?
DOCTOR: No. No, she was real enough.
PERI: Anyone important?
DOCTOR: Didn't get a chance to ask.
PERI: Great. Do you expect any more uninvited guests?
DOCTOR: No. Both the Tardis and the time corridor have now fully stabilised.
PERI: Was she travelling down the time corridor?
DOCTOR: Yes. I only hope she wasn't banking on reaching twelfth century Earth. The Tardis is bound to have deflected her path.
PERI: Well then, we must help her.
DOCTOR: We can hardly help ourselves.
DOCTOR: Velocity override!
PERI: I thought you said the worst was over.
DOCTOR: Did I? She's attempting to materialise.
PERI: Great.
DOCTOR: We must be near the source of the time tunnel.
TEKKER: The Borad is very angry and can you blame him? It's only out of his innate kindness that he hasn't demanded immediate retribution.
KENDRON: How do you mean?
TEKKER: If we don't get the amulet back, he will destroy every Karfelon in the Citadel.
BRUNNER: All five hundred of us?
TEKKER: The androids have already sealed the complex.
BRUNNER: But what will killing us achieve?
TEKKER: Revenge.
KENDRON: What if we blast our way through to the power cells?
TEKKER: And risk triggering an energy chain explosion?
GUARD: Maylin, I'm tracking a moving object in the Timelash vortex.
TEKKER: Could it be Vena?
GUARD: It's some sort of craft, coming up the corridor in reverse.
BRUNNER: But what object can penetrate the Timelash?
TEKKER: The sort we need to retrieve the amulet.
BORAD: It appears the Doctor is attempting a return visit to our planet. I look forward to our reunion.
TEKKER: This could be the answer to our prayers.
KENDRON: My father always talked of the Doctor's return. That is, before the story of the Doctor's visit was ordered erased from our history books.
TEKKER: All that matters now is that the Doctor has arrived.
KENDRON: And he can retrieve the amulet.
BRUNNER: But will he agree?
TEKKER: I'm sure we'll be able to persuade him. 
PERI: A reception committee. Well, they look friendly enough.
DOCTOR: So they should be. I've been here before.
PERI: And where's here?
DOCTOR: Karfel. I was here a regeneration or three back.
PERI: Well, if you've been here before, no problem.
DOCTOR: Except that time corridor. Karfel should be centuries from such technology.
PERI: Doctor
DOCTOR: No. 
Now don't go wandering off until I'm certain this place is clear.
PERI: Yes, sir.
TEKKER: I will do the talking.
TEKKER: Welcome, Time Lord.
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor.
TEKKER: And I am Tekker. Maylin Tekker. We are honoured that you have decided to visit us again after all this time.
DOCTOR: Indeed you are. This is Peri, my assistant.
PERI: Hi.
TEKKER: Only the two of you?
DOCTOR: Yes, travelling light this time. Besides, so difficult to recruit good staff these days, don't you agree? Maylin, about this time corridor in space.
TEKKER: All in good time, Doctor. All in good time. Please enjoy our hospitality first.  Have you been travelling long?
PERI: Well, it's hard to say, really. Time just flies when you're in the Tardis.
TEKKER: Please come in, Doctor.
TEKKER: Oh, our security system. There have been a lot of changes since you were last here.
DOCTOR: So I see.
PERI: Oh, what unusual plants.
DOCTOR: Peri is a bit of a botanist.
TEKKER: Indeed.
PERI: Oh, most unusual.
DOCTOR: Maylin, I'd like to talk to you about
PERI: Ow! Hey, that's mine! What's all that about?
TEKKER: I'm terribly sorry about that. I do hope it didn't frighten you too much.
PERI: I'm more concerned about losing my Saint Christopher.
TEKKER: Yes. I think the android was trying to warn you away from this plant. Although it is a very beautiful specimen, it has the nasty habit of ejecting an acidic fluid into the face of the admirer.
PERI: Well, I'm surprised you have them on display.
DOCTOR: I think perhaps a little re-potting and reprogramming is in order. Don't you, Maylin?
TEKKER: Yes. You could be right.
TEKKER: Ah. Excuse me for a moment, will you?
DOCTOR: Charming fellow.
KENDRON: The Bandril ambassador, Maylin. He has issued an ultimatum.
TEKKER: Has he indeed? Greetings, Ambassador.
BANDRIL : I am commanded by the President's Circle to give you a final opportunity to re-establish the grain supply to Bandril. Food which is rightfully ours.
TEKKER: By what right?
BANDRIL : The Treaty of Cooperation.
TEKKER: That was revoked by the Borad.
BANDRIL : You can't just revoke an intergalactic treaty.
TEKKER: The Borad can, and he has done.
BANDRIL : Tekker
TEKKER: Maylin Tekker.
BANDRIL : We don't want war. We are peaceful people. Our planet is on the verge of famine. Do not give us reason to come and take the grain.
TEKKER: Oh, I assure you, Ambassador, you will find that extremely difficult.
BANDRIL : It appears that diplomacy has failed.
TEKKER: Yes, indeed. Rather like you and your starving planet, Ambassador. 
BANDRIL : Then it seems that we are at war.
TEKKER: Good.
KENDRON: Maylin, you have deliberately provoked an attack!
TEKKER: Of course I have. Do you think the Borad could ever be defeated? Mark my words, soon our planet will rule this corner of the universe with the power of a giant ocean.
KENDRON: With you on the crest of the wave.
TEKKER: You see nothing and you understand less. The Borad wants to defeat them. Their bombs won't even penetrate our solar system, let alone enter our atmosphere. I must find Brunner.
DOCTOR: The place has certainly changed. There's something missing. What is it?
PERI: It's so dull.
DOCTOR: Bored already?
PERI: No. It lacks sparkle. There's no reflection. It's all so matt and lifeless. Even the goblets don't shine.
DOCTOR: Hello.
PERI: Hey.
DOCTOR: Hey, wait a minute.
PERI:  Sezon at the Falchian Rocks.
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon?
PERI: Sezon at the Falchian Rocks. A message.
TEKKER: I have arranged a short tour of the Citadel.
DOCTOR: Splendid.
TEKKER: For your assistant.
PERI: Oh, sounds great, but I'd rather not, if it's all the same to you.
TEKKER: Oh, but it's all arranged. Counsellor Brunner is waiting outside to escort you, and I have so much to talk to you about, Doctor. The time corridor was a brilliant stroke of luck.
DOCTOR: Oh. The Maylin is absolutely right. You go and have a look around. We'll join you when we've had a little chat.
PERI: Doctor, in the Tardis you distinctly said
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind what I said in the Tardis. Off you go. The Maylin and I have important things to discuss, don't we, Maylin.
TEKKER: Yes, Doctor.
BRUNNER: When you've killed the girl, dispose of the body.
GUARD: But where, Counsellor?
BRUNNER: Imbecile. The caves, of course. No doubt the Morlox will make a meal of her.
DOCTOR: And you seriously expect me to believe this preposterous story? That a lady of the Inner Sanctum just happened to fall into a time vortex with a vitally important key to your power vault?
TEKKER: Yes, Doctor, and there's very little time left.
DOCTOR: For what?
TEKKER: For you to retrieve it.
DOCTOR: Retrieve it? You seriously expect me to go through space and time looking for a lost girl and her trinket? Give me one good reason why I should.
TEKKER: Peri.
BRUNNER: This is the west corridor of the central Citadel.
PERI: All these corridors look the same to me. Are these plants indigenous to Karfel?
BRUNNER: Most of them are from Bandril. That's our neighbouring planet. It's also why they require so much special attention.
PERI: They're beautiful.
BRUNNER: Dracowlis. Known as the flower of many faces.
PERI: I can see why.
BRUNNER: Would you excuse me, Peri? I'm summoned away. I'll be back shortly.
PERI: Sure.
PERI: I take it you're not the resident gardener come to do some pruning, huh? Doctor!
ANDROID: The girl has escaped.
BRUNNER: So I see. Still, there's nothing that way but rebels, dank tunnels, and the Morlox. Pity, really. She was an attractive young woman.
ANDROID: Yes, indeed she was.
BRUNNER: On the other hand, perhaps I know where to find her. Come on.
PERI: Beautiful fragrance.
TEKKER: The Doctor is about to leave. Escort him to the Tardis and see that he does.
GUARD: Yes, Maylin.
TEKKER: Good luck, Doctor. For Peri's sake, don't come back empty handed.
DOCTOR: The reason I am doing this, Maylin, is not only to ensure Peri's safety, but the safety and well-being of all on this planet. Something furthest from your mind, I fancy.
GUARD: Move.
HERBERT: What did I say?
VENA: Please, help me.
PERI: Help! Help!
KATZ: What is it?
SEZON: Android. Quick, away from here.
BORAD: A plucky creature who knows how to take care of herself. If she's still alive, I want her brought to me completely unharmed.
SEZON: Who are you?
PERI: I could ask you the same question.
KATZ: She doesn't look like a spy.
PERI: Spy? I've only been on this planet a few minutes.
SEZON: I say we kill her. She must be working for those in the Citadel. She came here to trap us. You saw the android.
KATZ: I also saw that it was on fire.
SEZON: So their plan went wrong. Kill her!
PERI: No! Look, I'm innocent. I haven't done anything to hurt you.
SEZON: Katz, we're wasting time.
KATZ: Wait! You're going to have to tell us everything you know, or he'll insist on killing you. Look, I don't want any violence. I would be willing to let you live if you just told us who sent you.
SEZON: You've got fifteen seconds.
KATZ: Look, if you're not from the Citadel, where are you from?
PERI: You'd never believe me.
KATZ: Well, try me.
PERI: Earth. I came with the Doctor in the Tardis.
SEZON: The Doctor?
PERI: That's right.
SEZON: She must think we're fools. Five seconds.
KATZ: This was given to my grandfather by the Doctor. Do you know who she is?
PERI: I've seen photographs of her, but I've never met her.
SEZON: What's her name?
PERI: Jo Grant. She used to travel with the Doctor.
KATZ: You're right. You still want to kill her?
DOCTOR: 1179 AD. Add a time deflection coefficient of seven hundred and six years, that is 1885 AD.
HERBERT: The talisman's in a purse under your pillow.
VENA: Where am I? And who are you?
HERBERT: My name is Herbert. From your sudden materialisation, I presume you are a spirit from the other side.
VENA: My name is Vena. Thank you for looking after me.
HERBERT: No, the pleasure's all mine. Although I do assume you are from up there, rather than down there.
VENA: It would be more accurate to assume that I am from beyond the stars.
HERBERT: Incredible.
VENA: This is a strange and beautiful land.
HERBERT: Yes, I come up here every summer. The cottage belongs to my uncle. I'm a teacher, or will be next term. I use the place for a bit of peace and quiet. I fancy myself as a bit of a writer, actually, but nothing published yet, of course. When the weather's nice I do the odd bit of fishing on the loch. Perhaps you'd care to join me? But then on the other hand, perhaps spirits from the other side might find fishing a bit mundane.
HERBERT: What on Earth's that?
VENA: They must not get the amulet.
HERBERT: Who mustn't? You mean there's someone else about to materialise? I didn't summon them.
VENA: You must help me.
HERBERT: I'll do all I can.
HERBERT: Right, ridding unwanted spirits. Right, here it is. Right, now stay there.
HERBERT: It's a blue monolith!
DOCTOR: Hello! Have you seen a rather surprised young lady?
HERBERT: Avaunt thee
HERBERT: Foul fanged fiend.
DOCTOR: I can assure you I'm not that long in the tooth, and neat blood brings me out in a rash.
HERBERT: Back from where you came, spirit of the glass.
DOCTOR: Not just yet, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Ah! Now you must be Vena.
VENA: Yes, my name is Vena.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid we left you rather up in the air on our last fleeting encounter.
VENA: It was you in the Timelash?
HERBERT: No, Vena, don't talk to him.
VENA: Why not?
DOCTOR: Yes, why not? I'm the Doctor. Delighted to meet you.
VENA: The Doctor?
DOCTOR: I think you have something
DOCTOR: Which your Maylin would like returned.
PERI: This stuff tastes okay.
SEZON: Enjoy it. It may be our last for some time.
PERI: Why do you hide down here?
KATZ: Because of our ruler, the Borad.
SEZON: Through his lackey, Maylin Tekker, he's provoked war with the Bandrils.
PERI: Why?
KATZ: I don't know.
SEZON: If the Bandrils use a bendalypse warhead, I shudder to think of the consequences. It's a missile so powerful it can destroy anything with a central nervous system, yet leave all buildings standing.
PERI: Sounds familiar.
SEZON: Ironically, it won't kill the Morlox.
PERI: Well, it sort of makes him king of the desolation, won't it?
KATZ: That's the irony.
SEZON: Do you think the Doctor would help us?
PERI: Well, of course, if we could get to him.
KATZ: Sezon, you've got to find a way.
PERI: Are you Sezon? Is this place Falchian Rocks?
KATZ: Yes.
PERI: Well, I had a message. Sezon at the Falchian Rocks.
SEZON: It must be from one of our people in the Citadel.
KATZ: That's right.
PERI: Oh, I didn't understand why he gave it to me. Where did I put it.
GUARD: I wouldn't do that.
PERI: I must have dropped it.
SEZON: Obviously.
DOCTOR: I'm glad you accept my explanation, Herbert.
HERBERT: It's fantastical. A machine that transcends time itself. Can I see it?
DOCTOR: Er, some other time, perhaps. Our first priority is to return the amulet.
VENA: No! The amulet stays here. Mykros warned me the Borad's power depends upon it.
DOCTOR: So do the lives of everyone on Karfel. It must be returned. Trust me. It's the only way to help your people and defeat this Borad of whom you speak.
VENA: I know you saved our planet once before, Doctor, and so I do trust you. Very well, when do we leave?
DOCTOR: I leave immediately. You'll be safer here with Herbert. As soon as Karfel is free again, I promise I'll return for you.
VENA: Doctor, it is my planet, and they are my people. Either you take me back with you now, or the amulet stays here.
DOCTOR: You sound as irritatingly resolute as another young lady I know. Very well, but we must hurry. Goodbye, Herbert. Perhaps I'll allow you to exorcise me another time.
HERBERT: Oh, Doctor, you can't leave me behind after all this.
DOCTOR: We're not going on some joy ride, you know.
HERBERT: But Doctor, I don't care about the risk. I just want to travel in your time ship. Please, you must take me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not.
HERBERT: Please.
DOCTOR: No.
HERBERT: Oh, very well, then. Then goodbye, Vena. I wish we could have got better acquainted.
VENA: Goodbye, Herbert, and good luck.
DOCTOR: Nice enough young fellow, but we must hurry. Have you got the amulet? Good. Remind me to return this mirror to Herbert sometime. Come along.
ANDROID: We have captured the Doctor's companion and some of the rebels at Falchian Rocks.
BORAD: Excellent. Prepare her as ordered and dispose of the others in the Timelash.
ANDROID: It will be done.
BORAD: And when the Doctor returns, make sure you have the Maylin's amulet in your grasp before committing him to the same fate.
VENA: Until recently, our schools taught of your first visit to our planet and your promise to return.
DOCTOR: Promise?
VENA: You do remember?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Never like to forget a promise.
VENA: But the Borad's changed everything. Gradually, he's taking over the entire planet. I was misled like the rest of our leaders. It has already cost my father his life. And Mykros, the man I was to marry, is probably floating in the Timelash now.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about the Borad. I'll deal with him, make no mistake. I show little mercy to time meddlers.
HERBERT: Incredible. It's just incredible.
DOCTOR: What are you doing here?
HERBERT: Just look at this place. I can't believe it. Do you know it's actually bigger inside
DOCTOR: I know.
HERBERT: Than it is on the outside.
DOCTOR: I know! I know!
HERBERT: Do we travel above or below water?
DOCTOR: Do you realise there is an intergalactic law expressly forbidding stowaways?
HERBERT: They'll never believe me. I'm sorry, Doctor. Sorry I tricked you. But I'm not sorry I'm here.
DOCTOR: Since there's no time to take you back, it looks as if we're stuck with you.
HERBERT: I can't believe this is actually happening.
DOCTOR: If you so much as breathe when you shouldn't, or get in my way, I'll lock you up until all this is over, is that understood?
HERBERT: Yes, Doctor, whatever you say.
VENA: It is nice to see you again, Herbert.
VENA: Is it always like this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We're transcending the time vortex. Brace yourselves.
TEKKER: Ah, welcome back, Doctor. Oh, and I'm so pleased to see you again, Vena. Have you got the amulet?
DOCTOR: Where's the Borad? I demand to see him.
TEKKER: Impossible.
DOCTOR: No Borad, no amulet.
TEKKER: Come along, Doctor. Hand over the amulet or I shall be obliged to retrieve it by force.
DOCTOR: Do you realise with whom you're dealing?
TEKKER: Your bravado is all very well, but it won't do much to help you assistant, Peri. I would hate to have to have her put to death.
VENA: Now stop this madness, Tekker. You cannot hope to defeat a Time Lord.
MYKROS: Vena!
TEKKER: Brunner. Prepare the Timelash.
DOCTOR: Where's Peri? You promised her safe return.
TEKKER: Ah, yes. Well, you shouldn't believe everything that people tell you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You gave me your word, you microcephalic apostate. I demand to see the Borad immediately.
TEKKER: Admit defeat, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Never!
TEKKER: The stories I've heard about you. The great Doctor, all knowing and all powerful. You're about as powerful as a burnt out android. Our ruler has finished with you once and for all.
KENDRON: We can't do this, Tekker.
TEKKER: Shut up, or you'll be joining him.
DOCTOR: You're as warped as your dictator friend.
TEKKER: Save your breath for the Timelash, Doctor. Most people depart with a scream.
BRUNNER: The vortex is ready, Maylin.
TEKKER: Despatch the Doctor first.
TEKKER: Goodbye, Doctor. Unpleasant journey. Bwahahahahahaha!
Part Two
VENA: Seal the doors!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mykros.
MYKROS: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right, get those guards next door and tie them up.
SEZON: We're safe. Just let them try breaking in.
DOCTOR: They will, but we must be ready for them.
KATZ: But how?
DOCTOR: We're safe for now, but we must turn this pause to our advantage.
HERBERT: What is this Timelash, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not now, Herbert. Mykros, can you hand me some strong rope or wire?
MYKROS: Yes, right.
VENA: Doctor, what are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Enter the Timelash.
PERI: Ow! You're hurting me.
PERI: Where are you taking me?
GUARD: You'll see.
ANDROID: Borad, what are your instructions?
BORAD: The Guardoliers must apprehend the Doctor and the rebels.
ANDROID: But the Sanctum has been sealed.
BORAD: My time web has the power to disintegrate the doors. Use that.
ANDROID: At once.
BORAD: But the Earth woman must be kept alive.
DOCTOR: Not as long as I'd have liked, but it will have to do.
VENA: Is it safe to enter the Timelash?
DOCTOR: It's our only hope. Without the Kontron crystals, we've got no chance of getting out of here alive.
HERBERT: Let me go, Doctor. You're needed here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Herbert, but no. Those crystals require skilful manipulation. Rough handling could be dangerous. Right, here we go.
KATZ: Good luck, Doctor.
SEZON: He's stopped.
VENA: Doctor! What's the matter?
DOCTOR: The vortex attraction forces are taking effect. Could be tougher than I thought.
HERBERT: Can I come down and help, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, stay where you are! I've almost got this one.
DOCTOR: Mykros, lower me a little. Enough.
MYKROS: Do you want to come out now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not yet. Almost got this one. Gotcha!
VENA: Pull him back!
MYKROS: I can't! The force is too great.
VENA: He's dangling on the edge of oblivion.
HERBERT: Hang on.
SEZON: Katz, come here, quickly!
MYKROS: Take the strain!
SEZON: Come on, pull!
VENA: Careful, Herbert.
KATZ: Careful!
SEZON: Careful, Herbert!
HERBERT: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Get back!
MYKROS: I've got you!
HERBERT: Just a bit further, Doctor. Got him!
KENDRON: The Borad will not be pleased with us.
TEKKER: Stop whining.
KENDRON: I have noticed it is better to die than to fail the Borad.
TEKKER: If you were to die, I don't think anybody would notice the difference.
KENDRON: I say, Tekker!
TEKKER: Maylin Tekker.
TEKKER: Ah, Borad.
BORAD : You do not serve me by arguing.
TEKKER: A frivolous debate concerning protocol.
BORAD : You have time for such things when my Timelash is in the hands of the Doctor and his friends?
TEKKER: We serve as best we can, Borad. As you know, I am not a man of action. The recapture of the Timelash is best left to those trained for such things.
BORAD : You disappoint me. I expected more from you than this.
TEKKER: Your trust is not misplaced. Kendron and I are on our way to see you.
BORAD : For what purpose?
TEKKER: With respect, Borad, a matter best not discussed over an open channel.
BORAD : Very well. Disappoint me and you die.
TEKKER: Of course.
KENDRON: Now what have you said? The Borad will kill both of us.
TEKKER: Oh, I think not. After what I have to tell him, I think he'll be delighted. And while he's smiling, I shall recommend that he appoints you my deputy.
KENDRON: Me?
TEKKER: Yes, Kendron, you.
VENA: Are you all right? Where are the crystals?
VENA: Doctor, did you get the crystals?
DOCTOR: Yes.
VENA: Oh, well done.
KATZ: Well done.
VENA: Yes, indeed.  Well done! And you too, Herbert.
HERBERT: Well, it was nothing.
DOCTOR: When we've stopped congratulating each other, perhaps we can get on.
PERI: At last. Why am I being kept here? And why have I had this contraption fitted to me? Well, can't you speak, dumbo?
PERI: Ow! All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.
TEKKER: What's the matter with you? Don't you want to be recommended as Deputy Maylin?
KENDRON: It all seems a bit sudden.
TEKKER: But you're the perfect choice. You have the right attitude.
KENDRON: What about Brunner?
TEKKER: What about him?
KENDRON: I thought
TEKKER: What?
KENDRON: Nothing.
TEKKER: There you are, you see? I'm right. You have the perfect attitude.
BORAD : What happened, Tekker? Have you failed me as well?
TEKKER: Ah, we were betrayed, Borad.
BORAD : Indeed? By whom?
TEKKER: Kendron. He betrayed us.
KENDRON: No! You're lying. You said I was to be made Deputy Maylin.
TEKKER: Ah, yes. A small ruse, Borad, to put the traitor off his guard.
BORAD : He must be dealt with.
KENDRON: No! No! I have been faithful to you.
KENDRON: What's going on?
BORAD : I will not tolerate infidelity.
KENDRON: Oh, oh please, Borad, believe me. I am not a spy.
BORAD: It would seem I made the right choice for Maylin.
TEKKER: Thank you, Borad.
BORAD: See that you continue to serve me with the same degree of fidelity.
PERI: You're still hurting me. Now where are you taking me?
GUARD: You'll see.
PERI: No, not that creature again! No, please!
MYKROS: Do you want the whole of this panel out, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Every last nut and bolt, if you please.
VENA: What are you making?
DOCTOR: Just a mess at the moment.
HERBERT: Shouldn't we prepare for the attack on this place, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I am.
HERBERT: Well, how are these baubles and crystal balls going to help us?
DOCTOR: You'll see.
HERBERT: But will it work?
DOCTOR: Of course it'll work. I hope.
HERBERT: A small barricade in front of the door wouldn't help?
DOCTOR: Whatever they use to break through that door won't be impeded by a small barricade. Hurry up with that unit, Mykros.
MYKROS: Yes, nearly there.
KATZ: It signalled back to you.
DOCTOR: No, it was the same beam of light.
KATZ: But how could it be? It took all of ten seconds to return.
DOCTOR: Precisely what it's supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Well done.
VENA: I think we could be running out of time.
MYKROS: You may well be right. Doctor?
DOCTOR: Nearly ready. Ah, there we are.
HERBERT: Where?
DOCTOR: Quiet. Pass me that chain.
KATZ: Where's he gone?
HERBERT: Good gracious.
KATZ: Doctor, where are you?
KATZ: What's happening?
VENA: Dematerialisation?
DOCTOR: Not exactly. Kontron crystals have a wide application of uses. I have turned this one into a ten second time break.
SEZON: So, you were travelling in time?
DOCTOR: Not exactly. Do you know, I haven't built one of these in ages.
SEZON: How does it work?
DOCTOR: Well, I time-slipped ten seconds into the future. As I did so, I projected an image of myself.
HERBERT: So we didn't see you, we saw an image of you.
DOCTOR: That's right. If you'd been able to look through this, you would, so to speak, have been able to see both of me at the same time.
HERBERT: But I can't see anything.
DOCTOR: Of course you can't. It only works when this is switched on. Now, when I time slip, you'll be able to see the image I project and the real me ten seconds in the future.
HERBERT: It's science fiction.
DOCTOR: Not quite.
SEZON: Look, this might be a lot of fun for you, Doctor, but how's it going to help us get out of here?
DOCTOR: Ah, that's work for the second crystal. When properly set up, it'll absorb the energy used to break down that door, pass it through a ten second time loop, and feed it back again as a beam of pure energy. Now, that is something we can use against an attacker.
HERBERT: Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
SEZON: Yes, but will it work?
DOCTOR: I think we're about to find out.
VENA: Doctor, look.
MYKROS: It's an invasion force.
SEZON: The Bandrils.
BORAD: Excellent. Soon the only living creatures on this planet will be the Morloxes and myself.
DOCTOR: Argh!
MYKROS: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: I can't set this time loop accurately enough. I was hoping to use the energy absorbed by the machine to project our attackers into the past. As yes, I can't guarantee a change of location as well.
KATZ: How far back into the past, Doctor?
DOCTOR: An hour or so.
KATZ: I wonder.
SEZON: What?
KATZ: Think back to the tunnel when we rescued Peri from the Morlox.
SEZON: You're right. We saw a burning android.
KATZ: Will that be your handiwork, Doctor?
DOCTOR: What?
PERI: Don't leave me here. Please, don't leave me here.
PERI: Help me! Help!
ANDROID: Fire.
VENA: Doctor!
HERBERT: Holy mackerel, it actually works!
DOCTOR: Of course it did. Get down!
MYKROS: It's incredible. I've never seen that before.
DOCTOR: That's me.
HERBERT: You've changed a bit.
DOCTOR: Mmm. Immeasurably for the better, it seems. Strange how you forget what you used to look like.
HERBERT: What does he mean?
VENA: It's a long story, Herbert. No time to tell it now.
DOCTOR: Right, you must all get out of here.
KATZ: Madric's dead and Sezon's wounded.
DOCTOR: There's not much you can do for him here.
KATZ: We can go to the tunnel.
MYKROS: No, the guards could be waiting for us.
DOCTOR: That's a chance you've got to take. When the Borad finds out what's happened here, he'll flood the place with troops.
VENA: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: To find the Borad.
HERBERT: I'll help you.
DOCTOR: No, Herbert. You stay here. Good luck.
MYKROS: Vena, come quickly.
PERI: Doctor, where are you? Help me! Not you.
KATZ: Look at the screen. The Bandrils are coming even nearer!
VENA: There's no point in going to the tunnels now, Mykros. We might as well die with honour here.
MYKROS: Vena. Vena, try not to be so pessimistic. We may still have a chance, if I can just contact them.
HERBERT: Sorry about this, but I was only getting in the way with the others.
DOCTOR: And what makes you think you won't do the same for me?
HERBERT: Look, you won't even notice I'm here, I promise.
DOCTOR: All right. If anything happens to me, you're to find Peri.
HERBERT: Right.
DOCTOR: If she's still alive, she may find a way of getting you home.
HERBERT: Oh no, don't worry about me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm not.
BORAD: So, the Doctor has decided finally to come and see me.
TEKKER: Shall I dispose of him?
BORAD: No. He's an old friend.
DOCTOR: This looks like it.
HERBERT: Grim sort of place.
DOCTOR: Indeed. And this is as far as you go.
HERBERT: Oh, surely you're not going to deny me the highlight of my visit.
DOCTOR: Come any further and your highlight could be a burial in space, with you playing the central part.
HERBERT: Are you sure I can't be of any help?
DOCTOR: If I'm not out in ten minutes, find Peri.
HERBERT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now, find yourself somewhere to hide. Don't want you picked up by the Guardoliers.
HERBERT: Doctor!
DOCTOR: My dear Tekker. Still lurking in other people's shadows. How very typical.
TEKKER: Welcome, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That smell. That bittersweet sickly aroma.
TEKKER: Of Morlox.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. The creatures of the tunnels. I remember now from my last visit. So, your leader is now a Morlox?
TEKKER: No.
DOCTOR: Glad to hear it. From what I remember, the Morlox are not over-endowed with intelligence.
TEKKER: Ah, well, that can hardly be said of our beloved leader, the Borad of Karfel. The most luminous force in this part of the galaxy.
DOCTOR: Really. Not been very bright so far.
BORAD: Neither have you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you could be right.
DOCTOR: And you said your leader wasn't a Morlox?
BORAD: I would guard your tongue, Time Lord.
DOCTOR: What I don't understand is how the people of Karfel have accepted you.
BORAD: My other self.
DOCTOR: How'd you do?
BORAD : How do you do?
DOCTOR: What happened? I don't believe anyone looks like you by design.
BORAD : An agreeable mistake.
DOCTOR: Don't tell me, with Mustakozene Eighty. I noticed the canister hanging on the wall.
BORAD: Precisely. I was once like you, weak of limb and small of mind.
BORAD : Now I have the strength and intelligence of many.
DOCTOR: But hardly the looks to match.
BORAD: Come closer. Now look at me carefully, Doctor. We have met before. Think back of a scientist you once befriended. Later, you reported that scientist to the Inner Sanctum for unethical experimentation on the Morlox creatures.
DOCTOR: Megelen?
BORAD: The very same.
DOCTOR: Your experiments obviously succeeded. Was it worth it?
MYKROS: This is Karfel to Bandril Ambassador. Karfel to Bandril Ambassador. Please respond. It's no good, they're not answering. This is Karfel to Bandril Ambassador. Please respond.
BORAD: Do not make me laugh, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dare. Not when you've got such big teeth. What exactly did happen?
BORAD: During an experiment on a Morlox creature, I was inadvertently sprayed by a canister of Mustakozene Eighty. The smell of the chemical excited the creature I was experimenting upon, and it broke away from its tether.
DOCTOR: It must have made a terrible mess of you.
BORAD: It would appear so.
DOCTOR: And then the M80 caused a spontaneous tissue amalgamation resulting in a combined mutant.
BORAD : Half Karfelon, half Morlox, but with increased longevity and massive intellectual growth.
BORAD: A glorious transformation.
DOCTOR: So you keep saying. I don't agree with you.
TEKKER: Show respect for the Borad.
DOCTOR: Do shut up and go away. There was no glorious transformation. You may have power, but you daren't even show your real face.
BORAD: Not for much longer. Soon the Bandrils will have destroyed all mammalian life on this planet, and then I shall destroy the Bandril ship.
DOCTOR: To become ruler of a barren planet?
BORAD: No, Doctor. To populate the planet with others such as myself.
TEKKER: No.
DOCTOR: It appears you have a lackey with a conscience.
TEKKER: You will not destroy my people. I am the Maylin now. I will not let you.
BORAD: Idiot.
DOCTOR: Time acceleration beam. I don't know whether to be impressed or disgusted.
BORAD : Time Lords to not have a monopoly over the fourth dimension, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Perhaps not. What I don't understand is how you intend to populate this planet with little Borads when you don't even have a mate.
BORAD: That is under control.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't tell me you've got a fat female Morlox with a slinky walk.
BORAD: Not yet. But when I do, her name will be Peri.
DOCTOR: Explain.
BORAD: The creature will attempt to kill her. When it tries to do so, the canister of Mustakozene will burst apart and then she will become as I am.
DOCTOR: Oh, very scientific. I mean, you have a really controlled experiment there. What happens if the Morlox kills Peri before amalgamation takes place?
BORAD: Peri will not die. The Mustakozene not only excites the creature, but will in turn destroy it.
DOCTOR: This is lunacy. What do you hope to gain by creating another miserable mutation like your pathetic self?
BORAD: Choose your next words carefully, Doctor. They could be your last.
DOCTOR: Really. We shall see.
DOCTOR: I think it's time to find your Achilles heel, or should I say flipper?
BORAD: No, Doctor. It's time you grew old, and your ability to regenerate will be of no assistance to you.
BORAD: So, the Time Lord wishes to play games.
HERBERT: Careful, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Where's the control to free Peri?
BORAD: See if you can find it before you die.
BORAD: Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hello, Borad. I wouldn't fire if I were you. If you do, it will be a grave mistake.
BORAD: Your attempted witticisms are beginning to become tedious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I really wouldn't fire. If you do, this crystal will absorb the energy and beam it straight back at you.
BORAD: You're lying.
DOCTOR: I did warn you.
BORAD: Another expedition into the realms of duplicity?
DOCTOR: Six, five, four, three, two, one.
BORAD: No! You've tricked me!
DOCTOR: You tricked yourself.
DOCTOR: Herbert?
HERBERT: Who is it?
DOCTOR: It's me, the Doctor.
HERBERT: Doctor, up here.
DOCTOR: Herbert, you must go to Peri.
HERBERT: Where is she?
DOCTOR: In the tunnels. The passage you're in should lead straight there.
HERBERT: Right.
DOCTOR: Hurry! I'll try and find the release mechanism.
HERBERT: As you say, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Must be here somewhere.
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
DOCTOR: Pelion on Ossa. 
PERI: Help!
HERBERT: Quickly!
PERI: Oh, Doctor, am I pleased to see you.
DOCTOR: The feeling is entirely mutual. Now, come on. We've got to get back to the Inner Sanctum quickly.
PERI: But can't we get out of here?
DOCTOR: We've got a war to stop first.
VENA: Why didn't they listen?
MYKROS: It's no good. We've done everything we can. We must take cover in the tunnels.
DOCTOR: What's happening?
VENA: Too late. The Bandrils have fired their missile.
DOCTOR: This is the Doctor. I say again, this is the Doctor. Please connect me with the Ambassador.
VENA: They don't reply.
DOCTOR: You must respond. I am a Time Lord. I am, in fact, President of the High Council of Gallifrey. Destroy me, you'll have more than a petty war on your hands. Ah, there you are.
BANDRIL : Can you prove that you are a Time Lord?
DOCTOR: There's no time for that now. You must call off your attack. Karfel has been in the hands of a dictator. That dictator has now been overthrown. You must destroy your missile.
PERI: How close is the missile?
DOCTOR: Too close.
BANDRIL : We accept what you say, and require only sight of the Borad as proof of your goodwill.
DOCTOR: Well, that might prove a trifle difficult.
BANDRIL : Then there is little we can do.
DOCTOR: Ambassador!
PERI: Oh, terrific.
DOCTOR: Wait here.
PERI: Where are you going?
PERI: Doctor!
DOCTOR: I told you to wait with the others.
PERI: Well, I'd rather stay with you.
DOCTOR: It isn't practical.
PERI: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Practical? Advantageous, useful, productive, efficacious, effective.
PERI: Sure, desirable. What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Try and stop that missile.
PERI: Sounds dangerous.
DOCTOR: The only dangerous thing about it is having you on board to distract me. Oh!
DOCTOR: Are you still here?
PERI: Yes! Look, I'll keep out of your way.
DOCTOR: You don't know how.
PERI: I'm coming with you.
DOCTOR: Peri, every second we waste now brings Karfel into even greater danger.
PERI: Well then, let's go!
DOCTOR:: That's what I want to do, but alone. Now go back to Vena and the others, Peri. Please?
PERI: I can't. I don't trust you. You're being too reasonable.
DOCTOR: Then I shall be unreasonable. Get out! Why will you never cooperate?
PERI: Because I worry. It's my caring nature.
DOCTOR: Peri, I shall be gone for but a minute. Now, if you want to fuss over someone, may I suggest that Herbert would make a much more eager recipient.
PERI: What if something happens to you? We'd be stuck here.
DOCTOR: If I don't go now, there won't be anywhere for you to be stuck to. The planet will be destroyed. Now, will you go, please?
PERI: Well, take care of yourself.
DOCTOR: At last.
HERBERT: Hello.
DOCTOR: Hello. What are you doing here?
HERBERT: I've come to help. At least I can experience the adventure.
DOCTOR: I presume you heard what I said to Peri.
HERBERT: Oh, but she's a girl. This is work for men.
DOCTOR: Men? Men!
HERBERT: Men.
DOCTOR: Look, what I'm about to do is very dangerous. There's nothing particularly masculine about throwing your life away.
HERBERT: That's not what you said to Peri.
DOCTOR: I lied. And as I did it so badly, I'd have assumed even you would have realised.
HERBERT: I'm sorry. I simply didn't realise. I thought that
DOCTOR: You didn't think at all. That's half your problem. A characteristic you share with most of the people on your irritating planet.
HERBERT: Well, you could always take me back to Karfel if you really think it's going to be dangerous.
DOCTOR: There isn't time.
HERBERT: May I dispute that? Well, after all, what is time to a time machine?
DOCTOR: A very great deal. Should there be another day, I will explain to you in great detail which of the many time laws I am not allowed to transgress.
HERBERT: But who would know?
DOCTOR: I would. So would every other Time Lord from here to Gallifrey, and I can assure you, they're not all as pleasant and agreeable as I am.
HERBERT: Sorry. I'd hate to think of you having my demise on your conscience.
DOCTOR: To be perfectly frank, Herbert, when I go, thoughts of you will be very low on my list of regrets.
HERBERT: That's good. It means we can stand together, shoulder to shoulder, in the face of the enemy. I've always wanted to die a hero's death. You know, it's funny. When I was at school, everyone used to think I was a coward because I didn't like cricket. If only they could see me now.
DOCTOR: Shut up!
HERBERT: Sorry? Oh yes, of course, you want to concentrate. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Listen, Herbert, if you want to do something useful while waiting to enter Valhalla, could you read off the numbers on that screen you see immediately in front of you?
HERBERT: Of course. This one?
DOCTOR: How many screens do you see immediately in front of you?
HERBERT: Just the one.
DOCTOR: That's the one.
HERBERT: Two, nine, seven, three.
DOCTOR: Good.
HERBERT: Six, seven, seven.
DOCTOR: Better.
HERBERT: Eight, nine.
DOCTOR: Best!
HERBERT: Well, how will you stop the missile?
DOCTOR: I have set up the Tardis to act as a deflector shield.
HERBERT: Oh, I see. You intend us to collide with the missile before it impacts with the planet.
DOCTOR: That's right. Should make quite a big bang.
HERBERT: Oh, I see.
DOCTOR: I do wish you'd stop saying, oh, I see.
HERBERT: Sorry. I just feel a wee bit nervous. I didn't realise dying heroically was such a strain on the nerves.
DOCTOR: Oh well, shouldn't be for too long.
HERBERT: Oh, I see. Sorry. Well, I suppose if it saves millions of lives, it's worth sacrificing two. Isn't it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thirty seconds to impact.
HERBERT: I assume this is the only way.
DOCTOR: Well, if you have any other suggestions, I'd be very interested to hear them.
HERBERT: Well, couldn't we abandon ship before impact?
DOCTOR: No lifeboats.
HERBERT: That's a bit remiss. I'd have a word with the manufacturers, if. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Impact fifteen seconds.
HERBERT: Well, goodbye, Doctor. No hard feelings, I hope.
DOCTOR: No.
HERBERT: I feel a bit frightened now. Couldn't we postpone impact just for a minute?
DOCTOR: Impact five seconds.
HERBERT: No, I suppose not.
PERI: The missile's exploded in the stratosphere!
VENA: So it has.
MYKROS: It's unbelievable. They must have had a change of heart.
MYKROS: We're going to be all right.
KATZ: We've won!
BANDRIL : Let me speak with the Maylin.
MYKROS: You are speaking to the new Maylin, Ambassador. Please go ahead.
BANDRIL : The Doctor has done a brave but foolish thing. The missile has been destroyed, but so has his Tardis.
PERI: Doctor.
BANDRIL : We shall make our apologies to the High Council on Gallifrey. Furthermore, in honour of the Doctor's unselfish act, and as a token of our goodwill, may I suggest we send down a diplomatic party?
MYKROS: Yes, of course, Ambassador. I look forward to receiving you.
PERI: Oh, Doctor.
MYKROS: I'm very sorry, Peri.
PERI: Yes, I, I just want to be alone for a little while.
VENA: Of course you do.
KATZ: Are you all right?
VENA: I don't know. I don't know whether any of us will ever be the same again. It's been a terrible day.
KATZ: It's a new beginning.
VENA: Not for the Doctor or Herbert. How's Sezon?
KATZ: Feeling very sorry for himself.
VENA: Oh, Mykros! What is it?
MYKROS:  Give me your weapon. Give me your weapon!
BORAD: That will be of little use, Mykros.
MYKROS: Who are you? What are you?
BORAD: I am the Borad.
MYKROS: Never!
BORAD: I am the Borad, and you will do as I command if you value your friend's life.
MYKROS: What do you want?
BORAD: Capture the Bandril ship.
PERI: Don't listen to him.
BORAD: If you refuse, she dies.
MYKROS: One life cannot be bought at the cost of a whole planet.
BORAD: Then I shall kill her.
DOCTOR: That's not a very good idea.
MYKROS: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Besides, it's not a very nice way to treat a lady.
VENA: Doctor, we all thought you were dead.
DOCTOR: As I thought the Borad was. So why aren't you?
BORAD: I must have forgotten to mention the other experiment I have been engaged in.
DOCTOR: Ah? Not like you to pass up the opportunity to boast. What is it?
BORAD: The reproduction of living matter, cell by cell.
DOCTOR: Oh, cloning. Oh, you are a clever clogs. And how very astute of you not to risk your own rotten neck. Speaking of which, shouldn't you release your grip on Peri's? By the way, Peri, did you know he wants you for his bride?
PERI: He certainly has an original way of proposing.
DOCTOR: I'll make a deal with you, Borad. Show yourself to Peri. If she doesn't scream, the wedding can take place.
MYKROS: Doctor.
BORAD: What is this foolishness?
DOCTOR: I don't think you've got the nerve.
PERI: That's right.
BORAD: The woman will accept me once she is as I am.
DOCTOR: Make up your mind. Do you want her dead or as your bride? If the latter, then show yourself to her.
BORAD: No.
PERI: Don't I have a say in all this?
DOCTOR: Of course not. Be quiet. Why won't you?
BORAD: I shall when I am ready.
DOCTOR: As I thought. You're afraid.
BORAD: Of what?
DOCTOR: Rejection. You can alter Peri's outward appearance, but you can't change the brain in her head. Whatever you do, she will always find you repulsive.
BORAD: Then I shall put out both her eyes.
PERI: Come on, you guys.
DOCTOR: That's hardly an elegant solution, and the way you've been carrying on, you're not going to win her over with your charm.
BORAD: Stay back.
DOCTOR: You really are afraid.
BORAD: My last warning, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The possibility of perfect companionship shattered because of your grotesque, ugly, excuse for a body.
BORAD: Yet I have the power to kill you both.
DOCTOR: I don't think so.
DOCTOR: You obviously haven't read the writing on the wall. Now, this'll be an improvement.
DOCTOR: I told you she'd scream.
BORAD: Destroy it! Smash the mirror!
DOCTOR: What, no power to do it yourself?
DOCTOR: You're nothing, Borad. Just a self-degenerating mutation. You're finished, Borad. Your reign of terror's over. Nobody wants you. Nobody needs you. Nobody cares!
PERI: But haven't you sent him back to Earth?
DOCTOR: Yes, to the twelfth century.  Where exactly did we pick you up?
HERBERT: The Highlands of Scotland. Not far from Inverness.
DOCTOR: Ah. Thought I recognised the landscape. He'll be harmless enough there. At least he'll have somewhere to swim for the next thousand years.
PERI: But won't he be seen?
DOCTOR: From time to time. Right, take cover, everyone.
PERI: Okay, Doctor. Fill us in.
DOCTOR: Fill you in?
PERI: Why weren't you blown up?
DOCTOR: Ah, I'll explain one day. It's a neat trick.
PERI: Oh, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on, Herbert. Say your goodbyes. Time we got you home.
HERBERT: Well, if Vena and Mykros don't mind, I would like to stay.
VENA: He would be most welcome.
MYKROS: Indeed.
HERBERT: I say, thank you.
PERI: Are you going to let him stay?
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. I rather think he'll take my advice and return to 1885. He'll tell the world, knowing Herbert.
PERI: But who'd believe him?
DOCTOR: Not for me to say. The waves of time wash us all clean.
PERI: Doctor, you're talking in riddles again.
DOCTOR: Herbert dropped this.
PERI: Never. Oh, I don't believe it!
DOCTOR: I think he'll return to Earth, don't you? After all, he does have an interesting story to tell. Herbert. Herbert!
