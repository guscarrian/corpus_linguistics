Ghost Light
Part One
PRITCHARD: I've brought you your dinner and your copy of the Times.
MATTHEWS: Tell your Master that the Reverend Ernest Matthews has arrived. Well? This house is Gabriel Chase, is it not?
GROSE: Yes sir, but, excuse me sir, as I understood it, you would not be arriving until this evening.
MATTHEWS: Madam, my patience has already been sorely tried by the interminable journey from Oxford.
GROSE: Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. But you see, well, we don't get many visitors, you see.
MATTHEW: Apparently not. Now kindly inform Mister Smith, if he is at home, that I have answered his summons and am waiting.
GROSE: Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. This way, sir.
ACE : Professor, thirty second penalty.
DOCTOR : Just get on with it. It's all part of the initiative test.
ACE: You're still a lousy parker. Hey, play time.
DOCTOR : Well?
ACE: It's a laboratory. Oh no, could a nursery, but the kids would have to be pretty advanced. And creepy.
DOCTOR : Be concise.
ACE: It's well safe, Professor.
DOCTOR : Oh, very succinct.
ACE: It must be Earth.
DOCTOR: You tell me.
ACE: This equipment's prehistoric. I like the toys, though.
ACE: Oh, those things are pretty sick. I can't stand dead things. Must be Victorian.
DOCTOR: It's a surprise.
GROSE: It's all right, my dears. Don't worry. Our day is done. We shan't stay here a moment longer. And heaven help anyone who's still here after dark.
ACE: Nothing much in here. Alum, borax, carbon tetrachloride.
DOCTOR: Let me guess. Benzine, arsenic, boring things like that.
ACE: Yeah. Nothing volatile or explosive.
DOCTOR: No, they're all used as preservative agents in the art of taxidermy.
ACE: Urgh. Gross!
DOCTOR: Did you know Darwin suffered from seasickness?
ACE: What I need's a phone card.
DOCTOR: It's odd, that, considering his origins.
ACE: Professor, how'd you dial out on this thing?
DOCTOR: Ace! Don't touch that!
ACE: Why not? It's my initiative test.
DOCTOR: You'll give us away. These days, trespassers end up in Newgate.
ACE: The prison?
DOCTOR: Yes. It took me three weeks to try and get out the last time. Now give me that phone. Get off.
JOSIAH : Who's there?
DOCTOR: Er, sorry, wrong number.
JOSIAH: Using a telephone, Reverend Matthews? Surely you're far too fastidious a creature for such demonic apparatus.
DOCTOR: Well, now that you've so successfully drawn attention to our presence, there's only one thing for it.
ACE: Go and introduce ourselves properly.
DOCTOR: Victorians are sticklers for etiquette.
ACE: This isn't a haunted house, is it, Professor? I told you I've got this thing about haunted houses.
DOCTOR: Did you tell me that?
ACE: Yes!
DOCTOR: How many have you been in?
ACE: One was enough. Never again.
JOSIAH: I think you should go and greet our guests, my dear.
ACE: We used to go to museums on school trips. It was always don't touch, don't wander off, don't give the school a bad name. We still did it, though.
DOCTOR: The front door's this way.
ACE: Hello, what's your name? You got stuffed and it wasn't even Christmas.
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: See you later.
DOCTOR: What do you make of that?
ACE: Don't know. Whose initials are RFC?
DOCTOR: It's your initiative test.
ACE: So I'm asking the questions. When was the Royal Flying Corp invented?
DOCTOR: Ah, the name wasn't thought up until 1912. I can get you a badge if you like. Ask me another.
ACE: Who's RFC? Professor, I'm only looking.
DOCTOR: Looking's one thing.
ACE: It's radioactive.
DOCTOR: Very slightly.
ACE: Is it safe?
DOCTOR: There is no safe level.
ACE: What about RFC?
DOCTOR: Well, let's hope he abandoned it before he came to any harm.
DOCTOR: Zulu assegai. Quite lethal.
REDVERS: Where did you find it?
DOCTOR: Here. I wouldn't touch it if I were you. This is my friend Ace, and I'm the Doctor.
REDVERS: I'm a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.
DOCTOR: Really? So am I, several times over.
ACE: Is it your snuffbox?
REDVERS: Please, young lady, you're barely dressed.
ACE: Who's undressed?
DOCTOR: Excuse my young friend. She comes from a less civilised clime.
ACE: What do you want me to do, wrap up in a curtain?
DOCTOR: Be quiet, noble savage. I'm sure in Central Africa you've seen far grislier sights than Ace's ankle.
ACE: He can't see my ankle.
DOCTOR: Well, your boots, then. You're a big game hunter, I take it.
REDVERS: I am, but I've seen nothing that equals the atrocities that are rumoured about this house.
ACE: Is this the surprise, Professor? Because I'm not impressed.
REDVERS: I must say, I'm very grateful to find an ally, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are?
REDVERS: You have given me the proof I needed.
DOCTOR: The snuff box.
ACE: Don't touch it!
REDVERS: This is the first substantial evidence that I have found. I came here to find Redvers Fenn-Cooper, one of the finest explorers in the Empire.
DOCTOR: R F C.
REDVERS: I just knew he was in this house. I am commanded to find him and save him from the clutches of that blackguard, Josiah Samuel Smith.
MATTHEWS: Are you aware that I have been ringing for attention since before six o'clock? I demand to see your master immediately. This insolence has gone far enough. If I leave now, madam, Mister Smith will regret the consequences. The condemnation of the Royal Society can be ruinous. So be it.
GWENDOLINE: Reverend Matthews, you must forgive us for keeping you waiting. I am Mister Smith's ward.
MATTHEWS: You are Gwendoline, are you not?
GWENDOLINE: Yes, sir. My guardian was most concerned that you'd been kept waiting, but be assured he'll join us shortly.
REDVERS: Josiah Smith invited Redvers here. Redvers is his sternest opponent and
ACE: One of the finest explorers in the Empire.
DOCTOR: And he hasn't been seen since.
ACE: Perhaps he got lost on the way.
REDVERS: Henry Stanley found Doctor Livingstone. I shall find Redvers Fenn-Cooper.
REDVERS: Damn tsetse flies.
DOCTOR: How long did you say he'd been living in this house?
ACE: Can we go now, Professor? The whole place gives me the creeps.
DOCTOR: I thought it might.
ACE: Well, he's a head case. The house is like a morgue. Everything dead.
NIMROD: Very good, sir, I understand. I shall be with you shortly.
NIMROD: Poor silent brute.
VOICE: Not silent now.
REDVERS: Redvers had some stories. The pigmies from the Eluti forest lead him blind fold for three whole days through uncharted jungle. They took him to a swamp full of giant lizards like giant dinosaurs. Do you know, young Conan Doyle just laughed at him. Huh. Well, there's Doctor's for you.
DOCTOR: That wouldn't be a Chinese fowling piece, would it by any chance?
REDVERS: We're two weeks out of Zanzibar. I must find Redvers!
DOCTOR: Tell me what else you found.
REDVERS: Nothing!
DOCTOR: Describe it. It's all right, I'm a Doctor.
REDVERS: Yes, there was light.
DOCTOR: A bright light?
REDVERS: Burning bright in the heart of the interior. It burnt through my eyes into my mind. It had blazing, radiant wings!
ACE: Doctor!
REDVERS: Once, when Redvers was in the Congo, he faced a herd of stampeding buffalo head on. He raised his gun and with one single bullet
REDVERS: Ah, there you are, old chap. Redvers, I've found you. What have they done to you? You look like a ghost.
ACE: Is it really him?
DOCTOR: His mind's snapped. He's seen something too big to handle and snuff out. A light. I think we'd better go get some help.
ACE: That'll blow our cover. All right, all right.
PRITCHARD: Fenn-Cooper, where have you been?
DOCTOR: How do you do, I'm the Doctor and this is my friend
PRITCHARD: We've been worried about you.
REDVERS: Poor old Redvers. Poor old chap.
PRITCHARD: Come along.
DOCTOR: We don't want him hurt.
REDVERS: No, not the interior! Please, I don't want to go back to the interior!
ACE: You don't have to twist his arm like that!
NIMROD: A most unfortunate mishap, sir. I trust you and the young lady are not hurt? The gentleman has fits of distracting behaviour and must for his own safety be confined.
ACE: She didn't have to hurt him.
DOCTOR: My friend, Ace and I
NIMROD: My master, Mister Smith asks if you will join our other guest in the drawing room.
ACE:  Professor, is this an asylum with the patients in charge?
DOCTOR: Given a chance it could be Bedlam. Thank you, er?
NIMROD: Nimrod, sir.
DOCTOR: Nimrod. Thank you Nimrod. We would be delighted.
GWENDOLINE: But Uncle Josiah is a good man, and a great naturalist too. You'll see when you meet him.
MATTHEWS: Ah, so you finally condescend to meet me, sir. I am grateful for your hospitality.
DOCTOR: How do you do. How nice of you to come.
MATTHEWS: Good grief.
DOCTOR: Oh, this is my friend Ace.
MATTHEWS: I see that all the stories about you are true. You have no shred of decency, even parading your shameless wantons in front of your guests.
ACE: Does he mean me, Professor?
MATTHEWS: I have it. This is some experiment related to your mumbo-jumbo theories. Perhaps she'll evolve into a young lady.
ACE: Who are you calling young lady, Bog brain?
DOCTOR: No such luck. Quiet, Eliza. Now be a good girl. I'm making some small talk.
NIMROD: Ahem. If I might explain, sir?
DOCTOR: Ah, Nimrod, yes. There's still some tea in the pot if you'd like to go and get a couple of cups. Thank you very much.
NIMROD: The fang of a cave bear! A totem of great power.
DOCTOR: Yes. Thank you, Nimrod.
GWENDOLINE: Sir, I think Mister Matthews is confused.
DOCTOR: Never mind, I'll have him completely bewildered by the time I'm finished.
ACE: I'll help.
DOCTOR:  We've had some trouble with our carriage and Ace can't go to dinner dressed like this.
ACE: Who says?
DOCTOR: So I wonder if you have any appropriate apparel that she may borrow?
GWENDOLINE: Gladly, Professor. Come, Alice. You can borrow a dress of mine.
ACE: It's Ace, actually. Thanks anyway.
MATTHEWS: Now, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes, let me guess. My theories appall you, my heresies outrage you, I never answer letters, and you don't like my tie.
MATTHEWS: You are a worse scoundrel than Darwin.
JOSIAH: Light!
DOCTOR: Ah, Josiah Samuel Smith, I take it. Dust to dust. I'm The Doctor and this is
JOSIAH: The Reverend Ernest Matthews, Dean of Merton College, Oxford. Your servant says welcome to Gabriel Chase.
MATTHEWS: Josiah Smith. Now perhaps you'll account for your theories.
DOCTOR: Fascinating moths.
JOSIAH: I recently made a study of these moths. Even in a single species there can be a wide variation of colouring from countryside to town. I'm certain they're adapting to survive the smoke with which industry's tainting the land.
MATTHEWS: Darwinian claptrap.
JOSIAH: Nonsense, you say? I had hoped to find you more adaptable.
DOCTOR: Yes, adapt or become extinct, Ernest.
MATTHEWS: No one asked for your opinion, sir.
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, I suggest you concede to my wisdom and button it.
MATTHEWS: I beg your pardon?
DOCTOR: Why don't you just read Darwin instead of condemning him.
GWENDOLINE: Mrs. Pritchard, what's happening?
PRITCHARD: The door is jammed.
ACE: Here, let me have a try.
ACE: Okay, stand back.
DOCTOR: That's no way for a Victorian lady, gentlemen to behave.
ACE: I'm no gentleman.
JOSIAH: Well, Gwen, this a metamorphosis.
GWENDOLINE: It was Ace's idea. 
JOSIAH: Nimrod, the door.
DOCTOR: Stay back.
DOCTOR:  Cover your eyes!
NIMROD: I'm sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Redvers, what did you see?
REDVERS: Poor old Redvers. He was so frightened his hair turned completely white. He went quite mad, you know.
NIMROD: We must leave, Doctor!
DOCTOR: But he may need help.
ACE: What's happening, Professor?
PRITCHARD: This way, please.
ACE: Ow!
DOCTOR: I wanted to see him.
PRITCHARD: Out of the question.
JOSIAH: He will be well taken care of.
ACE: I bet.  What was that light? He was so scared of it.
NIMROD: Doctor, I can personally assure you that Mister Fenn-Cooper is being made comfortable and will come to no harm.
DOCTOR: Only the madmen may see the path clearly through the tangled forest.
NIMROD: You have the wisdom of the greatest elders of my tribe, Doctor.
JOSIAH: Nimrod, you have duties to perform.
NIMROD: Sir.
ACE: He's a Neanderthal, isn't he?
DOCTOR: Yes. The finest example I've seen this side of the Stone Age.
VOICE : Did that hurt? Good. Now open door.
ACE: I still haven't worked out where this place is.
MATTHEWS: And I am still waiting for an explanation for your blasphemous theories.
ACE: What theories?
DOCTOR: Darwin's theories. They turned nineteenth century science on it's head.
ACE: Is there a free lecture thrown in with dinner?
DOCTOR: Yes, that was always his specialty.
ACE: Do we take notes?
MATTHEWS: Mister Smith disputes man's rightful dominion over the forces of nature.
JOSIAH: I hope you have a taste for calves' brains, Doctor.
MATTHEWS: Instead he maintains that mankind itself should adapt to serve nature or become extinct.
JOSIAH: Well, sir.
JOSIAH: Oh, pray excuse me, sir.
MATTHEWS: Infernal telephonic machines.
ACE: Let's ring out for a takeaway. Anyone fancy a curry?
DOCTOR: I know a nice little restaurant in the Khyber Pass.
JOSIAH: Nimrod! What's going on? I told you not to ring me now. Nimrod, are you there?
VOICE : I escaped.
JOSIAH: It's learned to speak.
DOCTOR: Having trouble with your connections? Perhaps I can help.
ACE : Doctor!
DOCTOR: On the other hand, I have an emergency of my own. Excuse me. Time to emerge.
JOSIAH: Mrs Pritchard, a problem has arisen. Ask Ernest Matthews to join me in here.
PRITCHARD: Very good, sir.
JOSIAH: Then no one is to disturb us.
ACE : Doctor!
ACE: Doctor, where are you? I want to talk to you!
DOCTOR: Ace! What's the matter?
ACE: Face-ache Matthews in there says this house is Gabriel Chase.
DOCTOR: So?
ACE: It was all falling down last time I saw it in 1983. You tricked me! This is Perivale!
DOCTOR: Ace!
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: It's true, isn't it. This is the house I told you about.
DOCTOR: You were thirteen. You climbed over the wall for a dare.
ACE: That's your surprise, isn't it, bringing me back here.
DOCTOR: Remind me what it was that you sensed when you entered this deserted house. An aura of intense evil?
ACE: Don't you have things you hate?
DOCTOR: I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places, full of lost luggage and lost souls.
ACE: I told you I never wanted to come back here again.
DOCTOR: Then there's unrequited love, and tyranny, and cruelty.
ACE: Too right.
DOCTOR: We all have a universe of our own terrors to face.
ACE: I face mine on my own terms.
DOCTOR: But don't you want to know what happened here?
ACE: No!
DOCTOR: You've learned something you didn't recognise when you were thirteen.
ACE: Like what?
DOCTOR: The nature of the horror that you sensed here.
ACE: It's alien.
JOSIAH: Ernest, pray sit down. I'm afraid that something unforeseen awaits my attention. I shall have to ask you to indulge me a little further.
GWENDOLINE : I don't know what it is about my
MATTHEWS: Having come so far, sir, I have no intention of leaving until I've gained full satisfaction
JOSIAH: Then we're in accord. Mrs Pritchard, see to it that the Dean's time passes as quickly as possible.
PRITCHARD: Very good sir.
GWENDOLINE:  That's the way to the zoo, that's the way to the zoo. The monkey house is nearly full but there's room enough for you. Take a bus to Regent's Park, make haste before it shuts. Next Monday I will come and bring you such a lot of nuts.
GWENDOLINE : That's the way to the zoo.
DOCTOR: Come back to dinner, Ace.
ACE: When I lived in Perivale, me and my best mate, we dossed around together. We'd out-dare each other on things. Skiving off, stupid things. Then they burnt out Manisha's flat. White kids firebombed it. I didn't care anymore.
DOCTOR: I think you cared a lot, Ace.
ACE: That's when I came over the walls of the house. This house. I was so mad, and I needed to get away. It was empty, all overgrown and falling down. No one came here. But when I got inside it was even worse. I didn't know then. It was horrible!
DOCTOR: Tell me what you saw.
JOSIAH: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tell me, Ace.
ACE: Excuse me!
JOSIAH: I must speak with you.
JOSIAH: I need your help, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. It can't be easy being so far away from home, struggling to adapt to an alien environment.
JOSIAH: My roots are in this house. I'm as human as you are.
DOCTOR: Yes.
JOSIAH: I'm afflicted with an enemy, a vile and base creature pitted against me. It's waiting for me now. I believe that you can assist me in defeating it.
DOCTOR: I'm not interested in money. How much?
JOSIAH: Five thousand pounds to rid me of the evil brute.
DOCTOR:  Now that's what I call Victorian value. But I'm still not interested in money.
VOICE : There's a new scent in the dark. There's a warming, pulsing, racing blood! Smells like ratkin.
VOICE : Wake up. Move yourselves. Come on. Ratkin's come to visit. Come on, move, move. Run, ratkin, run. Better get away.
VOICE : Fetch!
ACE: You don't frighten me! Doctor! 
VOICE : Ratkin! Ratkin!
VOICE : Ratkin!
Part Two
DOCTOR: Beetles and bluebottles.
GWENDOLINE: It's one of my favourites in the whole collection. It's from Java.
DOCTOR: Java?
GWENDOLINE: The Reverend Ernest Matthews will be leaving for Java soon. Perhaps he'll see my father.
DOCTOR: Your father, is he there?
GWENDOLINE: Uncle Josiah sent him there after he saw what was in the cellar.
DOCTOR: Gwendoline, do you know where Ace is?
VOICE : Revenge is nearer. Revenge, ratkin.
NIMROD: Get back! Back! Are you all right, miss?
ACE: They don't like the flame, do they.
VOICE : Door must open.
NIMROD: We must leave the chamber now.
VOICE : Open door! Quickly, quickly!
ACE: It's getting out! Give me that!
NIMROD: Stay calm! Follow me to the tunnel. While we have the lamp, we're safe.
VOICE : No more lamp.
VOICE : Stop ratkin.
ACE: I'll sort you lot out.
DOCTOR: Josiah, where's Ace?
JOSIAH: How should I know? Have you considered my offer, Doctor?
DOCTOR: What, to murder your enemy? I'm not your pet executioner. Ace is in trouble.
JOSIAH: Be careful, Doctor. To cross me could be a serious error.
PRITCHARD: Miss Ace has already retired to bed, sir. Come, I will show you.
GWENDOLINE: Here, Doctor, to light you to bed.
GWENDOLINE: Sleep well. Goodnight.
DOCTOR: Good night, sleep tight. Up the wooden hill to Bedfordshire, otherwise known as Java. Well, not tonight, Josiah-phine!
DOCTOR: Your puppet show doesn't fool me. Sorry to spoil your big game hunt, but Ace need my
DOCTOR: Help.
ACE: Let us go or I'll smash it!
NIMROD: Give it to me! You are profaning the temple of light.
ACE: I'll profane you in a minute. And shut that thing up.
NIMROD: You are afraid and do not understand.
NIMROD: The sleeping one must not be woken!
JOSIAH: The fool! What's it done?
DOCTOR: Right, Josiah. Let's get down the rabbit hole. Get that lift!
DOCTOR: Open those doors! Quickly!
ACE: Steam power! Oi, Tarzan. Nimrod! What's happened? Nimrod!
JOSIAH: Light.
DOCTOR: At the end of the tunnel. Get a move on. Ace?
ACE: Doctor, where have you been?
DOCTOR: Where haven't I been. I came as quick as I could.
JOSIAH: What have you done to my observatory?
ACE: Get off! It's what it nearly did to me.
DOCTOR: Ace, you haven't been tampering?
ACE: It was an accident.
JOSIAH: All my work could be ruined.
DOCTOR: That's my girl.
ACE: Oh, come on, Professor. Let's get out of this madhouse.
DOCTOR: No, keep him covered.
ACE: But
DOCTOR: Shush.
ACE: Move it, you.
GWENDOLINE: Why did Father go to Java and leave me? And where is Mama? I try and try, but I can't understand.
PRITCHARD: That is a wicked thing to say. Wicked. Your mother would be ashamed if she could hear you. Sitting there dressed like a music hall trollop. It's this Doctor, filling your head with his ideas.
GWENDOLINE: His words are so confusing. Uncle Josiah's ideas are much clearer.
PRITCHARD: Go upstairs and dress yourself decently.
ACE: Don't try anything.
DOCTOR: Oh, not a patch on the Flying Scotsman.
JOSIAH: Nimrod! Get up, you fool. It's got to be stopped.
DOCTOR: Better not to move him.
ACE: He fell against that thing.
DOCTOR: He disturbed whatever's hibernating inside.
JOSIAH: Don't touch it!
ACE: You're scared of it too, just like the others.
DOCTOR: Because you know what's in there, don't you, Josiah?
JOSIAH: There's an energy escape. I must stop it.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I always leave these things to the last moment. These husks. Old cast-offs of yours, I take it?
ACE: They attacked Nimrod and me.
JOSIAH: You're insane! If the membrane is broken
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: Oh, what?
DOCTOR: Genetic codes.
ACE: DNA.
DOCTOR: You've done a lot of exploring in here, haven't you, Josiah?
ACE: This is a stone spaceship.
DOCTOR: Yes, and the real owner won't be pleased when it wakes up.
JOSIAH: I am the real owner.
DOCTOR: Oh no, you're not. You're just part of the cargo.
JOSIAH: You're so smug and self-satisfied, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I try.
ACE: Drop it.
JOSIAH: I'm not a simpleton. That device is a radiation detector, not a gun.
JOSIAH: You're going to help me stabilise the energy loss, or most of southern England goes up in a firestorm.
VOICE : Set me free.
REDVERS: Not much time left. Soon be light.
GWENDOLINE: Mister Fenn-Cooper.
REDVERS: So, you've seen Redvers, too. Where are they holding the poor devil? I know he's close by.
GWENDOLINE: I'm lost. I'm so lost and alone.
REDVERS: Redvers got used to loneliness in the bush. He understands.
GWENDOLINE: I cannot find my mother. I'm sure she was here.
REDVERS: Don't be alarmed. Redvers Fenn-Cooper always escapes in the end. He knows where the greatest secret of all is hidden. It sleeps in the depths of the interior, and it must never be woken. 
JOSIAH: Drive in the crystal rods when I instruct you.
ACE: After this I'll get a job at Sellafield. It'll be safer.
DOCTOR:  Just do what I do when I do it.
ACE: Hmm, very helpful.
JOSIAH: Lower the first rod.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, oh dear. Skeletons in the cupboard. Husks in the cellar.
ACE: Bats in the belfry.
JOSIAH: Do it!
DOCTOR: Now, now, don't shout. You'll never evolve into a nice Victorian gentleman if you shout.
ACE: Did those husks really used to be him?
DOCTOR: Yes. Not much improvement on the reptile, is he?
JOSIAH: Just do it! Now!
DOCTOR: Well, I think congratulations are in order.
ACE: Congratulations? Maybe not. Professor, the husks!
VOICE : Give me freeness. I want freeness!
DOCTOR: Quick, get up! Move! Move!
VOICE : Control needs freeness now!
ACE: Quick, Doctor!
VOICE : Help me be like you.
ACE: Look out!
CONTROL : Give me my freeness!
DOCTOR: Ah, how do you do. I'm the Doctor and this is my friend Ace.
ACE: Just call me ratkin.
CONTROL : Ah, poor Control. No way out. No escaping. No hoping.
JOSIAH: Don't listen to it. It's a depraved monstrosity.
DOCTOR: Depraved or deprived? There, there, Control. There, there. Now, which of you is the Jekyll and which is the Hyde?
CONTROL : Spare a farthing, Guv'nor. Pity poor Control, locked away all alone.
JOSIAH: Fie!
PRITCHARD: They're coming. It's almost first light.
ACE: He's getting weaker.
DOCTOR: It's been a hard day's night. He's evolving again, to his next stage.
JOSIAH: I've sealed the lower observatory. Let Control rot down there.
PRITCHARD: You are ill, sir.
JOSIAH: It's getting light. Secure the house. I must change.
PRITCHARD: Take him to the upper observatory.
GWENDOLINE: Uncle!
DOCTOR: We won't see them till nightfall.
ACE: Shouldn't we follow them? What about Josiah?
DOCTOR: He sounded a little husky.
ACE: Oh, you mean he's changing into one of those things?
DOCTOR: Yes.
MATTHEWS: So, here you are at last. Haven't I been kept waiting long enough?
JOSIAH: Reverend Matthews.
MATTHEWS: I perceive you are a sick man, sir. Divine retribution for your blasphemy, perhaps?
JOSIAH: It will pass.
MATTHEWS: And so will your unholy theories of evolution. It's a complete absurdity that the line of my ancestors could be traced back to a protoplasmic globule.
JOSIAH: Please, go on.
MATTHEWS: Man has been the same, sir, since he stood in the garden of Eden, and he was never ever a chattering gibbering ape.
MATTHEWS: What are you laughing at? Devil take you, why are you laughing?
GWENDOLINE: Can Nimrod be woken now?
DOCTOR: Oh, don't rush me, Gwendoline. The sun has got its hat on, and we've got all day before Uncle Josiah dare show his face.
ACE: Professor. Josiah's lucifigus.
DOCTOR: Yes. He doesn't like light, either.
ACE: What about the spaceship in the cellar? It's knackered, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes. I fixed it. Uncle Josiah knows as much about it's secrets as a hamburger knows about the Amazon desert.
ACE: Sounds a bit like you and the Tardis.
GWENDOLINE: Light!
DOCTOR: Let her go. Come on, Ace. We've only just started. Now, there's one thing you haven't told me. What was it that frightened you so much when you entered this house in a hundred years time?
JOSIAH: Reverend Matthews, I thought you would amuse me, but you bore me just as much as you did before. 
JOSIAH: Gwendoline. Come here, dear child.
GWENDOLINE: Are you unwell, Uncle?
JOSIAH: Only sick at heart, my dear. Soon I shall restore the blighted British Empire to its full power and vigour.
MATTHEWS: You're no better than animals. 
JOSIAH: The Reverend makes such a tedious toy, don't you think?
GWENDOLINE: Dear Uncle.
JOSIAH: We're so glad he has to go.
GWENDOLINE: And where is he going?
JOSIAH: To Java!
DOCTOR: Time to call out the constabulary. Now, Inspector, perhaps you can assist us with our enquiries.
ACE: Hello?
GROSE: The Doctor said that you'd be fair famished when you woke up, so here's scrambled egg, hot buttered toast, kedgeree, kidney, sausage and bacon.
ACE: Cholesterol city.
GROSE: Oh, no dear. Perivale village. Properly exhausted you were when I put you to bed. Oh yes, and there's a message. Would you join the Doctor and the police gentleman in the drawing room.
ACE: Police?
GROSE: It's high time they were called. I've said as much to my husband, Mister Grose.
ACE: I think I'll give that a miss, actually. I want to have a walk round Perivale village before lunch. Is there a blacksmith on the village green?
GROSE: Mercy me, no, dearie. There's only seven houses. Besides, you've missed lunch. Why, it must be all of five o'clock by now.
ACE: What!
GROSE: Yes, almost evening. Now, we must hurry. No one in their right mind stays in this house after dark.
DOCTOR: Snap out of it, Nimrod. If I didn't know better I'd say this was deliberate. Ten minutes was all it took to wake up the more sophisticated, civilised, police inspector.
MACKENZIE: Ah, you say this house is owned by Josiah Samuel Smith.
DOCTOR: I didn't say owned, I said inhabited.
MACKENZIE: Then where is he? This whole house is deserted.
DOCTOR: He will appear.
MACKENZIE: I suppose this must be the manservant. Nasty looking customer. Must be a foreigner.
DOCTOR: Neanderthal.
MACKENZIE: Ah, gypsy blood. I can see it in him. Lazy workers. What's this one playing up over? Oh, beg your pardon.
DOCTOR: He's mesmerised.
MACKENZIE: No self-control, these Mediterraneans. Too excitable. Nasty tempers, too.
DOCTOR: Yes, especially when roused. Which is exactly what is eluding me at the moment.
GROSE: Have you finished, dear? Oh, is anything wrong?
ACE: Where's my clobber? My gear? My clothes.
GROSE: Those shabby old things? Why, the Doctor had me lay out this for you. Well, will it do, my dear?
ACE: No bustle. Okay, Professor, you win.
GROSE: Much more fitting for a young lady.
CONTROL: Control be free to change.
DOCTOR: I'm busy, Inspector.
MACKENZIE: And I have my investigation to complete.
DOCTOR: Still not found the mustard? Since I awoke you, you have consumed three English breakfasts, two elevenses and one four-course meal. Why don't you go and get Mrs Grose to make you some afternoon tea.
MACKENZIE: She's hiding facts from me, and so are you, and if you don't tell me where the rest of the household is, I shall arrest you for obstructing my enquires.
ACE: Professor, you could have woken me sooner.
DOCTOR: This is Inspector MacKenzie from Scotland Yard. He was sent here in 1881 to investigate the disappearance of the owner, Sir George Pritchard.
ACE: But that was two years ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, he's been in Josiah's cupboard ever since. Preserved, hypnotised. Humour him.
ACE: Preserved?
DOCTOR: Inspector? This is my friend, Ace.
ACE: Hello. All right?
DOCTOR: I like the dress.
MACKENZIE: Perhaps you can tell me where Lady Pritchard is, Miss?
ACE: Oh, you mean the old bag, the housekeeper?
MACKENZIE: I gather you live in Perivale village.
ACE: I'll be moving to the area, sometime. How's Tarzan?
DOCTOR: Still no change. Still out like a light. Light!
DOCTOR : The fang of the cave bear calls you, Nimrod. Tell me your tale.
NIMROD: At the season when the ice floods swamp the pasture lands, we herded the mammoths sunwards to find new grazing.
MACKENZIE: Tricky things, mammoths.
NIMROD: Wise men cast bones to make hunting magic and spoke with the voice of the Burning One.
ACE: Is this a race memory?
DOCTOR: No, these are his own experiences.
NIMROD: Now the wild world is lost in a desert of smoke and straight lines. There is smoke thickening.
NIMROD: But light will return.
CONTROL: Light will return.
MACKENZIE: This madhouse needs one more good going over.
DOCTOR: Good idea. But try and be back by six.
ACE: Professor, look.
DOCTOR: Yes.
MACKENZIE: Why?
DOCTOR: Around here, the forces of darkness don't wait until midnight to appear.
ACE: Professor.
DOCTOR: I know.
ACE: I thought the lift was broken.
DOCTOR: I mended it. It's very clever, climbing up the lift shaft, but I had hoped that Control creature might bring something with it, and for that it will need the lift.
ACE: Professor, what's going on?
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Quiet. Josiah Samuel Smith and Control are frightened of it. Redvers Fenn-Cooper saw it and lost his mind. Nimrod, he worships it.
ACE: Let there be light?
DOCTOR: It's asleep down there in its spaceship and Josiah doesn't want it awoken.
ACE: Well, maybe that's a good idea. Maybe it should be left alone. Professor, just this once.
DOCTOR: It's very, very old. Perhaps even older. Just one chat.
ACE: Professor. Where's Nimrod?
DOCTOR: Gone to see a man about a god.
ACE: Urgh! They're alive.
DOCTOR: Yes. Things are hotting quicker than I anticipated. Quick, run and get Inspector MacKenzie.
REDVERS: Redvers knew the relief column would arrive.
NIMROD: Excuse me, sir, but you speak with the wildness of the old world. Is it appropriate to seek your wisdom?
REDVERS: You won't get far without good supplies. Baggage animals, porters.
NIMROD: The one I serve, sir, the Burning One, he's waking. What should I do?
REDVERS: Stanley found Livingstone. I found Redvers, once. You must hunt the dark continent. Seek out what you desire. But be warned, you may find it.
NIMROD: I must free you from your bonds, sir.
REDVERS: The Doctor did that hours ago. Redvers only wears it against the cold of the night air.
CONTROL: Move! Time going faster than you. Move. Light angry, burning angry, but not at poor Control. Control going showing Light way up. Then Control on way up too!
ACE: Inspector? Found anything?
MACKENZIE: Nothing. This place has more locked doors than Reading Gaol.
DOCTOR: All civilisation starts with hunting and foraging, but don't worry, you'll work your way up. You must excuse me. Things are getting out of control.
MACKENZIE: No one up here, either.
ACE: Josiah.
MACKENZIE: Disgusting object. What is it?
ACE: It's what's left of Josiah Smith. It's just a husk. I think we should get out of here.
MACKENZIE: Nonsense, young lady. That thing isn't dangerous.
MACKENZIE: Lady Pritchard!
ACE: Lady?
MACKENZIE: Sir George's wife.
ACE: Gwendoline. She's their daughter, isn't she.
MACKENZIE: What's happening in this house?
ACE: They're just toys. They're just Josiah's toys.
ACE: Homo Victorianus Ineptus. Oh no, I don't want to see.
ACE: Reverend Matthews. I think I'm going to throw up.
DOCTOR: Nimrod, where's Ace?
NIMROD: I have not seen her, Doctor. I must seek the truth from the Burning One.
DOCTOR: Stick around. I'll save you a trip.
NIMROD: Can you summon it, then?
DOCTOR: Let's just say I've made a deal with its agent.
DOCTOR: That'll be them now. Where's Ace got to? It's not dark yet, but I don't want Josiah to miss the show.
ACE: Let's get out of here, quickly.
MACKENZIE: Let go of her! I am a police officer. You will do as I tell you.
MACKENZIE: Let go of me!
ACE: It's Josiah!
ACE: Stitch this, Dracula.
JOSIAH: I no longer need to crouch in shadows, young lady.
ACE: You're no gentleman. Scratch the Victorian veneer and something nasty'll come crawling out.
JOSIAH: Your meddling Doctor thought to get the better of me, but I'll see him squirming yet. Bring her!
MACKENZIE: Let go of me! I am a police officer. You will do as I say.
DOCTOR: That's quite enough of that.
NIMROD: Doctor, you are as powerful as you are wise.
DOCTOR: Cut the homespun twaddle, Nimrod. It's not wise. I've lit the blue touch-paper and found there's nowhere to retire to. Ladies, I do hope you enjoy indoor fireworks.
NIMROD: The Burning One is coming.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I'd stand back from that lift, Nimrod, if I were you. To catch a wolf, I may have unleashed a tiger.
JOSIAH: Doctor, what are you doing? Stop the lift!
DOCTOR: Ah, Josiah. So you've finally evolved into a Victorian. How quaint. And Ace, you've made it in time.
ACE: Sorry, Professor.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't apologise. Come and meet Josiah's new guest.
JOSIAH: Nimrod, stop the lift! Stop it!
DOCTOR: Much too late for that. It's now time to shed a little light on your plans.
PRITCHARD: Hold him.
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Ace.
JOSIAH: You've made a pact with that creature. You don't know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: No, but I'm about to find out. You can come out now! We're all waiting!
JOSIAH: Control, quintessence of wickedness, corruption incarnate.
DOCTOR: Thank you for trusting me, Control.
CONTROL: My half agreeing done. You desiring, in the darkness you shall find it.
JOSIAH: Don't let it out!
Part Three
JOSIAH: Light!
DOCTOR: Josiah, come back! Er, how do you do? I'm the Doctor. This is my friend Ace, and I hope you slept well.
MACKENZIE: What the devil is that thing?
ACE: It's an angel, stupid.
DOCTOR: That's just it's shape here on Earth. It's called Light, and it's come to survey life here.
ACE: It was crashed out in the stone spaceship in the basement.
DOCTOR: And while it slept, the survey got out of control.
CONTROL: Control is me.
DOCTOR: And the survey is Josiah.
ACE: And now Light's come to sort out the muddle.
DOCTOR: That was my idea.
MACKENZIE: And who are you?
DOCTOR: I wouldn't want to confuse you.
CONTROL: Remember our agreement, Doctor. You promised Control freeness.
LIGHT: Control?
CONTROL: Now! Tell it now!
LIGHT: How long have I been asleep, and why have I naturalised in this form?
DOCTOR: No, Light. Don't!
DOCTOR: That was unnecessary.
LIGHT: Wasteful. None of the weapons work.
DOCTOR: Josiah, withdraw with your people.
JOSIAH: Withdraw!
DOCTOR: We'll talk.
LIGHT: Nothing leaves until I have explanations.
DOCTOR: How many more times, Light? This is Earth. I mean, why don't you check the instruments in your spaceship? Where has he got to now?
ACE: How does Light move so fast?
DOCTOR: He travels at the speed of thought.
LIGHT: Earth. Why mention that wretched planet to me?
ACE: If you don't like it, then bog off.
LIGHT: I once spent centuries faithfully cataloguing all the species there, every organism from the smallest bacteria to the largest ichthyosaur. But no sooner had I finished than it all started changing. New species, new sub-species, evolution running amok. I had to start amending my entries. Oh, the task is endless.
DOCTOR: That's life.
LIGHT:  Control.
LIGHT: How many more millennia must I suffer your company? Is this Earth? Well?
CONTROL: Control wants her freeness. Be a lady-like. Doctor promised.
LIGHT: It is not his to give.
ACE: Did you promise, Professor?
DOCTOR: Things ran away with themselves.
CONTROL: Control too run away.
DOCTOR: Light, Light, give her a break. She's not your real troublemaker.
LIGHT: You are interfering.
DOCTOR: Yes, just like you, only I didn't get caught napping. Why don't you forget the survey, Light, and go!
ACE: Has he gone?
DOCTOR: No.
JOSIAH: Nothing will delay my plans for the Empire. With luck, Light and the Doctor will be at each other's throats before they even notice. Mrs Pritchard will organise dinner.
PRITCHARD: Very good, sir.
JOSIAH: Gwendoline, it's time for Miss Ace to leave us.
GWENDOLINE: I'm sure she'll enjoy Java, Uncle, once she gets there.
JOSIAH: Not as much as you'll enjoy sending her, my dear.
JOSIAH: And Redvers Fenn-Cooper?
REDVERS: Redvers kicked over his traces and lost himself in the bush. Lord knows if he'll ever find his way out again.
JOSIAH: And your other quest, Redvers?
REDVERS: I can't recall. The heat haze is dazzling.
JOSIAH: I need you, Redvers. Stay out of trouble. We have a royal appointment to keep.
CONTROL: Control's new world.
REDVERS: You like them? You take. Now we trade words.
LIGHT: No. This is not Earth. It cannot be.
LIGHT: Come here, child. I need your assistance.
ACE: What was that?
DOCTOR: Just our imaginations.
ACE: No sign of Control. It's weird. It feels like this whole place is coming alive.
DOCTOR: Yes. It's the energy from Light's ship. Invigorating, isn't it?
ACE: No.
DOCTOR: What does it remind you of? All right, all right, all right. What happened here in a hundred years time is none of my business.
ACE: I thought this was a haunted house.
DOCTOR: It is.
ACE: I was only thirteen.
DOCTOR: Of course.
ACE: I got frightened, that's all.
DOCTOR: The Tardis key. You can always wait for me there.
ACE: That's the easy way out.
DOCTOR: Well, come on, then.
ACE: Doctor, have you ever had one of those nightmares where you couldn't move? Doctor?
ACE: You're all dead! You're all dead! It wasn't my fault! I'm not guilty! I couldn't help it!
GWENDOLINE: Ace, my dear, I want you to come away. Come away with me to Java.
MACKENZIE: Ah, Lady Pritchard. I've been wanting a word with you. Perhaps we can sort this business out over a pot of tea.
PRITCHARD: Dispose of that specimen immediately.
ACE: You're a right little vicious Victorian, aren't you.
REDVERS: The handsomest woman Redvers ever saw was daughter to an N'Taba chief, but she had a bone through her nose and ate her cousin for breakfast.
CONTROL: Will Control be ladylike? Want so much.
REDVERS: Once this hunt is over, I'll make you the finest ladylike in the Empire.
DOCTOR: Having fun, Control?
CONTROL: You! You come taking away Control's freeness.
DOCTOR: Control, I've come to help you and to ask you for your help.
CONTROL: No help. It's mine. You won't take it.
DOCTOR: No, Control, don't!
DOCTOR: Come back! Bah. You won't get far!
REDVERS: Of course, if she was a real lady, I wouldn't be in her boudoir.
DOCTOR: Oh, things are getting out of control. Even I can't play this many games at once.
REDVERS: Then help me. Help me with my hunt.
DOCTOR: I haven't got time, Redvers.
REDVERS: But I'm hunting the rarest creature in the world. The crowned Saxe-Coburg. Look.
DOCTOR: Really? And who's sponsoring the expedition, Josiah Samuel Smith?
REDVERS: When I find it, I shall shoot it.
GWENDOLINE: Come on, Ace. I don't want to hurt you. It'll, it'll be painless.
REDVERS: The crowned Saxe-Coburg isn't easy to discover.
DOCTOR: A good hunter always knows the signs, like a royal invitation to Buckingham Palace, perhaps. Why else do you think Josiah has kept you alive so long, Redvers?
REDVERS: Will you join my expedition, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not yet. I've got to find Ace.
GWENDOLINE: Come here, you little brat.
ACE: Get off me, you! Control, help me!
LIGHT: I wanted to see how it works, so I dismantled it. I need another specimen.
NIMROD: Sir, you are Light. Long ago, my people worshipped you as the Burning One.
LIGHT: I know you. I took you up as the last specimen of the extinct Neanderthal race from Earth.
NIMROD: Yes, sir.
LIGHT: At least they knew when to stop evolving. Who released you from your quarantine cubicle?
NIMROD: Mister Josiah, sir. I am in his service.
LIGHT: Look at these microbes. They're evolving even as I speak. My entire catalogue of the planet is worthless. Centuries of work wasted.
MACKENZIE: Ah. Perhaps one of you can tell me where I can find the Doctor. This place is like a madhouse.
LIGHT: We don't want things to change. We make sure that they cannot.
ACE: Control?
CONTROL: Leave alone. Go away.
ACE: Am I still ratkin? It's all right. I didn't mean it.
CONTROL: Hate world. Hate freeness. It bites. Ran away into big empty nothing. Sky flew away to nothing. Want to hide from big open emptiness world.
ACE: It's this house. When you're a kid you smash things you hate, but what do I do if it keeps coming back?
CONTROL: World only changing for him. Now he's Josiah. Big man now, leaving Control behind. Control no ladylike.
ACE: Oh, cut the whinging, Control. You want to fight back. You've got to beat Josiah at his own game.
ACE: Go on, try again. The rain in Spain falls mainly down the drain.
CONTROL: The rain-ah, in Spain-ah, falls mainly
GWENDOLINE: There you are, Ace, my dear.
ACE: Control, help me!
CONTROL: New game play. Control go next.
REDVERS: The natives restless tonight.
GWENDOLINE: Let me go! Let me go!
DOCTOR: Gwendoline, who does this remind you of?
DOCTOR: Severe trauma. I could forgive her arranging those little trips to Java
REDVERS: She was hypnotised, Doctor.
DOCTOR: If she didn't enjoy them so much.
ACE: Professor, Control's got a few things to show Josiah.
CONTROL: No longer hiding.
DOCTOR: Good. Just in time for dinner.
DOCTOR: Good evening, Josiah.  Don't have the soup.
JOSIAH: Get that creature out of here. Get it out.
ACE: Go on, Control. Knock 'em dead.
CONTROL: Control has her freeness now, squire.
JOSIAH: What's this? Where's Gwendoline?
CONTROL: Better orf without you, guv'nor.
JOSIAH: You win this move, Doctor, but I will not suffer that creature at my table.
REDVERS: That, sir, is no way to speak in front of a ladylike.
ACE: Oi, Jungle Jim, I'm here too, you know.
CONTROL: No one hurting Control. Not in gutter now.
DOCTOR: Who was it said Earthmen never invite their ancestors round to dinner?
DOCTOR: Oh, which reminds me. Lady Pritchard, have you seen this?
DOCTOR: It belongs to your daughter Gwendoline. And there's a portrait of you in there, you see? Very nice likeness. You and Sir George must have been very happy before the cuckoo invaded your nest.
PRITCHARD: Gwendoline. Oh, oh, Gwendoline.
JOSIAH: Mrs Pritchard, you're not dismissed.
REDVERS: Let her alone, sir. The lioness always protects her cubs.
DOCTOR: No soup, Ace.
JOSIAH: There's no way out of his for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I knew it was a trap as soon as I walked in to it. Unfortunately, your guest of honour seems to have let you down.
JOSIAH: Light will come.
LIGHT: It's still changing, seething. Every plain and crevice crawls with life, but I recognise the stench of its over-ripe infested carcase.
PRITCHARD: Gwendoline?
GWENDOLINE: Mama?
PRITCHARD: Oh, Gwendoline.
GWENDOLINE: Mama!
PRITCHARD: Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear. Oh, we were so happy once. Do you remember riding down to the village with your father, the dogs running behind, barking? And then he went away, to Java. You sent him.
GWENDOLINE: Mama, I thought you were lost.
PRITCHARD: Oh, I am, my dear. We both are.
GWENDOLINE: Oh, Mama, what have we done?
LIGHT: You changed. Like the rest of this verminous planet, you adapted to your situation to survive.
LIGHT: Well, you'll never change again.
NIMROD: They never harmed you.
LIGHT: I've decided Earth's future. We must collect items from the ship. Follow me.
DOCTOR: Josiah, tell me about your plan to assassinate Queen Victoria.
ACE: You what?
JOSIAH: Who have you been talking to?
DOCTOR: Myself, mostly. But you're not really empire material, are you? I mean, your background's a bit dodgy. And light wouldn't be amused.
ACE: Neither will Queen Vic.
JOSIAH: The British Empire's an anarchic mess. There's no clear directive from the throne, mo discipline. Result? Confusion, wastage. I can provide a new order. Wealth, prosperity.
DOCTOR: Confusion, wastage, tyranny, burnt toast, till all the atlas is pink.
DOCTOR: But it isn't your invitation to Buckingham Palace. Redvers?
REDVERS: I am allowed to take a guest.
CONTROL: Control proper ladylike now. Out to dinner. Take Control meeting Queen lady.
JOSIAH: Redvers, we agreed. We hunt the crowned Saxe-Coburg together.
REDVERS: I gave up on Redvers long ago. All he ever talks about is himself. Here, Control.
CONTROL: It's mine, or I burn it.
JOSIAH: You basest creatures. You dare to defy me? I'm a man of property!
CONTROL: Then I burn whole house up.
JOSIAH: No!
 
ACE: No, Control, don't do it! Please don't do it! That's what I did!
DOCTOR: In 1983? Ace, you didn't tell me that.
ACE: You're not my probation officer. You don't have to know everything.
DOCTOR: Ace.
ACE: It was the house. It was full of evil and hate left by him. So I burnt the house down. I had to.
CONTROL: It is wickedness.
JOSIAH: No!
DOCTOR: He only wanted to take over an Empire. At least he didn't want to destroy the world.
DOCTOR: Light, I think I've solved your problem for you.
LIGHT: There's only one solution to Earth. I was going to reduce it to this.
ACE: Oh, no.
DOCTOR: So you started with Inspector MacKenzie.
JOSIAH: The cream of Scotland Yard.
DOCTOR: Primordial soup, the most precious substance in the universe, from which all life springs.
LIGHT: Merely sugars, proteins and amino acids. But it will soon start to evolve again, so I'm going to stop the change here. All organic life will be eradicated in the firestorm. And when this world is destroyed, no more change, no more evolution, no more life. No more amendments to my catalogue.
DOCTOR: But you evolve too, Light.
LIGHT: Nonsense!
DOCTOR: Of course you do. You change, adapt, all the time. Your attitude, your place, your mind. I mean, look at you now. You're no longer your original shape. And I don't think much about your catalogue. It's full of gaps.
LIGHT: All organic life is recorded.
DOCTOR: What about the gryphons, the basilisks?
DOCTOR: You missed the dragons, the bandersnatches. Then there are the slithy toves and the crowned Saxe-Coburg.
LIGHT: Where are these items?
DOCTOR: I can't think how you missed them. You have to complete the catalogue before you can destroy all life here.
LIGHT: Control?
DOCTOR: She's no use to you now. She's evolved as well.
LIGHT: No! All slipping away.
DOCTOR: All is change, all is movement. Tell me, Light, haven't you just changed your location?
LIGHT: Not yet.
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Light, changed your mind?
LIGHT: You are endlessly agitating, unceasingly mischievous. Will you never stop?
DOCTOR: I suppose I could. It would make a change.
LIGHT: Nimrod! I can rely on you. Assist me now.
NIMROD: I'm sorry, sir. My allegiance is to this planet, my birthright.
LIGHT: Argh! Everything is changing. All in flux. Nothing remains the same.
DOCTOR: Even remains change. It's this planet. It can't help itself.
LIGHT: I will not change. I'll wake up soon. No change. Dead.
DOCTOR: Subject for catalogue. File under Imagination comma lack of.
NIMROD: Excuse me, sir, but Light instigated the firestorm programme sometime prior to dinner.
DOCTOR: Ah.
ACE: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: A very big explosion, very soon.
ACE: How do we stop it? Same as before?
DOCTOR: Ace, don't touch that.
ACE: It'll nuke Earth.
DOCTOR: Look.
ACE: Fine time to watch a video.
DOCTOR: How does this ship travel?
ACE: Speed of thought. It's alive.
DOCTOR: Yes. Light's gone. The ship survives, along with a new crew.
JOSIAH: Turn off the power, Doctor.
ACE: Get off, scumbag!
JOSIAH: I'll have my empire yet.
DOCTOR: Josiah, the ship doesn't want you to.
REDVERS: There's a place for you here, old chap.
CONTROL: Stop that immediately. Get back where you belong.
DOCTOR: There go the rungs in his evolutionary ladder.
ACE: Go on, then. Evolve your way out of that one.
JOSIAH: No way out now. No changing.
CONTROL: You are the most unhappy creature. I shall look after you.
ACE: They swapped over.
NIMROD: We have our work to do, sir. Entries and amendments to revise to complete the catalogue.
ACE: No nukes, then? Isn't it going to explode?
DOCTOR: Explode or fly. I mean, after all, it is a spaceship.
NIMROD: The energy will be redeployed for our departure, sir.
REDVERS: Redvers has the whole universe to explore for his catalogue. New horizons, wondrous beasts, light years from Zanzibar.
CONTROL: Doctor, something tells me you are not in our catalogue, nor will you ever be.
DOCTOR: You're busy. Must fly.
ACE: Bye, bye.
DOCTOR: Come on.
REDVERS: Bye.
ACE: We've got to get clear for the take-off.
DOCTOR: Take off? They've gone, like a passing thought. As long as their minds don't wander.
DOCTOR: He's dispersed.
ACE: For ever?
DOCTOR: The house will remember. Just the ghost of an evil memory lingering. A dark secret after the candle is out.
ACE: I felt it here in a hundred years time.
DOCTOR: An evil older than time itself.
ACE: So I burnt the house down.
DOCTOR: Any regrets?
ACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yes?
ACE: I wish I'd blown it up instead.
DOCTOR: Wicked.
