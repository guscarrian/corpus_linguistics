The Movie
DOCTOR : It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil was read and sentence passed. Then he made his last, and I thought somewhat curious, request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Time Lord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey.
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate.
DOCTOR : It was a request they should never have granted.
DOCTOR : The Time Lord has thirteen lives and the Master had used all of his, but rules never meant much to him. So I stowed his remains safely away for the voyage back, because even in death I couldn't trust him.
DOCTOR 7: There, that should do it.
DOCTOR : In all my travels through space and time, and nearing the end of my seventh life, I was finally beginning to realise that you could never be too careful.
SINGER: It was a beautiful sight. Your kiss was a flame, not the spot that somehow dies.
SINGER: Was real as all those tears I cried.
SINGER: Each time I wake, knowing you're not here.
SINGER: But what can I do?
SINGER: Time, time, time.
DOCTOR 7: Oh, no.
LEE: Hey! Where you going, man? Come back here. Wimp!
GANGSTER: Say your prayers, Lee!
GANGSTER: What was that thing?
DOCTOR 7: Timing malfunction.
LEE: I'll get you an ambulance.
DOCTOR: Stop it! Stop it.
LEE: What? Here it comes. Hold in there, old guy. Chang Lee'll help you.
LEE: Hey, over here!
BRUCE: Were you with him when it happened?
LEE: Yeah, we were just passing.
BRUCE: Is he rich? Cos where we're going, he'd better be rich. Here.
LEE: Hey, I'm not signing anything, Mister.
BRUCE: Sign, or we can't do nothing. Come on.
LEE: What's the date?
BRUCE: December thirtieth.
LEE: 1999.
BRUCE: Three gunshot wounds. Heart's going crazy. Must have taken something.
CURTIS: Two hearts?
WHEELER: One bullet went straight through his shoulder. No damage. The other two are in his left leg.
CURTIS: Look, two hearts.
SALINGER: As if! It's a double exposure, Curtis. Let's get those bullets out, then.
WHEELER: This one went straight through.
WHEELER: Heart's still going like crazy.
SALINGER: Well, we'll have to bring in cardiology.
CURTIS: Who's on tonight?
SALINGER: Amazing Grace.
GRACE:  I've got to go. Excuse me.
SALINGER: Fibrillation at three hundred.
GRACE: Three hundred? No blockages showing?
SALINGER: No.
GRACE: X-rays?
SALINGER: NG.
GRACE: What?
SALINGER: Double exposed every time we try.
GRACE: Well then, try again.
SALINGER: We're getting another machine up. It'll take about another half hour.
GRACE: We don't have time for that. We've got to get moving on this.
CURTIS: Doctor Holloway, it's Brian.
GRACE: Oh. Yeah, Brian. I'm sorry. Listen, I am on call. What do you expect me to do, ignore it? No. No, Brian, don't say that. Listen, just wait until I get home. Brian? Argh.
CURTIS: Sorry.
GRACE: Probe.
WHEELER: Probe.
GRACE: Scalpel.
WHEELER: Scalpel.
GRACE: And straight to track four.
CURTIS: Track four coming up.
DOCTOR 7: Puccini. Madame Butterfly.
DOCTOR 7: Whatever you're about to do, stop. 
GRACE: Mister Smith, you're going to be all right.
DOCTOR 7: No. I am not human. I am not like as you.
GRACE: Nobody is, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR 7: I need a beryllium atomic clock. This 1999, isn't it?
SALINGER: We can't wait any longer, Grace.
DOCTOR 7: No, I'm not human. I'm not human.
CURTIS: It's okay, I've got it.
GRACE: Try not to speak, Mister Smith. We've already taken out all the bullets, and now we're going to listen to your heart, find out why it's so wild, and then I'm going to fix it. You'll be fine. Okay, he's under.
DOCTOR 7: Timing malfunction. The Master, he's out there. He's out there.
GRACE: Scalpel.
DOCTOR 7: I've got to stop him.
GRACE: Somehow I don't think this man's name is Mister Smith, do you?
SWIFT: And here we have an electro-physiology being performed by one of our senior cardiologists, Doctor Holloway, who will insert a micro-surgical probe into the patient's artery, then search out the short-circuiting part causing the fibrillation, and just so that you know your money is being well spent, we'll blast it with lasers.
SALINGER: So, is Brian threatening to leave again?
GRACE: He won't. That's strange.
Grace looks at the monitor showing the probe's view of the Doctor's vascular system.)
SALINGER: What?
GRACE: D�j� vu. Where am I?
SALINGER: Er, sub-clavian.
GRACE: I should be in the broncheo-cephalic.
SALINGER: Not unless this man's a donkey.
GRACE: Then I am lost. Let me try something.
SALINGER: Massive seizure! Get that probe out of there.
GRACE: I'm trying!
CURTIS: Picture's out.
GRACE: Damn it!
WHEELER: We're dropping off fast.
SALINGER: Just pull it out!
GRACE: Come to me!
SALINGER: Get it out now, Grace.
GRACE: It's no good, I can't get it out of him.
SALINGER: Grace, he's flat�lining.
GRACE: The probe's snapped. It's still in him.
SALINGER: Clear! Clear! Clear!
SALINGER: Clear! Clear! Give me three hundred. Clear!
SALINGER: Clear! It's no good. Time of death?
CURTIS: Ten oh three.
GRACE: I got lost. I want to see his x-rays now!
SALINGER: Grace.
WHEELER: This is all his stuff. There's no identification there either.
GRACE: Tag him as John Doe and book him for an autopsy.
WHEELER: You want me to bring that kid in? Maybe he can help us with an identification. Doctor?
GRACE: Sure.
GRACE: This is no double exposure.
WHEELER: Sir?
LEE: Yeah, I'm up.
WHEELER: Would you just come with me, please?
LEE: You're the doctor? 
GRACE: Yes. Yes, I am. Are you a friend of Mister Smith's?
LEE: Yeah. Is he okay?
GRACE: Actually, there were some complications and I'm afraid he didn't make it. I'm sorry.
LEE: It's okay. I'll tell his family. Are these his things?
GRACE: Yeah.
LEE: I'll take them.
GRACE: Er, maybe we should contact the family ourselves.
LEE: No, miss, this'll hit them really hard. I'll tell them.
GRACE: You don't know this man at all, do you.
LEE: Yeah, I do.
GRACE: Then tell me his real name.
LEE: I got to go.
GRACE: Wait!
GRACE: Someone stop him!
MIRANDA: Shut up. Bruce, please.
PETE: You doing anything special New Years Eve?
TED: Going to the costume party.
PETE: Oh, yeah. Me too. Who are you going as?
TED: Wild Bill Hickok.
PETE: Oh right, cool. Who's that?
PETE: John Doe on the toe. We've got to nice autopsy booked for you tomorrow morning, Mister, followed by a sauna or a Swedish herbal wrap. What would be your pleasure? One a.m. Hey, it's December thirty first 1999. Party on!
PETE: Sweet dreams.
PETE: Hey, look out!
FRANKENSTEIN: It's alive. It's alive. It's alive!
FRANKENSTEIN: It's alive! In the name of
PETE: Hey, Ted, is that you?
PETE: Hello?
PETE: Who's there?
PETE: Oh my god! God, no!
DOCTOR: Argh! Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
TANNOY: Doctor Anderson to emergency room four. Doctor Anderson please report to emergency room four.
PETE : Oh yeah? What are you going as?
TED : Wild Bill Hickok.
PETE : Right.
LEE: Weird.
BRUCE: I must find the Doctor. This body won't last long. I need the Doctor's body.
MIRANDA: A sense of humour. No more snoring. You don't need a doctor. Come back to bed, honey.
BRUCE: My name is not Honey.
MIRANDA: Oh well, what would you like me to call you, then?
BRUCE: Master will do.
MIRANDA: Well, come back to bed, Master.
MASTER: Oh, Doctor. Soon I will have all your lives.
PETE: It wasn't the same guy. 
GRACE: Sounds like you saw the man who stole the body.
PETE: He was wearing a shroud and a JD tag on his toe.
GRACE: Somehow I don't think the second coming happens here.
PETE: Right. You think he's going to go to a better hospital! Know what? I'm going home.
GRACE: Hey, Pete. Stop by Psychiatric and pick up some more mind-altering drugs.
PETE: Okay, sure.
GRACE: Can you get SFPD in on this? Some creep's made off with the John Doe that died last night. 
CURTIS: Ew. Body snatchers.
SWIFT: Don't call the police yet, Curtis. Grace, can you give me some time?
DOCTOR: Time.
DOCTOR: Time!
DOCTOR: Time.
SWIFT: We don't need to advertise our mistakes, do we?
GRACE: What are you saying?
SWIFT: Two hearts. No wonder you got lost.
GRACE: Exactly.
SWIFT: Or maybe this really was a double exposure. In either case, I can't afford to lose you.
GRACE: What are you doing?
SWIFT: What I should have done last night.
GRACE: Am I having a bad dream here? I lose a patient, and then I lose his body, and now you have just destroyed the only proof that
SWIFT: That you were careless?
GRACE: No, that I had no way of knowing
SWIFT: Stop! A man died last night because you lost your way.
GRACE: You bet I did. You saw the x-ray. The guy had two hearts.
SWIFT: But now, without a body or without the records, no one need know he was even here.
GRACE: You can't do this!
SWIFT: Let me take care of this, Grace.
GRACE: No!
SWIFT: Believe me, I know what is best for all of us.
GRACE: But what was he? How can we learn from him? I've got to find his body.
SWIFT: And I have to keep this hospital open.
GRACE: No! No. If you do this, I'll quit.
SWIFT: You don't mean that.
GRACE: Hold the elevator.
DOCTOR: Puccini! We've met before.
GRACE: I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think so. I know you. You're tired of life, but afraid of dying.
DOCTOR: There was music. Madame Butterfly. You were there! I saw you last night!
GRACE: It wasn't me.
DOCTOR: I don't know who I am, but I know you know me.
GRACE: Please go away.
DOCTOR: Please, you're my only hope.
GRACE: I'll call security!
DOCTOR: Do you know who I am?
GRACE: I don't care who you are. Leave me alone!
DOCTOR: Please, you must help me. You're a doctor.
GRACE: Well, my oath just expired. Stand back.
GRACE: Argh! Get out! Get out!
DOCTOR: Its my hearts!
DOCTOR: There's something in here.
GRACE: It can't be.
DOCTOR: What is this? What is it?
DOCTOR: Please, please, I have two hearts, You have to get me out of here before they kill me again. Please, please, you have to help me. Drive! 
CURTIS: Hey, Bruce. Why the shades?
MASTER: I had a bad night.
CURTIS: Did you want something?
MASTER: What happened to the gunshot wound I brought in? I've got orders to move him.
CURTIS: He died.
MASTER: Oh, yeah. Well, I've got orders to move his body.
MASTER: Where is it? His body?
CURTIS: Well, haven't you heard? The body is gone. Stolen.
MASTER: Okay, where are his things?
CURTIS: The kid that brought him in ran off with them.
MASTER: The Asian child.
CURTIS: The Asian child? Bruce, you're sick.
MASTER: Thank you.
GRACE: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Better, yes.
GRACE: Good.
DOCTOR: Now I don't have a piece of primitive wiring inside my cardiovascular system.
GRACE: Primitive.
GRACE: I don't believe it! He's taken all his stuff!
DOCTOR: Who?
GRACE: Brian.
DOCTOR: Your boyfriend?
GRACE: Ex- boyfriend. Listen, why don't you just have a seat and open your shirt. I want to listen to your heart.
DOCTOR: Hearts. Plural.
GRACE: Right. Right. He's taken the sofa! Come on, follow me.
DOCTOR: Now I'm remembering more.
GRACE: Good.
DOCTOR: Lovely view.
GRACE: Maybe you had selective amnesia brought on by shock.
DOCTOR: Maybe. I can't remember.
DOCTOR: Ah, Da Vinci. He had a cold when he drew that.
GRACE: You're still fibrillating badly.
DOCTOR: No, I'm not. Here.
DOCTOR: I remember! I was with Puccini before he died.
GRACE: Name dropper.
DOCTOR: No, I was, I was, I was.
GRACE: Shush. Oh, my god.
DOCTOR: You see? That's no echo. He died before he could finish Turandot. Alfano finished it based on his notes. It was so sad.
GRACE: You have two hearts. Who are you?
DOCTOR: I was dead too long this time. The anaesthetic almost destroyed the regenerative process.
GRACE: Yeah, right. I'm going to get a syringe. I'm going to take some blood. I want to know what's going on here.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace. Don't you see? I have thirteen lives.
GRACE: Please! Okay, you're trying to tell me that you've come back from the dead.
DOCTOR: Yes.
GRACE: No, sorry. The dead stay dead. You can't turn back time.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can.
GRACE: I'm not a child. Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Only children believe that crap. I am a doctor.
DOCTOR: But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamt you could hold back death. Isn't that true? Don't be sad, Grace. You'll do great things.
Lee ducks under the crime scene tape, unlocks the Tardis and goes inside. Then he walks straight back out again, all round the outside and back in.)
LEE: Hello? Who's there? The guy from the ambulance? Bruce, don't scare me like that. This place is freaky enough.
MASTER: Chang Lee. That's your name, isn't it?
MASTER: Well, I never. The Tardis really likes you.
LEE: What are you talking about, Bruce?
MASTER: I am not Bruce. It took me a minute with the talking and the walking, but I am not Bruce. I am merely inside his body.
LEE: Oh, yeah? So, er, who are you really?
MASTER: Give me the bag. Yes.
MASTER: Now, where is he?
LEE: Who?
MASTER: The man you stole these things from, where is he?
LEE: Those are mine now. He's dead.
MASTER: He's not dead! He has stolen my body.
LEE: But
MASTER: And I will die unless we bring him back here. You're going to help me do that, do you understand?
LEE: What's in it for me?
MASTER: You get to live.
DOCTOR: Mmm, not bad. Did these belong to
GRACE: Brian? Yep. Keep 'em.
DOCTOR: Thank you. How's my blood?
GRACE: It's not blood.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Perhaps if I walk in them, stretch them a bit, they'll fit me better.
GRACE: Good idea. Let's go for a walk.
GRACE: Maybe you're the result of some weird genetic experiment.
DOCTOR: I don't think so.
GRACE: Well, you have no recollection of family.
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait. I remember I'm with my father, lying back in the grass. It's a warm Gallifreyan night.
GRACE: Gallifreyan?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey! Yes, this must be where I live. Now, where is that?
GRACE: I've never heard of it. What do you remember?
DOCTOR: A meteor storm. The sky above us was dancing with lights. Purple, green and brilliant yellow! Yes!
GRACE: What?
DOCTOR: These shoes! They fit perfectly. Yes.
MASTER: You know, this was all mine until he stole it from me. He should never have been allowed to be here.
LEE: You know, I was told he was dead.
MASTER: That body had died, but now he's regenerated into another one. My body can do this twelve times, but he's taken most of my regenerations.
LEE: What did he do with them?
MASTER: Unspeakable crimes.
LEE: Like what?
MASTER: Genghis Khan.
LEE: What about him?
MASTER: That was him.
LEE: No way!
MASTER: Yes, way. Look, I'm no saint, but he is evil, and he's doing it all with my body. I was on the verge of stopping him when we got here. What do you want, Lee?
LEE: What do you mean?
MASTER: If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be?
LEE: I don't know. A million bucks.
MASTER: Only a million?
LEE: Okay, two million.
MASTER: Think bigger.
LEE: A billion dollars!
MASTER: And what would that buy you?
LEE: Power.
MASTER: Power.
LEE: Gold dust?
MASTER: You get the rest when I get my body back. Deal?
LEE: Deal.
MASTER: Let me show you around. Go ahead.
LEE: Whoa! How did I do that?
MASTER: I told you, the Tardis likes you. The Cloister Room.
LEE: Awesome!
MASTER: Isn't it? Come, let me show you.
MASTER: Here is the Eye of Harmony, the heart of the structure. Everything gets its power from here.
LEE: So how can it help us find him?
MASTER: Well, as you know, it used to belong to me, but now it belongs to him. If we can open the Eye, we'll find him.
LEE: Cool. So, you going to open it?
MASTER: No, you are. See if you can pull this reflector staff from it's mooring.
LEE: This thing?
MASTER: You can do it.
MASTER: Yes.
MASTER: Good. Now, look in the beam of light. If the Tardis really likes you, the Eye will open.
LEE: Why don't you look?
MASTER: You pulled the staff from the stone.
GRACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: Something's happening. Something's happening. Something's happening.
GRACE: Oh my god.
DOCTOR: I know who I am!
DOCTOR: I am the Doctor!
GRACE: Good! Now do that again.
LEE: Whoa! There's the guy I took to the hospital.
MASTER: The Doctor's past live.
LEE: The Doctor?
MASTER: That's what he calls himself. Doctor.
MASTER: The new Doctor.
LEE: He's so young.
MASTER: Fascinating. See that? That's the retinal structure of the human eye. The Doctor is half human! No wonder.
DOCTOR: No.
GRACE: What?
DOCTOR: No. I saw him. The Master is here.
GRACE: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: He's planning to take my body, so that he will live and I will die! Oh, no! He has opened the Eye of Harmony.
GRACE: What is the Eye of Harmony?
DOCTOR: Wait, wait.
MASTER: There, we're seeing what he's seeing.
LEE: I know that woman.
DOCTOR [OC: I mustn't let him see you, but it may be too late.
GRACE: What's the Eye of Harmony?
DOCTOR: The power source at the heart of the Tardis.
GRACE: The Tardis? What's a Tardis?
DOCTOR: The Tardis is my ship that carries me through time and space. T A R D I S. It stands for Time and Relative Dimension In Space.
GRACE: And this Master's like the Devil?
DOCTOR: The Master is a rival Time Lord.
GRACE: Time Lord? Oh, my God.
DOCTOR: Pure evil. I was bringing home his remains from Skaro, where his final incarnation had exterminated by the Daleks, or so we thought.
GRACE: You really are insane, aren't you.
DOCTOR: He wasn't dead. It's a trap. Don't you see? It's a trap. He wants me to look into the Eye. If I look into the Eye of Harmony
DOCTOR : My soul will be destroyed and he will take my body!
MASTER: Listen to all those lies. My young friend.
LEE: Does she believe him?
GRACE: I don't want to deal with this.
DOCTOR: Grace, listen!
GRACE: That's enough!
DOCTOR: If the Eye of Harmony isn't closed, this planet will be sucked through it! Grace, I need to fix the timing mechanism on the Tardis and close the Eye. I need an atomic clock. Grace, please, help me find one.
DOCTOR: Grace. Grace. Grace!
MASTER: So that's how he intends to destroy me.
LEE: How?
MASTER: We must get to the Doctor before he finds a clock.
LEE: I know that woman. She was the surgeon who operated on him last night.
MASTER: Find her, we'll find him.
DOCTOR: Grace!
GRACE: Just stay away from me!
DOCTOR: Come on, Grace, please let me in.
GRACE: No!
DOCTOR: Grace, let me in. We can sit down, we can have a cup of tea, we can talk about this reasonably.
GRACE: Sure, Time lord to Earthling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. I am a Time Lord.
GRACE: I thought you were a doctor.
DOCTOR: I thought you were a doctor!
GRACE: I am calling an ambulance to take you back to Psychiatric from which you have obviously escaped!
DOCTOR: Grace, we don't have time for this. The Eye of Harmony is open. If I don't close it, get my Tardis and the Master off this planet, this planet will no longer exist!
GRACE: I'm calling the ambulance.
DOCTOR: Grace, we have until midnight.
GRACE: Come on, come on. Yes, yes, I'll hold.
DOCTOR: Grace, I shall prove that the Eye of Harmony is open. Look at this.
GRACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: You see? Already the molecular structure of the planet is changing.
GRACE: I'm going to need an ambulance as soon as possible. This is Doctor Grace Holloway.
DOCTOR: At first in subtle ways, but soon in catastrophic ways.
GRACE: I need a bed in Psychiatric.
DOCTOR: By midnight tonight, this planet will be pulled inside out.
DOCTOR: There will be nothing left.
GRACE: I think you'd better make that two beds.
MASTER: Doctor, Doctor. Come on, she needs an ambulance.
DOCTOR: Grace. Grace, I've lost twenty pounds.
GRACE: Congratulations.
DOCTOR: In twenty minutes? It's starting.
GRACE: You'd make a fortune in the weight-loss business, Doctor.
TELEVISION: Strange natural phenomena. Since early this evening, Bay Area tides have risen to levels that break all records for this time of year. Flood warnings have gone out along the Napa and Russian rivers, and believe it or not, in Hawaii it has even started snowing.
DOCTOR: Grace, look!
TELEVISION: You may be wondering what this has to do with the millennium. Scientists say that the freak conditions are due to the very slight fluctuations in the Earth's gravitational pull. Fluctuations that apparently only happen once every thousand years. Here's what our cameras in Hawaii
DOCTOR: I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there.
TELEVISION: And most fashionable San Franciscans are going tonight to ring in the new year. And of course, you'll be there, won't you?
TELEVISION 2: Naturally. Now, didn't you say they'll see a clock getting started?
TELEVISION: That's right, and you know, it isn't just any old clock. It happens to be the most accurate atomic clock in the world, and it's right here in the Institute of Technological Advancement and Research in downtown San Francisco, so don't go away. 
DOCTOR: That must be a beryllium clock.
GRACE: They're here.
DOCTOR: Excellent! They can take us straight to the Institute.
DOCTOR: We need to go directly to the Institute of Technological Advancement and Research. Do you know where that is?
MASTER: Of course I do.
DOCTOR: What time is now?
GRACE: Half past ten. Don't worry, I'm on the Board of Trustees at the Institute. They'll listen to me.
DOCTOR: Won't this go any faster? Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
GRACE: Can't you give him a sedative?
DOCTOR: Grace, why didn't you say you had access to a beryllium clock?
GRACE: I was more concerned about the Eye of Destruction.
DOCTOR: Harmony!
GRACE: Yes, yes. And the fact that the planet will be sucked through it at midnight. I mean, face it. It's not often one has a Time Lord in one's living room, Doctor.  He likes me to call him Doctor.
MASTER: Well
GRACE: You know, Freud had name for that.
MASTER: Transference.
DOCTOR: Yes, very witty, Grace. At least Freud would taken me seriously.
GRACE: He'd have hung up his pipe if he'd met you.
DOCTOR: We did meet.
GRACE: Oh, that's right. He's a Time Lord.
DOCTOR: We got on very well.
GRACE: Did you know Madame Curie, too?
DOCTOR: Intimately.
GRACE: Did she kiss as good as me?
MASTER: As well as you.
GRACE: A truck's blocking all the lanes.
DOCTOR: This planet is going to be destroyed and I'm stuck in a traffic jam. Excuse me.
GRACE: Oh, my god!
GRACE: Oh my god, what is it!
DOCTOR: Get out. Get out now!
GRACE: What is it?
DOCTOR: Get out now!
MASTER: I can't be injured like this! Get it off me! Get it off me!
POLICEMAN: Sir, ma'am, go back to your vehicle.
GRACE: What? Stop! He's er, he's British.
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose I am. Jelly baby, officer?
POLICEMAN: Jelly baby?
GRACE: Just take it.
DOCTOR: Now, would you stand aside before I shoot myself.
POLICEMAN: Don't be a fool.
DOCTOR: Are you with me, Grace?
GRACE: We don't stand a chance.
DOCTOR: Would you excuse me, please? Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today.
GRACE: Give me the gun.
GRACE: Okay, give him the keys.
POLICEMAN: Now listen, pal. I know life can deal you a bad hand sometimes, but this is no way to solve your problems.
DRIVERS: Give them the keys! 
DOCTOR: Thank you.
MASTER: What are we waiting for?
LEE: The road's still blocked.
MASTER: This is an ambulance!
LEE: Right.
GRACE: Maybe I should have kept the gun.
DOCTOR: What?
GRACE: Look!
GRACE: Doctor, look out!
DOCTOR: Breath in, Grace.
LEE: Don't worry.
MASTER: I'm not worried.
MASTER: What are you doing?
LEE: This way's quicker.
MASTER: It better be.
LEE: Look, this is my town. I know what I'm doing. Trust me.
MASTER: Faster.
LEE: So what's the plan, anyway?
MASTER: We'll let him get to the clock, then we'll get his body.
GRACE: I think we lost them!
DOCTOR: Good. Hold on.
LEE: Hey, man, when I get all that gold, you know what I'm going to do?
MASTER: I don't want to know.
LEE: You kill me.
MASTER: You want me to kill you?
LEE: No! No, I mean you make me laugh, man. You're a funny guy.
MASTER: I'm glad one of us is amused.
LEE: Hey, look, cheer up, man. You'll get your body back soon. We're a team, right?
MASTER: Yes, we're a team.
 
GRACE: Not again! Oh great. I finally meet the right guy and he's from another planet.
GRACE: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
GRACE: I only have one life. Could you remember that?
DOCTOR: I'll try.
GRACE: Thank you.
GRACE: Oh, no. Doctor, look.
GRACE: Doctor Grace Holloway and guest. Thank you.
GRACE: First time being on the board of this place has ever done me any good.
DOCTOR: He must have found a back way in. I can't see him.
SECURITY: Sorry. No one beyond this point.
GRACE: Oh, this is Doctor Bowman from London. They're waiting for him. Come on.
SECURITY: You'll be allowed in with everyone else.
GRACE: I'm on the Board of Trustees.
GRACE: Thank you very much. Come on.
TANNOY: Welcome to the Institute of Technological Advancement and Research. After dinner, Professor Wagg will invite you to join him in celebrating the official starting of the world's most accurate timepiece, the San Francisco Beryllium Atomic Clock.
GRACE:  How will we get up there on the back of a bike?
DOCTOR:  We only need the tiniest piece of it.
GRACE:  People are starting to stare. Why don't we just make conversation?  So, time travel's possible?
DOCTOR: Anything's possible.
GRACE: And why don't you have the ability to transform yourself into another species like the
DOCTOR: Well, I do, but only when I die.
GRACE: And that rival Time Lord, the Master?
DOCTOR: He's on his last life, fighting to survive. And the science has shown us over and over, in the fight for survival there are no rules. Also, Grace, if I tell you a secret, you must promise not to tell.
GRACE: Oh, Professor Wagg. This is Doctor Bowman. He's from London. He was just going to share a secret with us.
DOCTOR: Yes. Er, Professor, is there a chance of a closer look at the clock?
WAGG: No! No, I'm afraid that I am the only person allowed up there.
DOCTOR: Oh, can't you just bend the rules a little?
WAGG: No.
DOCTOR: Oh, but you see
WAGG: Grace says you have a big secret. What is it?
DOCTOR: I'm half human. On my mother's side.
WAGG: Very clever. Happy New Year.
GRACE: Yes, I think you must be.
WAITER: Champagne?
GRACE: Oh
DOCTOR: Grace.
GRACE: Oh.
DOCTOR: This is when I wish I had my sonic screwdriver.
GRACE: What?
DOCTOR: See? I told you it was small.
GRACE: What is it they say?
DOCTOR: Yes, they say it on my planet, too.
DOCTOR: I know you.
GARETH: You do, huh?
DOCTOR: Gareth, answer the second question on you mid-term exam, not the third. The third may look easier, but you'll mess it up.
GARETH: What?
DOCTOR: Remember, answer the second question. Don't forget!
GARETH: I won't. Now, can I see what's in your hand, sir?
GRACE: What was that about?
DOCTOR: Ten years from now, Gareth will head the Seismology unit of the UCLA Task Force, and devise a system of accurately predicting earthquakes. 
GRACE: You mean that, don't you?
DOCTOR: Of course. His inventions save the human race several times, but first he must graduate in poetry.
GRACE: Look, there's the kid who took your stuff.
DOCTOR: You see who he's with? Come on.
GRACE: The Master?
DOCTOR: You're lucky he only got your wrist.
GRACE: Why did you do that?
DOCTOR: Liven things up. Come on!
GRACE: Door!
DOCTOR: You're not afraid of heights, are you?
GRACE: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So am I.
WAGG: Everyone stay calm! Remain inside! Don't panic! Everything is under control.
SECURITY: You go upstairs, I'll see to the exits.
MASTER: Doctor!
GRACE: Here we go again.
GRACE: So, do you know what's going happen to me?
DOCTOR: You don't want to know.
GRACE: Right. You can't not tell me!
DOCTOR: Grace.
GRACE: Oh, God! Brian's going to move in again.
DOCTOR: I can't say.
GRACE: Please?
DOCTOR: The universe hangs by such a fragile thread of coincidences. It's useless to meddle with it, unless, like me, you're a Time Lord.
GRACE: All right. So just give me few pointers.
DOCTOR: There she is.
GRACE: A police box?
DOCTOR: Key.
GRACE: Now I always leave a spare key
BOTH: In a secret compartment above the door.
DOCTOR: Great minds think alike. Up you go. It's in a cubbyhole above the P.
GRACE: Got it. Why a police box?
DOCTOR: Its cloaking device got stuck on a previous misadventure, but I like it like this.
GRACE: Doctor.
POLICEMAN: I haven't got any brakes!
GRACE: Oh, my.
GRACE: Wow!
DOCTOR: You hear that?
GRACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: That's a warning. The Tardis is dying.
GRACE: This is amazing.
DOCTOR: This is no good. We don't even have enough auxiliary power to move next door.
DOCTOR: The beryllium chip. Grace.
GRACE: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Careful
GRACE: Yes, Doctor.
GRACE: This looks pretty low-tech.
DOCTOR: Low tech? Grace, this is a Type Forty Tardis, able to take you to any planet in the universe and to any date in that planet's existence. Temporal physics.
GRACE: Oh, you mean like interdimensional transference. That would explain the spatial displacement we experienced as we passed over the threshold.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you like.
DOCTOR: Yes!
DOCTOR: Come on! Oh, no.
GRACE: What?
DOCTOR: I've a horrible feeling we're already too late.
GRACE: It's 11:48. We still have eleven minutes.
DOCTOR: There's no context. Hold on.
GRACE: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: I'm setting coordinates for one minute after midnight.
GRACE: Why?
DOCTOR: If this is true, the Eye has been open too long and there is no future. I only hope. Oh, no!
GRACE: Is this thing reliable?
DOCTOR: Whatever's happening can't be stopped by closing the Eye.
GRACE: Well, how come you didn't know that?
DOCTOR: I haven't opened the Eye before.
GRACE: Now you tell me.
DOCTOR: Grace, closing the Eye may not be enough. We have to go back to before the Eye was opened. Maybe even before we arrived.
GRACE: This is a time-machine.
DOCTOR: With no power.
GRACE: What?
DOCTOR: The Eye being open so long must have drained the Tardis.
GRACE: Great!
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
GRACE: You must have the power to get back. You must!
DOCTOR: Not enough.
GRACE: What about all those glorious predictions? All that knowledge about what's going to happen to Gareth, to me, to this city? That must come from somewhere. Think!
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Are you any good at setting alarm clocks?
GRACE: No.
DOCTOR: Grace!
GRACE: I'll try.
DOCTOR: Listen very carefully.
GRACE: Okay.
DOCTOR: We pre-set the coordinates just as I divert the power from within the Eye itself into the time rotor here.
GRACE: We jump-start the Tardis?
DOCTOR: We jump-start the Tardis.
GRACE: What do I do?
DOCTOR: Hit the top switch on the console there. The top one.
DOCTOR: Good. Now pass me the neutron ram. Grace? Grace, the neutron ram. Look, I'll show you.
DOCTOR: Oh, no. Oh, not you, Grace. This is no time to play doctors and nurses.
LEE: It's no good talking to her. She's possessed.
DOCTOR: You! You took my things. Where are they?
LEE: They're not your things any more. Pretty soon, everything round here's going to belong to the Master again.
DOCTOR: Again? What's he been telling you?
LEE: When he gets his body back from you, when he has body back from you, I'm going to be rich.
DOCTOR: And you believe him?
LEE: Why shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: I suppose he neglected to mention that there won't be any place to spend your money?
MASTER: Which is why we have no time to waste.
DOCTOR: Time enough to change.
MASTER: I always dress for the occasion.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad to see that you are aware of the gravity of the situation.
MASTER: I never liked this planet, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, that's good, because any minute now it shall cease to exist. What's the time?
MASTER: Time enough for me to get my body, get out of here, and take Lee with me. Lee is the son I have always yearned for.
DOCTOR: Oh, please.
MASTER: Grace, put it on him. I suspect you know how.
DOCTOR: Lee, this is my Tardis. This is my Eye and I'm in my own body. The Master has run out of all his lives. Now he plans to steal mine. That's the truth!
DOCTOR: Look at Grace. She's possessed by evil, not goodness.
MASTER: This won't hurt. Much.
WHEELER: I didn't think I would make it.
WAGG: My life's work. Om. Om.
DOCTOR: In seven hundred years no one has managed to open the Eye. How did you do it?
MASTER: Simple. Lee is human, you are only half. Lee, open the Eye for me, please.
WAGG: Ladies and gentleman, in three minutes the world will enter a new millennium, and with it a new standard of accuracy will come to how we measure time.
WAGG: What do you mean, it won't start?
DOCTOR: Lee, this is you last chance!
LEE: This is my only chance.
MASTER: He's right, Doctor. There's nothing for him here. No family, no gang, only death. But with me, he gets see the universe.
DOCTOR: This is his last chance to stay alive and you know it.
MASTER: What do you know of last chances?
DOCTOR: More than you!
MASTER: I've wasted all my lives because of you, Doctor, and I will be rid of you.
DOCTOR: All your lives! Didn't you tell Lee I'd stolen your lives? Lee, he's lying. He's used all his lives. Now he wants mine. Like I told you, this is my Tardis, this my body.
MASTER: Don't believe him. Open the Eye.
DOCTOR: He said it himself, Lee. He's wasted his lives, all of them.
MASTER: Open the Eye! 
LEE: No! You lied to me!
MASTER: Lee, Lee, I would never lie to you. I would only protect you.
DOCTOR: No!
DOCTOR: How will you open the Eye now?
MASTER: Grace, come here.
DOCTOR: Unless I'm mistaken, in her present state of mind that won't work! Her eye's aren't human any more.
MASTER: Watch.
MASTER: See? Now they're human.
DOCTOR: No! Grace, close your eyes!
MASTER: Too late!
GRACE: I'm blind!
DOCTOR: Your sight will return, Grace!
GRACE: What's happening?
DOCTOR: He can't move as long as the eye links us. Remember, Grace! Remember!
GRACE: Re-route the power!
DOCTOR: In the Console Room. Go.
GRACE: But you'll die if I leave you!
DOCTOR: We'll all die if you don't! Run! Run, Grace!
MASTER: I'm taking your lives, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Run!
MASTER: I can hear your thoughts, Doctor. I can feel your memories.
DOCTOR: This cannot be how it ends. Stop this. Please. Stop!
GRACE: God, please. What have I done?
PETE: Thirty seconds!
ALL: Twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty seven, twenty six, twenty five
WAGG: Twenty, nineteen, eighteen
DOCTOR: No.
PETE: Seventeen, sixteen, fifteen
ALL: Twelve, eleven, ten
GRACE: And I thought surgery was difficult.
WAGG: Nine,
PETE: Eight!
GRACE: Rerouting the power.
MASTER: I'm alive!
ALL: Seven!
GRACE: Re-routing the power.
WAGG: Six.
MASTER: I'm alive! I'm alive!
TELEVISION: That's all the time we have.
PETE: Three!
MASTER: I am alive!
WAGG: One!
DOCTOR : We have to go back to before the Eye was opened, maybe before we arrived!
GRACE: Alarm clock, alarm clock, think alarm clock!
GRACE: Temporal orbit? What's a temporal orbit?
DOCTOR: She did it. Your life force is dying, Master.
MASTER: Nooooooo!
GRACE: We're in temporal orbit, Doctor. What is it? What is that?
DOCTOR: Grace! No!
DOCTOR: Grace.
MASTER: You are my life.
DOCTOR: You want dominion over the living, yet all you do is kill!
MASTER: Life is wasted on the living!
DOCTOR: Give me your hand!
MASTER: Never!
MASTER: Doctor!
LEE: Doctor, I have your things.
DOCTOR: Hello, Grace. Well, how does it feel to hold back death?
LEE: So, where's the Master?
DOCTOR: Indigestion. So, let's see where we are. There. The future.
LEE: Wow.
DOCTOR: Look over there, on the other side of your galaxy. That's home.
GRACE: Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: Two hundred and fifty million light years away. That's a good ten minutes in this old thing.
GRACE: So, where are we?
DOCTOR: December twenty ninth. Do you want to get off here?
GRACE: I don't think I could live through that again,
LEE: I definitely wouldn't live through that again.
DOCTOR: Reason enough.
PETE: That's not funny.
ALL: Ten!
ALL: Nine! Eight! Seven!
WAGG: Six! Five!
ALL: Four! Three!
WAGG: Two! One!
TELEVISION: Have a happy new year.
TELEVISION 2: Happy new year. Can you believe it? Two thousand.
DOCTOR: Now that's as it should be.
LEE: Your things.
DOCTOR: Oh! My sonic screwdriver. Thank you.
LEE: And these, too.
DOCTOR: Please, keep them.
LEE: Really?
DOCTOR: Yes, really.
LEE: I'd better go before you change your mind.
DOCTOR: Lee! Next Christmas, take a vacation. Just don't be here.
LEE: Right! Thanks. Thanks, Doctor! See you around, Grace. Happy new year!
GRACE: There you go, interfering again.
DOCTOR: Grace, something you should know
GRACE: Don't tell me.
DOCTOR: Why not?
GRACE: I know who I am, and that's enough.
DOCTOR: I'm glad. Come with me.
GRACE: You come with me.
DOCTOR: Me come with you?
GRACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Me come with you? It's tempting.
GRACE: I'm going to miss you.
DOCTOR: How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember.
GRACE: That's not what I meant.
GRACE: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Sounds better. Right, where to next?
DOCTOR: Now, where was I?
DOCTOR: Oh no, not again.
