Terror of the Vervoids
Part Nine
INQUISITOR: We are all aware of your feelings of sorrow, Doctor. Has the recess given you sufficient time to overcome the distress of your bereavement?
DOCTOR: I doubt that there will ever be sufficient time for that, my lady.
VALEYARD: May we not proceed, my lady? The cavalier manner in which the Doctor permitted his young companion to be destroyed militates against this charade of concern.
INQUISITOR: The Doctor is fighting for his life, Valeyard. However, I do take your point. Doctor, are you ready to present your evidence?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am grateful to you, madam, for according me the same privilege as the Valeyard that allowed me access to the Matrix. My excursion will be into the future.
VALEYARD: The future? Is it going to be the Doctor's defence that he improves?
DOCTOR: Precisely.
VALEYARD: This I must see.
DOCTOR: My submission concerns a crisis which threatens the lives not only of a group of people confined together with no means of escape, but would, if unresolved, threaten every mortal being on the planet Earth.
INQUISITOR: Proceed.
DOCTOR: Mogar, a planet on the Perseus arm of the Milky Way.
DOCTOR : Rich in rare metals. A top priority consignment of these precious metals is being loaded aboard Hyperion Three, an intergalactic liner that ferries between Mogar and Earth. A scheduled flight in the Earth year two thousand nine hundred and eighty six.
DOCTOR : The crew is aboard. The last passengers are reporting in. Many will never complete the journey, for, in order to protect a secret hidden on the space liner, one will become a murderer.
LASKY: Am I expected to trust my life for millions of millions of miles to a bunch of incompetents who can't even get my luggage aboard without losing it?
JANET: Your luggage, Professor? It's not in your cabin?
LASKY: Really, do I have to repeat myself?
JANET: I'm sure we can sort it out.
RUDGE: Problems, Janet? Let me help.
LASKY: And who are you?
RUDGE: Security Officer Rudge, Professor. Now, which cabin did you go to?
LASKY: You're asking, and you're the Security Officer? Cabin six, where else?
RUDGE: May I see your key, please?
RUDGE: Ah, no. The other way round, I think. You are in cabin nine, and that is where you will find your luggage, Professor.
LASKY: Let's hope so.
JANET: You're in cabin six, Mister Grenville.
GRENVILLE: Thank you.
RUDGE: Mister Grenville, Security Officer Rudge. If you have any problems
KIMBER: Mister Hallett, how pleasant. At least one face not belonging to a stranger.
GRENVILLE: I'm sorry, I think you must be mistaken.
KIMBER: Oh, surely not. We met three years ago on Stella Stora. You came to investigate shortages in the granary.
GRENVILLE: My name is Grenville, and I've never been to Stella Stora. You're obviously confusing me with someone else.
RUDGE: Maybe the gentleman has a doppelganger.
KIMBER: But I could have sworn. Even the voice is the same.
BRUCHNER: An investigator?
LASKY: Bruchner, go and check the safety measures for the Isolation room, immediately.
GUARD: That's the final batch. Get your men ashore.
 
VALEYARD: An objection.
INQUISITOR: Relevant, I hope.
VALEYARD: Completely. When, may we ask, is the Doctor going to embroil himself in this saga?
DOCTOR: Now I object. Am I not to be protected from the prosecutor's insinuations? On what evidence does he conclude that I embroil myself?
INQUISITOR: None. I shall ignore his terminology. But I do confess I share his curiosity.
DOCTOR: I fail to see why you're so curious, madam. Surely you must know where my Tardis is?
VALEYARD: Obscurity is a recognised tactic for subterfuge.
DOCTOR: And posing unnecessary questions in order to score cheap points is the tactic of a prosecutor who has no case. You have been monitoring my Tardis. You claim it's been bugged with a listening device. So you tell the court where my Tardis is.
INQUISITOR: I require you to respond to the challenge, Valeyard.
VALEYARD: It has entered the sector the Hyperion Three is traversing.
COMPUTER: Hyperion flight one one three is now in progress.
MEL: Twenty three, twenty four, twenty five
MEL + DOCTOR: Twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty, thirty one, thirty two, thirty three, thirty four
DOCTOR: Thirty five, thirty six, thirty seven, thirty eight
MEL + DOCTOR: Thirty nine, forty.
MEL: This will wake you up.
DOCTOR: Carrot juice?
MEL: It'll do you good. Honestly, carrots are full of vitamin A.
DOCTOR: Mel, have you studied my ears lately?
MEL: It's your waistline I'm concerned about.
DOCTOR: No, no, seriously, though. Is it my imagination or have they started to grow longer?
MEL: Listen, when I start to call you Neddy, then you can worry. Drink up.
DOCTOR: You'll worry sooner when I start to bray.
JANET: Perhaps when you've unpacked, you'd like to join the other passengers in the lounge for refreshments.
JANET: You startled me.
JANET: You haven't got your translator switched on, sir.
ATZA: Why did we not depart on schedule?
JANET: We were delayed for a late arrival. A gentleman from your planet, as a matter of fact.
ATZA: A Mogarian?
JANET: Yes, sir.
JANET: Anything interesting?
EDWARDES: Maybe. Unidentified craft. I've tried all the standard frequencies.
JANET: Without response?
EDWARDES: Not a bleep.
JANET: Perhaps it's a piece of space flotsam.
EDWARDES: You make delicious coffee, Janet.
JANET: Oh, well, if you don't want the benefit of my advice.
EDWARDES: Let's try you on hyper-frequency.
MEL: Sixty nine, seventy, seventy one, seventy two
DOCTOR: Quickly, Mel, press the red button. Get the message on the screen. Press it. Press it!
MEL: I have. You said red.
DOCTOR: Did I? Must be the carrot juice making me colour blind.
MEL: Colour blind?
MEL: Cryptic.
DOCTOR: Unsigned.
MEL: Mayday call? We have to respond.
DOCTOR: Practically on our doorstep.
MEL: Come on, Doctor. Come on, hurry.
DOCTOR: How I keep up with you is a constant source of amazement to me.
MEL: No one sends a mayday call unless it's a matter of life and death.
DOCTOR: Yes. Let's exercise the grey cells for once, shall we, rather than the muscles.
DOCTOR: That was no ordinary mayday call. It was beamed specifically at the Tardis.
MEL: So it's from someone who knows you.
DOCTOR: In which case, why wasn't it signed?
MEL: Panic? Desperation. Well, we won't find out by hanging about in here, will we?
DOCTOR: We won't go blundering into a trap, either.
MEL: I've never seen this side of you before. You're usually the one who goes charging in regardless.
DOCTOR: Can't you sense it, Mel?
MEL: Sense what?
DOCTOR: Evil. There's evil in this place.
DOCTOR: I've got a better idea. Let's go to Pyro Shika, a fascinating planet
MEL: Doctor!
MEL: Doctor.
DOCTOR: So much for your enthusiasm. Let me do the talking.
DOCTOR: Now listen, my man, I can explain. We're
GUARD: Shut up. Move.
DOCTOR: I said I can explain.
GUARD: And I said move.
DOCTOR: He did, didn't he.
MEL: You certainly talked us out of trouble there.
RUDGE: You never heard anything?
EDWARDES: Not a sound.
RUDGE: Nor saw anything?
EDWARDES: I've already told you.
RUDGE: No one's blaming you, laddie, but I thought perhaps now that your head is clearer.
EDWARDES: I was concentrating on the unidentified craft.
RUDGE: From which you failed to get a response.
TRAVERS: Mister Edwardes, what about the security tape?
EDWARDES: Deactivated, sir.
TRAVERS: Which indicates knowledge of our procedures.
RUDGE: Just my thoughts too, Commodore.
TRAVERS: I'm sure. How about the rest of the equipment?
EDWARDES: In perfect order, sir.
TRAVERS: That leaves only one objective your assailant could have had.
RUDGE: To send a message.
TRAVERS: I was trying not to state the obvious, Mister Rudge. That'll do. Report to the medic before returning to duty.
EDWARDES: Thank you, sir.
DOCTOR: Will you please stop poking that contraption into my spine.
GUARD: We heard a noise in the cargo hold, Mister Rudge, and found these two.
DOCTOR: Is it? Yes, it is. Captain Tonker Travers.
TRAVERS: Commodore.
DOCTOR: Oh.
TRAVERS: Of all the places in this infinite universe, you have to turn up on my ship.
DOCTOR: Commodore? That means this is a grade one security craft.
RUDGE: Yes, and I should like to know how you got here.
TRAVERS: Don't bother, Rudge. I know how. What I don't know is why.
DOCTOR: But didn't you send the mayday call?
TRAVERS: Me?
MEL: We had to respond.
EDWARDES: That's true, sir.
TRAVERS: I am fully conversant with the navigational code, Mister Edwardes. I thought you were reporting to the medic.
EDWARDES: Yes, sir.
TRAVERS: I authorised no mayday signal. My Communications officer is attacked and then you appear.
MEL: And a fat lot of thanks we've got for our pains.
TRAVERS: If I seem to lack gratitude, young woman
DOCTOR: Melanie. Known as Mel.
TRAVERS: It is because on the previous occasion that the Doctor's path crossed mine, I found myself involved in a web of mayhem and intrigue.
DOCTOR: Ah, saved your ship, though, Commodore.
TRAVERS: Yes, you did, though whether it would have been at risk without your intervention is another matter.
MEL: Whatever happened in the past doesn't alter the fact that a mayday call was sent.
DOCTOR: Not by you, though, Commodore, so let's make this hail and farewell, shall we?
TRAVERS: Stand easy, Doctor. You're not leaving.
DOCTOR: We're not?
TRAVERS: I'd rather have you where I can see you than swanning around outside. Conduct them to the lounge. Consider yourself restricted to passenger quarters.
MEL: In other words, welcome aboard.
RUDGE: Stowaways. I could have done without that on my final service report.
TRAVERS: If you're expecting an easy ride on your last voyage, Mister, I'm afraid you're not going to get it.
RUDGE: I think you're being a mite unfair, sir.
TRAVERS: Am I? Well, don't be too diligent in policing the Doctor.
RUDGE: Can I have clarification of that instruction, sir.
TRAVERS: Give him enough rope and he will snare our culprit for us.
DOCTOR: Far cry from the carefree life of Pease Pottage, eh, Mel?
MEL: I'm not complaining. You're really worried, aren't you?
DOCTOR: I can't rid myself of the feeling I'm being used. Whoever sent that message knew me.
MEL: There's a made to measure candidate.
DOCTOR: There is?
MEL: The Commodore. He's met you before.
DOCTOR: He'd have said.
MEL: Would he admit he needs outside assistance?
DOCTOR: Intriguing possibility, but that's all.
MEL: Look, the quickest way out of this is to solve the mystery.
DOCTOR: That could also be the quickest way into trouble.
MEL: Why don't you ask for a passenger list?
DOCTOR: Don't hustle me, Mel.
MEL: Who's hustling? All I'm saying is that you might recognise a name. Simple, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Meanwhile?
MEL: Meanwhile, I wander around, poke my nose into a few nooks and crannie and see if anyone tries to make contact. Remember, we were restricted to the passenger quarters. This is only the lounge.
RUDGE: Looking for something, miss?
MEL: I see you've a gymnasium.
RUDGE: Needed on a long trip like this.
MEL: I thought I might do a bit of limbering up.
RUDGE: That's the spirit. Let me take you there.
MEL: So you can keep tabs on me?
RUDGE: Why would I want to do that?
MEL: This way?
DOCTOR: I wonder if you can help me.
JANET: I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: I'd like to see a copy of the passenger list.
RUDGE: Put the headset on, Miss.
RUDGE: Sorry. If you get tired of aerobics, just select another tape. They come complete with instructions and music.
MEL: Thank you.
DOLAND: Professor, we have a problem in the Hydroponic Centre.
LASKY: The Hydroponic Centre? What's happened?
DOLAND: It's been broken into.
LASKY: Get Bruchner down there. He's in the Isolation Room.
MEL: Yes? Yes, I heard, but who's speaking?
JANET: You're very persuasive, Doctor, but I can't possibly
JANET: Ah, here's the man who could give you permission.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, don't bother.
RUDGE: Permission for what?
DOCTOR: Ah, it's not important. It's just a whim. I'm subject to whims, so I'm told.
JANET: The Doctor wants a passenger list.
RUDGE: Why not? Indeed, the idea makes good sense.
DOCTOR: Mmm. Well, if I could I could just spot a familiar name
RUDGE: We'd get our culprit, you'd bid us farewell. I should have thought of that myself, Doctor. Sign of age. I'm due to retire after this voyage.
DOCTOR: No, no, all complete strangers, I'm afraid.
RUDGE: Pity.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
MEL: He's been in touch. He wants you to meet him in cabin six.
DOCTOR: Did you see him, get a name?
MEL: No, just a message. Let's go.
DOCTOR: Now, before you go rushing off, Mel, do you know what a Judas goat is?
MEL: Er, yes. It's a decoy goat that's tied to the stake to lure the tiger out into the open.
DOCTOR: Getting badly mauled in the process. I think I shall refuse the role.
MEL: Then where are you going?
DOCTOR: For a non-provocative stroll around the deck.
MEL: But what about cabin six?
DOCTOR: Tiger trap.
LASKY: You appalling dunderhead, Doland. Couldn't you have repaired this?
DOLAND: I assumed you'd want to see the damage for yourself, Professor.
LASKY: And I suppose it never penetrated your thick academic skull to check the pods.
DOLAND: That was the first thing I did. They're stable.
BRUCHNER: Professor Lasky! The Demeter seeds, they're gone.
MEL: Hello? Anyone at home?
DOCTOR: You're not supposed to be in here.
MEL: And what about you?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
MEL: Going for a stroll? You just said that to put me off.
DOCTOR: Well, there's no sense in putting two heads into the noose.
MEL: Ever heard of safety in numbers?
DOCTOR: Hmm.
MEL: Looks like someone's been in a fight for their life.
DOCTOR: Yes. The question is, did they succeed?
TRAVERS: Yes?
RUDGE : Would you come down, sir?
TRAVERS: Where?
RUDGE : Waste disposal unit. There's been an accident.
TRAVERS: Accident? Can't you deal with it?
RUDGE : I think you should be here, sir.
TRAVERS: Very well. What I have done to be landed with him, I fail to comprehend. Take over.
DOCTOR: What is it?
JANET: Emergency in the waste disposal unit.
MEL: This way.
DOCTOR: Yeah, this way.
 
TRAVERS: I see. Cut the klaxon. Accident? Why can't you use plain language, mister? Whoever's been dumped in there has been pulverised into fragments and sent floating in space, and in my book that's murder. Have you called a medic for this man?
RUDGE: Of course, sir. Straight away.
TRAVERS: Then I suggest you begin earning your salary and find out who that belongs to.
DOCTOR: I may be able to help you there, Commodore.
TRAVERS: Somehow, that doesn't surprise me.
DOCTOR: If you'd rather I left it to Mister Rudge?
MEL: The passenger in cabin six sent for the Doctor. When we got there, he was gone.
TRAVERS: Doesn't follow that he wound up in the pulveriser.
DOCTOR: The room was a wreck.
MEL: And there was a single shoe, exactly the same pattern as that.
DOCTOR: To be complete, the syllogism only requires its grim conclusion.
TRAVERS: And naturally you have never met the man or know why he sent for you.
MEL: We don't even know his name.
RUDGE: It was Grenville, sir. A mineralogist.
TRAVERS: Any suggestions why a mineralogist who wanted to see you should be killed?
DOCTOR: None at all.
TRAVERS: Or why it is that every time you appear on the scene, people begin to die?
MEL: Hey, I don't care who you are, you've no right to say that to the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, he does, Mel. He has every right. It happens to be true.
LASKY: Well?
LASKY: Never mind them. Is the Isolation Room safe?
BRUCHNER: Yes, the emergency was in the waste disposal unit.
LASKY: Then we can relax. Nothing to do with us.
BRUCHNER: That's your assessment, is it, Professor? The danger's passed?
DOCTOR: Well, that's it, then. End of the line.
MEL: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Well, our contact. Obviously he's the one who's been pulverised.
MEL: So we give up?
DOCTOR: What else?
MEL: The Hydroponic Centre. I told you about the sudden panic when I was in here.
DOCTOR: Irrelevant and immaterial.
MEL What?
DOCTOR: My dear Melanie, if you wish to pursue this completely arbitrary course, pray hurry along to the Hydroponic Centre and leave me to my static and solitary peregrinations.
DOCTOR: Hold it! Just a minute, I don't remember that.
INQUISITOR: How could you remember? These events are in your future.
DOCTOR: But, I reviewed that section earlier when I was preparing my defence. There have been changes. That isn't what happened. The girl, Melanie. Her information was important. I wouldn't have just ignored it. Completely uncharacteristic. And the words, misused, didn't even sound like mine.
VALEYARD: What isn't completely uncharacteristic is this resort to excuses and subterfuge. To gloss over the death of Peri, the Doctor conveniently presents us with another companion.
INQUISITOR: Hardly a convenience, Valeyard. These events are in the Doctor's future. He would not have met the young woman yet.
VALEYARD: I stand corrected. But my assumption of why he has pursued such an arbitrary course in aborting this tale still remains.
DOCTOR: Arbitrary course?
INQUISITOR: Your assumption, Valeyard?
VALEYARD: That she, too, is going to her death.
DOCTOR: No! No, look, I'm sorry, madam, I can't explain, but I have a feeling I am being manipulated, that the evidence is being distorted.
VALEYARD: Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous! Forgive me, Sagacity. The idea the Matrix could lie. No, it is we who are being manipulated.
DOCTOR: No!
VALEYARD: To obscure the damaging truth.
DOCTOR: No, this is total fabrication.
VALEYARD: The truth, Doctor! You sent your companion down the cargo hold into a situation which you described, I quote, can't you sense it, Mel? Evil. There's evil in this place.
DOCTOR: No! No, this is all wrong. Every instinct of which I am capable would have made me prevent her.
VALEYARD: Yet you did not.
INQUISITOR: Doctor, either you continue with your submission or I must consider the evidence for the defence to be concluded.
EDWARDES: What are you doing prowling around down here?
MEL: Prowling? Why should I be prowling?
EDWARDES: Because this if off-limits, and I suspect you know it.
MEL: I just wanted to have a peep at the Hydroponics Centre.
EDWARDES: Any reason in particular?
MEL: I think it might tie in with that mysterious mayday call. I'm not going to touch anything. What harm could it do?
EDWARDES: I'll no doubt regret this, but come on, a conducted tour only. No wandering off on your own.
MEL: Tell me, who's the woman with the dragon's voice?
EDWARDES: Professor Sarah Lasky. She's an agronomist. So are her two assistants, Bruchner and Doland.
MEL: So was the Hydroponics Centre set up specially for them?
EDWARDES: Yes, we had to allocate part of the hold.
MEL: Why is only low spectrum light allowed in the place?
EDWARDES: Something to do with photosynthesis. Low spectrum light allows the plants to stay dormant.
EDWARDES: Now, I'll go first. We don't want you breaking your neck. At least, not until
Part Ten
GUARD: What are you doing here? You were told not to come down
MEL: Back there! Edwardes, he's dead! He just touched the fences.
GUARD: Save your explanations for the Commodore, lady.
GUARD 2: He's dead, all right.
GUARD: Stay with him. I'll send help. Move.
VALEYARD: Another death, Doctor? But for the caprice of chance, the victim would have been your companion, Mel. Your culpability is beyond question.
INQUISITOR: You could have prevented her from going into the cargo hold. Instead, you appear to encourage her.
DOCTOR: When I viewed the Matrix earlier, that isn't what happened.
VALEYARD: More futile grasping at straws. When the facts tell against you, you cry fraud.
INQUISITOR: Do you wish to reconsider, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, madam. I am being manipulated, but the only way to discover why, and by whom, is to press on.
DOLAND: Just an accident. No cause for concern. The stewardess will take care of that.
LASKY: Why aren't you wearing a pulsometer? The heart should be monitored while exercising.
DOCTOR: Which heart would you suggest, madam? Unfortunately, that doesn't register a double pulse.
LASKY: A double pulse? What are you, a comedian?
DOCTOR: No, more a sort of clown, actually. Would you care to hear my rendering of On With The Motley?
RUDGE: Doctor, you're required on the bridge.
DOCTOR: Ah! The Commodore wants a chat. Good, I shall enjoy that.
RUDGE: I don't think you'll find enjoyment's on the agenda.
MEL: I don't need anyone to speak up for me. I'm quite capable of defending myself.
TRAVERS: How long have you known this woman?
DOCTOR: Er, time is a comparative concept, Commodore.
MEL: Not now, Doctor. Just answer the question.
TRAVERS: I should accept that advice and drop the sophistry. Can you vouch for her?
DOCTOR: Completely. Utterly. What's all this about, Mel?
MEL: The Communication's officer's dead, and they think I did it.
RUDGE: She was caught running from the scene. She can't deny that.
MEL: I haven't tried. I persuaded Edwardes to show me the Hydroponic Centre. It was booby-trapped.
DOCTOR: Booby-trapped?
MEL: If it hadn't been for Edwardes, it would have been me who was killed.
RUDGE:  What? are you certain?
TRAVERS: What is it?
RUDGE: It's the medical team. They say they can't find Edwardes anywhere in the hold, sir.
MEL: But he must be there.
DOCTOR: Or perhaps he wasn't dead. The weird atmosphere down there could lead to phantasmagoria.
MEL: Oh, come on, you know me. Am I prone to that sort of imagination?
DOCTOR: Well.
TRAVERS: I thought you'd left a man down there.
GUARD: I did, sir.
TRAVERS: Well, where is he? Rudge?
RUDGE: They say there's no sign of him either, sir.
MEL: The guard's disappeared too? Well, now perhaps you'll accept that I'm not responsible. You've had me in custody!
DOCTOR: The perfect alibi, Commodore.
TRAVERS: Organise a search, Mister Rudge. I want those men found.
RUDGE: Yes, sir.
TRAVERS: Now, since you've put in an appearance, first a passenger, now my communications officer and a guard have gone missing. Two, if not all three, murdered. You, standing there in your divine state of innocence, you can't tell me what's happening, can you?
MEL: I can. The answer's simple enough. You've got a killer on board.
MEL: Look, Doctor, you can't just play a passive role. We were sent for, remember?
DOCTOR: I'm cogitating.
MEL: About what?
DOCTOR: Whether his job is to keep unwanted visitors out or
MEL: Keep someone in.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Intriguing, isn't it.
MEL: Does seem strange, I admit. An armed guard outside an Isolation Room.
BRUCHNER: No matter how you and Professor Lasky rationalise the situation, we should never have proceeded to the point we've reached.
DOLAND: How you became a scientist, Bruchner, baffles me. You have the temperament of an overcautious rabbit. Did you leave the gates open?
BRUCHNER: Doland, the pods!
BRUCHNER: Every one of them. Empty.
DOLAND: Some fool must have introduced high intensity light into the Centre.
BRUCHNER: We're confronted with a catastrophe and that's your reaction? Don't you realise what's been unleashed?
RUDGE: Not again.
JANET: What's going on in there?
RUDGE: Don't ask me, I'm only the Security officer.
MEL: Where are they?
DOCTOR: Where are who?
MEL: You know exactly what I mean. Where are the seeds? The ones you picked up in the wrecked cabin, or did you think I'd forgotten.
DOCTOR: Uh huh.
MEL: Oh, come on.
DOCTOR: What do you want them for?
MEL: Professor Lasky. She's an agronomist. I'm going to ask her.
DOCTOR: Is she? An agronomist, huh? You'd better leave me to cope with this.
MEL: You?
DOCTOR: Mmm. This is a situation that requires tact and finesse. Fortunately, I am blessed with both.
DOCTOR: Professor Lasky.
LASKY: Oh, it's you, the comedian. What do you want?
DOCTOR: I understand that you're an agronomist.
LASKY: A thremmatologist, to be precise.
DOCTOR: A thremmatologist? Then you're well qualified to tell me about these.
LASKY: Stewardess! Stewardess!
JANET: Something wrong, Professor?
LASKY: Fetch the Security officer.
JANET: Can I help?
LASKY: At once!
JANET: May I be told what's wrong, Professor?
LASKY: This man's a thief.
JANET: Mister Rudge to the passenger lounge, please.
MEL: Tact. Finesse. Now what have you landed us in?
BRUCHNER: What was that?
DOLAND: Nothing. Pull yourself together, Bruchner.
BRUCHNER: There's someone in the hold.
DOLAND: Bruchner, you're allowing hysteria to take
BRUCHNER: I know what I saw. There was a movement.
LASKY: That puts an entirely different complexion on the situation. Pity your friend the comedian wasn't as lucid.
DOCTOR: I never had a chance to be
LASKY: I can't understand why they were in cabin six, or why a mineralogist would steal them.
MEL: Are they special, Professor?
DOCTOR: Yes, just what I was going to
LASKY: Demeter seeds? Yes, they are. They represent a tremendous advance, a colossal leap.
DOCTOR: Do they?
MEL: What did you call them? The Demeter seeds?
DOCTOR: The name of a god
LASKY: Food of the gods. Bruchner, my assistant, bit of a romantic, highly strung, he christened them.
DOCTOR: That still doesn't explain
LASKY: He wasn't just being pretentious. They'll increase potential yield threefold. And even more, they'll grow in desert sand.
RUDGE: Er.
LASKY: What is it, man? Don't stand there hovering.
DOCTOR: You sent for him.
LASKY: I did? Oh, yes. Not to worry.
RUDGE: But I do worry, especially when serious allegations are made. You accused the Doctor of being a thief.
LASKY: Oh, that. A mistake. The fellow may be a fool, but he's not a criminal.
TRAVERS: Project our course through the sector ahead. Put us onto a straighter course. Reduce the diversion to a point naught three safety margin.
OFFICER: I estimate that brings our ETA forward by seventy two hours, sir.
TRAVERS: Seventy two hours closer to getting expert investigators on board. Carry on.
MEL: No, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No.
KIMBER: No, thank you.
TRAVERS: No need for concern. Just a navigational adjustment. As you can see, it doesn't even require my presence on the bridge. Now, for your information, the change of course will bring our landfall forward by seventy two hours.
TRAVERS: Switch on your translator.
ATZA: Surely we are approaching the sector with the Black Hole of Tartarus.
TRAVERS: That's correct.
ATZA: If you are saving time, we must be going closer to the black hole.
TRAVERS: There's no danger. The safety margin is more than adequate.
ORTEZO: That is hardly a denial.
ENZU: Simply a bromide.
TRAVERS: You sought reassurance, I've given it.
ORTEZO: That word reassurance, bears sinister undertones for we Mogarians.
TRAVERS: Indeed?
ORTEZO: It is the word the Earthlings used when first they persuaded us to allow them to sink mines on Mogar.
ATZA: A limited concession was all they requested, and now they are stripping our planet bare.
ENZU: Truth is a stranger to the Earthlings.
TRAVERS: If you'll excuse me, politics do not come into my realm of influence.
DOCTOR: Then they should.
ATZA: Who are you? Another prospector?
DOCTOR: Only of knowledge. I have visited your planet. It's very rich in natural resources.
ORTEZO: Which will soon be exhausted if these Earthlings are not restrained. They are going through the universe like a plague of interplanetary locusts.
VALEYARD: Are we to be subjected to a dissertation on interplanetary politics now, Sagacity?
DOCTOR: Is that all you think it was?
VALEYARD: Mining rights, Mogarians versus Earthlings. What else would you call that?
DOCTOR: You are so pathetically intent on incriminating me you haven't been watching what's going on!
VALEYARD: My eyes never left the screen.
DOCTOR: Well, you may have been selected to prosecute me, Valeyard, but I hope you'll never be chosen to defend me.
VALEYARD: An occasion that will not arise, Doctor. Your lives are forfeit, as I have ably proven.
DOCTOR: Something vital just happened in that scene, and the Valeyard perversely switched our attention to more trivial matters.
VALEYARD: Then for pity's sake tell us what it was that happened and enjoy your moment of triumph.
DOCTOR: Triumph? There's no cause for celebration. One of the occupants of that lounge is about to die.
VALEYARD: Another murder?
DOCTOR: Yes. And if you had been watching, you would know who was the intended victim.
INQUISITOR: Gentlemen, is this case to be resolved with a battle of words or to be conducted via the Matrix?
TRAVERS: You've drawn a blank where Edwardes is concerned?
RUDGE: Yes, sir. Perhaps we should search the passenger cabins.
TRAVERS: No. The passengers are already uneasy. Do you want them to realise they're trapped with a killer on the loose?
DOCTOR: You're very quiet, Mel. Not quite your style to go into a brown study.
MEL: Brown study? Is the vocabulary of all the Time Lords so antediluvian?
TRAVERS: Are you trying to kill him?
DOCTOR: I'm trying to save him!
ATZA: He will die if you remove his helmet.
RUDGE: Mogarians can't breathe oxygen. Surely you're aware of that?
DOCTOR: He's not a Mogarian!
MEL: He's not?
TRAVERS: Then who is he?
DOCTOR: If you'll kindly allow me to remove his face plate? I fear this poor fellow is beyond help.
JANET: It's Grenville!
DOCTOR: Grenville?
RUDGE: The passenger from cabin six.
TRAVERS: The man who's supposed to have been dumped in the pulveriser.
DOCTOR: His name isn't Grenville. It's Hallett.
TRAVERS: Send a stretcher party to the lounge.
OFFICER: Yes, sir. I'll organise that immediately.
TRAVERS: Carry on, Mister Rudge.
KIMBER: Poor Mister Hallett. I knew it was Hallett. I recognised him, remember?
DOCTOR: You recognised him?
KIMBER: Yes.
RUDGE: But he denied it. He insisted his name was Grenville.
DOCTOR: Well, he would.
MEL: Well, whether his name's Grenville or Hallett, why did he stage his own death in the pulveriser?
DOCTOR: This gentleman's just given us the answer.
KIMBER: I have?
DOCTOR: Hallett had presumably been assigned to investigate something or somebody on this ship. Then he had the bad fortune to be recognised. A chance encounter that put his entire mission in jeopardy.
RUDGE: Are you saying we had an undercover agent aboard and I wasn't informed?
DOCTOR: Well, you may have been a suspect.
RUDGE: Me?
DOCTOR: Together with everyone else on this voyage.
RUDGE: Is all this guesswork, or have you any more tricks up your sleeve?
DOCTOR: No tricks, Mister Rudge. I knew Hallett, and admired him. But I assure you, until I removed that face plate I had no idea he was on board.
RUDGE: All nice and lily white, Doctor, but it does leave one nasty little problem.
DOCTOR: It does?
RUDGE: How did you know the dead man wasn't a Mogarian?
VALEYARD: Yes, how did you know? Have you been editing the Matrix and denying the court all the evidence to which it is entitled?
INQUISITOR: That would be a serious offence, Doctor.
DOCTOR: At the risk of appearing impertinent, Sagacity, I would point out that you, the Valeyard, and everyone here present could have acquired the same knowledge.
INQUISITOR: Perhaps we may hear your explanation.
DOCTOR: With respect, you will not hear it from me.
TRAVERS : Switch on your translator.
ATZA : Surely we are approaching the sector with the Black Hole of Tartarus.
TRAVERS : There's no danger. The safety margin is more than adequate.
ORTEZO : That is hardly a denial.
ENZU : Simply a bromide.
DOCTOR: As you saw, the bogus Mogarian did not switch on his translator.
VALEYARD: Very astute of you, Doctor, but don't stop there. Let us assume the murdered man was responsible for the mayday call. Perhaps you'll now direct your deductive gifts towards justifying his extraordinary behaviour.
INQUISITOR: Yes, the investigator Hallett's methods were very unorthodox.
DOCTOR: Agreed, and I am indebted to the prosecutor for putting his finger on the nub of my defence, the reason why I could no longer stay on the sidelines.
MEL: Anyone there could have poisoned his drink.
DOCTOR: Providing us with a plethora of suspects.
MEL: Us? Do I detect a commitment at last? Because of Hallett's death? You said you admired him.
DOCTOR: I did. He was one of a rare breed. A maverick. Even the highly organised society of the thirtieth century has need of his kind. He'll be missed. And he left these seeds for me to find.
MEL: To lead you to where I've been telling you all along. The Hydroponic Centre.
BRUCHNER: What are you doing away from your post? The Isolation room is under no circumstances to be left unguarded. If it happens again, I shall report you to the Commodore.
MEL: Hallett must have sent that mayday call.
DOCTOR: Yes, he wanted me here as a catalyst, and to divert attention away from his own activities.
MEL: You'd do that without being asked.
DOCTOR: Hallett was an unorthodox man, but he was also a subtle man. So why did he resort to such blunderbuss tactics? Why use me as a Judas goat?
MEL: Well, he was running out of time. The mayday message said as much. Perative traitor be identified before landing Earth. I'd guess the incomplete word was imperative, wouldn't you?
DOCTOR: Do you know, I've always envied you that.
MEL: I shall probably regret this, but go on, I'll buy it. Envied me what?
DOCTOR: Your amazing ability for almost total recall.
MEL: Compliments. You are undergoing a change.
DOCTOR: I could have been comparing you to an elephant. Well, figuratively speaking. They never forget.
MEL: Doctor, I realise you're trying to take my mind off poor Edwardes.
DOCTOR: If you'd rather wait here
MEL: No.
MEL: What have you got there?
DOCTOR: A leaf from Hallett's pocket.
MEL: I didn't see you take it.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Neither did anyone else. Another one of my tricks.
DOCTOR: What do you make of these pods, Mel?
MEL: I'm not into agronomy. Ask the professor.
DOCTOR: Ah. Thremmatology. The professor said she was a thremmatologist.
MEL: You're going to have to enlighten me. It's out of my range.
DOCTOR: The science of breeding or propagating animals and plants under domestication.
MEL: I'm not much wiser.
DOCTOR: Well, think, Mel. You've got a good brain. Think.
DOCTOR: I wonder what came out of this?
BRUCHNER: Will you end this charade, this pathetic pretence at normality. Can't you accept we're on the brink of disaster?
DOLAND: Bruchner, will you stop panicking? Our work must remain secret whatever the cost.
BRUCHNER: You're completely without conscience, Doland, I'm aware of that, but I expected the professor to grasp the enormity of our folly.
DOLAND: So you're suggesting that we jeopardise years of scientific research for the sake of some hypothetical danger?
LASKY: Exactly. We've no reason to believe the results of our experiments are other than benign.
BRUCHNER: Benign? Have you been in the Isolation Room lately?
LASKY: An unfortunate mishap that has no relevance to this situation. In any case, it's academic now.
BRUCHNER: I lack your lofty detachment.
LASKY: Do you also lack loyalty, Bruchner, to your colleagues. Before we left Mogar, we agreed that our discovery should be divulged to no one, no one, until we reached Earth. Unless you have concrete evidence to prove there is danger, I expect you to keep your word.
BRUCHNER: You simply don't understand, do you. The crime we are committing in the name of science will make us infamous!
BRUCHNER: That's assuming there's anyone left to pass judgement.
JANET: Decided to get some rest, Mister Kimber?
KIMBER: Yes, though I doubt if I'll sleep. At my age, one doesn't like to be reminded of mortality.
JANET: May I fetch you a warm drink? It might help.
KIMBER: Thank you. That's very gracious.
JANET: It's the stewardess, sir.
JANET: I've brought your warm drink, sir. Shall I leave it on the dressing table?
DOCTOR: What's a thremmatologist doing in an isolation room wearing a surgical mask?
MEL: Seeing as there's only one way to find out, you've got two problems.
DOCTOR: Two?
MEL: Apart from getting rid of the guard, you're going to need a mask, and you can hardly ask the professor to lend you hers.
MEL: Did you hear that?
DOCTOR: Quickly, the lounge! There are passengers trapped! On the double, man! There are lives at stake.
Part Eleven
RUTH: No. Stop her. Stop Lasky.
RUTH: Got to stop her, stop her. Stop Lasky.
DOLAND: Out! Out!
DOCTOR: What's going on in there? What are you trying to hide? Will you please stop mauling me?
DOLAND: I should drop the innocent party act if I were you. Any moment now, that guard will be back. He's going to be even less enchanted by your antics.
MEL: Never mind the guard. That monstrosity, what is it in there?
DOCTOR: Does the Commodore know what's being isolated in there?
DOLAND: I don't know by whose authority you ask, but if it'll put a stop you your meddling, I'll explain. That monstrosity, as you call her, is my lab assistant, Ruth Baxter. We're taking her to Earth in the hope that we can reverse her condition. Our facilities on Mogar were too primitive.
MEL: What happened? How did she get in that state?
DOLAND: The experimental nature of our work entails some calculated risks.
DOCTOR: Calculated risks? Are you telling me that sad travesty is a statistical possibility?
MEL: The word should be criminal.
DOLAND: Very well, perhaps I should have said unforeseen. During a particularly delicate cross-fertilisation, a speck of pollen penetrated a minute scratch on my assistant's thumb. She should never have left the wound uncovered.
GUARD: There he is! Halt, or I'll fire.
RUDGE: Oh, Doctor, you do have the knack of landing yourself in hot water.
DOCTOR: Satiable curtiosity, like the Elephant's Child.
MEL: Never mind the Just So stories. That guard looks trigger happy to me.
RUDGE: Simply doing his duty, miss. The regulations are quite specific. Anyone setting off a false alarm on an intergalactic liner is to be arrested forthwith.
DOCTOR: No need to quote the book. I can explain.
RUDGE: Not to me, to the Commodore. He's expecting you. Take him.
DOCTOR: No, that's all right. I know the way.
MEL: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
MEL: That way.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. It's that way.
VALEYARD: Stop the Matrix. I fail to comprehend this evidence. The Doctor is on trial for his life, yet in his defence he presents us with a situation in which he is deliberately flouting accepted authority.
INQUISITOR: Much of your evidence does seem to contradict your stated aim, Doctor. Are you saying the Matrix is again being falsified?
DOCTOR: No. And if the Valeyard would exercise the same restraint as I showed during his presentation of his case against me
VALEYARD: Ha!
DOCTOR: And could suppress his bloodlust
INQUISITOR: Doctor! This court is dedicated to giving you a fair trial. Do not abuse its indulgence.
DOCTOR: I apologise.
INQUISITOR: The Matrix, Doctor. I suggest we return to the Hyperion Three.
TRAVERS: Bring us in closer. Reduce the margin by a factor of point naught one to naught two.
DOCTOR: Very narrow margin of safety, Commodore.
TRAVERS: Not to a ship of the Hyperion class.
DOCTOR: Still risky, though. Quirky phenomena, black holes. They can gulp with unpredictable turbulence.
TRAVERS: When I want your advice, I'll ask for it.  I'll handle this. Get back on duty.
TRAVERS: What I do want to hear from you is a reason why I shouldn't throw you in the brig. Fire alarms are not playthings for irresponsible buffoons.
JANET: Mister Rudge! Mister Rudge.
RUDGE: What is it, Janet?
JANET: Mister Kimber has disappeared. He didn't report to the fire assembly point and he's not in his cabin.
JANET: He hasn't touched the drink I brought him.
RUDGE: Well, maybe he just wandered off, absent minded.
JANET: Without his jacket or his watch?
RUDGE: Now, when did you last see him?
JANET: I didn't. See him, that is. He was in the shower. I spoke to him through the door.
JANET: Where can he have got to? With all these killings
RUDGE: That'll do. Pull yourself together. Going to pieces won't help. We'll search the passenger quarters before we start assuming the worst.
TRAVERS: A grim picture.
DOCTOR: I've no reason to lie, Commodore.
TRAVERS: I'm not questioning your honesty, simply your methods. However, I'm left with little alternative but to begin to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Begin? I take it you mean begin overtly to cooperate. You've been using me, Commodore. I would never have been allowed to run free if you hadn't condoned it.
TRAVERS: Fair comment.
DOCTOR: Frankly, I think you should notify the authorities about the death of the investigator Hallett, and insist on being given full details of his mission.
TRAVERS: You underestimate me to that extent, do you?
DOCTOR: Sorry. They refused.
TRAVERS: Top secret. By the time they've gone through channels, we'll probably have docked.
DOCTOR: Well, that can't happen.
TRAVERS: No one will be allowed to disembark. The murderer won't escape.
DOCTOR: Murderer? Yes. You'll let me know as soon as you get a reply?
TRAVERS: Certainly, Doctor. I'll match you for candour.
JANET: Did you find him?
RUDGE: Not a sign. And you?
RUDGE: I left a report we've lost another passenger. That'll improve the Commodore's temper, I'll guarantee.
ATZA: Mister Rudge.
RUDGE: Er, later.
ATZA: Wait. Come here. We want to know what is happening.
ORTEZO: Yes, where was the fire?
RUDGE: It was a false alarm. There is nothing to worry about. You must excuse me. I have urgent things to do.
ORTEZO: Sit down, Rudge.
ATZA: There is only one thing you have got to do.
ORTEZO: That is to tell us exactly what is going on.
ATZA: And I suggest you do so right now.
TRAVERS: Yes? What is it?
TRAVERS : State your position.
VERVOID: Help me with this.
TRAVERS: Who the blazes was that? Trace that call.
DOLAND: Have you gone out of your mind?
BRUCHNER: I have been, but not any more. I've regained my sanity.
DOLAND: It's not only your own work you're destroying. Other people have contributed. You've no right to do this!
BRUCHNER: You long ago lost sight of the difference between right and wrong.
DOLAND: Why? Because of some unexplained incidents?
BRUCHNER: On my way down here, I heard of another unexplained incident. That harmless old man is missing. How many more, Doland, before you and Lasky accept responsibility?
LASKY: I've no time for a horticultural discussion now, young woman. You and your erratic friend have already disrupted my routine.
MEL: I only asked you if you'd tell what this leaf is.
LASKY: After my workout, and that's final.
DOLAND: I need to speak with you privately, Professor.
LASKY: Really! Not now, Doland!
DOLAND: I know how much you object to your work schedule being interrupted, but this is absolutely vital.
LASKY: Well?
DOLAND: You must speak with Bruchner, calm him down.
LASKY: Can't you?
DOLAND: Look, he won't listen to me.
LASKY: Where is he?
DOLAND: In the Hydroponic Centre.
MEL: Mister Doland.
MEL: Let's pick up where we left off while you're in the mood for explanations.
DOLAND: Did I give you that impression?
MEL: What are those pods in the Hydroponic Centre?
DOLAND: The results of another experiment.
MEL: I could have made an educated guess at that. What was in them?
DOLAND: Giant fruit. And anticipating your next question, we left the fruit on Mogar. We're merely taking the shucks as an example to fellow agronomists in earthbound laboratories. Now, if you'll excuse me.
MEL: Think, think.
MEL: Amplifier.
VERVOID : We must not make animal-kind aware of our existence. They still outnumber us. If we are to kill them all, we must hunt them down secretly.
DOCTOR: Is there anybody there, said the traveller. Perhaps she's in the gym.
DOCTOR: Ah, allow me. Wish I could get rid of my waste as easily, eh?
VERVOID : We must not make animal-kind aware of our existence.
VERVOID : We must hunt them down secretly. 
DOCTOR : Ah, allow me. Wish I could get rid of my waste as easily, eh?
DOCTOR: The waste bins, where do they go?
JANET: Waste bins?
DOCTOR: Quickly, woman. Where are they taken?
JANET: Well, the pulveriser, but why
DOCTOR: The pulveriser!
DOCTOR: Stop!
DOCTOR: Don't throw the towel in, Mel.
TRAVERS: Why in Hades haven't you reported before now? As a security officer, you're an unmitigated disaster.
RUDGE: That's hardly fair, sir.
TRAVERS: We've had a passenger murdered. According to you, another one's disappeared. Three crew members are missing, unaccounted for, and you haven't a clue as to why they've gone or where they are.
VERVOID: We are doing splendidly.
VERVOID 2: Congratulations must be delayed until that is full.
VERVOID: We shall not have long to wait.
DOCTOR: Doh! It's gone.
MEL: What has?
DOCTOR: The tape. The proof we need to force Lasky's hand.
MEL: It's a waste of time. Our killer's obviously removed it.
DOCTOR: Just as he tried to remove you.
MEL: He? Why not she?
DOCTOR: Lasky?
MEL: Or the stewardess, Janet.
DOCTOR: Janet? No.
MEL: It wouldn't have taken a man's strength to lift my weight. A woman could have dumped me in the waste bin.
DOCTOR: What are they, and how do they link with these murders?
MEL: Whatever they are, they're not human. And we're all to be destroyed, remember?
DOCTOR: Still got that bit of leaf?
MEL: Where are you off to?
DOCTOR: Hydroponic Centre. There has to be a connection.
MEL: And what about me?
DOCTOR: Follow your lead. See if Janet has got the tape. But Mel, be careful, hmm?
MEL: You too, Doctor.
JANET: Can I tempt you with a coffee, sir?
ATZA: No, thank you.
JANET: How about you, sir?
ORTEZO: Sorry.
JANET: Not to worry. It's easily changed.
DOCTOR: I didn't do that!
INQUISITOR: Stop the Matrix.
VALEYARD: Are we to be subjected to more chicanery, Sagacity?
DOCTOR: It wasn't me in there.
VALEYARD: Ridiculous. We all saw you. You're hardly mistakable in that outfit.
DOCTOR: I didn't smash the equipment!
INQUISITOR: Are you saying the communications equipment was not sabotaged?
DOCTOR: No, no, it had to be to prevent the Commodore getting information from Earth, but I didn't do it.
INQUISITOR: Then who did?
DOCTOR: The murderer.
VALEYARD: The murderer? I think, Inquisitor, the Doctor is telling us more than he realises.
DOCTOR: The prosecutor delights in scoring cheap victories, my lady. I swear to you, when I viewed that section earlier, I was nowhere near the Communications room.
VALEYARD: So once again the defendant is accusing the Matrix of being wrong.
INQUISITOR: Are you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes! Yes, I am.
INQUISITOR: If you are questioning its veracity, is there any point in continuing with the Matrix?
DOCTOR: But what else have I got? Without evidence to prove my innocence, I'm condemned.
VALEYARD: And with it you are also condemned, it seems, Doctor. Shall we continue?
INQUISITOR: Doctor? Shall we continue? You had, as before, sent your companion into danger.
LASKY: Sheer vandalism, and utterly useless.
BRUCHNER: Is that how you see it, Professor?
LASKY: How else?
BRUCHNER: Because I put an end to this obscene experiment?
LASKY: I should think that when man first discovered fire there were those who were equally appalled and wanted it suppressed.
LASKY: If they'd prevailed, the human race would still be cowering in caves.
BRUCHNER: To use your own phrase, that's all academic now.
LASKY: If you were rational, you'd realise how pointless this is. We can't unlearn knowledge. You're no illiterate. How often does a great advance produce this reaction. Think of Galileo.
BRUCHNER: Galileo? Oh, is that it? You see the name Lasky inscribed in the history books.
LASKY: Rubbish. This has been a team effort.
BRUCHNER: With you as leader. Well, you fulfil that role to the last. You've led me to see the fault in my strategy. You, me, Doland, even the creatures we've spawned, the sole representatives of this great advance, and we're all encapsulated on this ship. On this ship.
DOCTOR: I didn't even hear the dinner gong.
VERVOID 2: That man must be stopped. We are unique, the only members of the Vervoid species. If he succeeds in eliminating us, Vervoids will cease to exist.
VERVOID: Forget your previous orders. Bruchner's death is now our priority. He cannot be permitted to prevent us from reaching planet Earth.
LASKY: I don't care what you heard on some mythical tape.
DOCTOR: You're letting arrogance blinker you, Professor. It may not be your intention, but you are in danger of joining an extensive roll of dishonour. Misguided scientists who claim the pursuit of truth as an excuse for immoral experiments.
LASKY: This is no time to debate ethics. I made that mistake with Bruchner. I tell you the man's demented. He's out to destroy this ship and everyone on it.
DOCTOR: Yes, but
LASKY: First things first. Let's find Bruchner.
DOCTOR: But. He'll live.
BRUCHNER: Get out of here. Now! Or I'll kill both of you.
TRAVERS: Later. Get the laser lance up here immediately.
LASKY: Bruchner?
TRAVERS: Yes, but why? What's his motive?
DOCTOR: I rather think his intention is the vital question.
TRAVERS: All right then, what's?  Just tell me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: He's determined to destroy this ship.
LASKY: And the rest of us with it.
TRAVERS: Does the lunatic know anything about flying a spacecraft?
LASKY: Bruchner's been trained as an astronaut. One of the team had to be. Obligatory requirement.
TRAVERS: Very thorough.
DOCTOR: Can the power to the bridge be cut off?
TRAVERS: No, it's designed to be hijack proof.
LASKY: What's happening?
TRAVERS: Isn't that obvious? We're running into turbulence.
DOCTOR: I'd say rather more than turbulence.
LASKY: Don't talk in riddles, man.
DOCTOR: Your colleague is aiming the Hyperion Three into the eye of the Black Hole of Tartarus.
Part Twelve
VERVOID: Bruchner must be stopped. Get every Vervoid to the bridge area.
LASKY: How long before the ship reaches the point of no return, Commodore?
TRAVERS: That's a question no one has survived to answer. 
DOCTOR: Marsh gas?
LASKY: A methane derivative.
TRAVERS: Marsh gas? Where the devil's that come from? What is it you two know that I don't?
DOCTOR: Questions later. Will smoke masks be any good?
LASKY: No, they'd be completely inadequate.
TRAVERS: You're saying that none of us can go in there?
LASKY: It'd be suicide.
DOCTOR: Here, let me.
TRAVERS: It's my ship. If there's a risk to be taken, I'll take it.
DOCTOR: No!
RUDGE: There's no need for heroics from either of you.
RUDGE: Come to the bridge.
TRAVERS: If they make a hash of it in there, we're finished.
RUDGE: I doubt if that will happen, Commodore.
VALEYARD: The mortality rate that attends your meddling is appalling.
DOCTOR: You hold me responsible for Bruchner's death?
VALEYARD: Can you nominate a single incident where your presence has stemmed the tide of disaster?
INQUISITOR: Are you arguing that the submission for the defence should be curtailed?
VALEYARD: A verdict of guilty can be the only conclusion.
INQUISITOR: Sit down, Valeyard. In my court, I decide the verdict. Proceed, Doctor.
TRAVERS: I'm grateful to you both. Now that the air is breathable, I'll resume command.
RUDGE: I'm afraid that isn't going to be possible, Commodore.
ATZA: What he is stating, in the usually devious human manner, is that we are taking over the ship.
DOCTOR: A hijack? But you Mogarians are a peace-loving race. Violence is repugnant to you.
ATZA: No one will be harmed if they obey orders.
TRAVERS: Rudge, I will personally see to it that you rot in jail.
RUDGE: I should restrain that tongue of yours, Commodore. The Mogarians may not believe in violence, but I don't share their qualms. All my life, someone like you has been patronising me, treating me with contempt. Well, I'd welcome the opportunity of settling the score.
ATZA: Mister Rudge, take the hostages to the passenger lounge.
DOLAND: Surely you can contact the bridge now?
JANET: Still not responding, Mister Doland. I've just tried.
DOCTOR: Hold on, Rudge. If we are being hijacked, I think we deserve an explanation.
RUDGE: Any more unexpected moves, and it won't be an explanation you'll get.
MEL: We're being hijacked! If you don't want to get caught, come on! Quickly!
RUDGE: Oh no, Doctor. Over there, away from the door. Then you won't be tempted to try anything stupid. One moment, Commodore. I'll take the keys to the vault.
TRAVERS: The blazes you will.
RUDGE: Stay back. Professor Lasky, reach into the Commodore's pocket and take out the keys. Carefully.
DOCTOR: Now, what do you want in the vault?
RUDGE: For me, not a thing. The Mogarians are after the consignment of precious metals. Got this quaint notion it was plundered from their planet and they're just recovering stolen property.
DOCTOR: That can't be your motive.
LASKY: It's greed.
RUDGE: Not completely. Pride as well. After this voyage I was being written off as a has-been and put out to grass, so I decided to arrange a more comfortable retirement.
LASKY: If you've any decency left, you'll get this man some medical treatment.
RUDGE: There's a first aid kit in the cabinet.
DOCTOR: Rudge, this hijack is just a sideshow. There's a much greater menace.
RUDGE: Not my problem, Doctor. In less than an hour, we will rendezvous with our pickup.
DOCTOR: Here, let me. After all, I am a doctor.
LASKY: Rudge, you're nothing but a squalid criminal.
RUDGE: If I am, where does that place you, Professor?
ATZA : Pay attention. The Hyperion Three is no longer under the command of Commodore Travers. He is our prisoner, together with three other hostages. All personnel must remain at their posts. If there is any attempt to approach the lounge or the bridge, the hostages will be killed.
MEL: I'll put out a call for help.
MEL: Oh, great.
MEL: Millions of miles from anywhere and we're completely isolated.
DOLAND: Can you organise a squad of guards?
JANET: But you heard what the Mogarian said. They'll kill the hostages.
DOLAND: What makes you think they won't anyway. You're surely not naive enough to accept the word of a hijacker?
MEL: He's right, we can't just do nothing.
JANET: But if the guards go crashing in, they'll be signing four death warrants.
MEL: Not unless we can find a way of warning the hostages.
TRAVERS: You don't believe that Rudge is behind these killings, do you.
DOCTOR: No. No, he's just a weak man gone rogue.
TRAVERS: So, whatever the outcome of this hijack, we're still at the mercy of a murderer.
DOCTOR: Or murderers.
RUDGE : Have you got a sighting yet?
ATZA: No, but we are on schedule for our rendezvous. We should complete the mission as planned if your humans refrain from interference. What are you doing here?
ORTEZO: We did not request refreshment.
MEL: Doctor. The air duct.
DOCTOR: What are you doing in there? Don't you know how dangerous it is?
MEL: Shall I join you? There's going to be an attack on the lounge. When you hear the fire alarm, dive for cover.
DOCTOR: No.
MEL: What do you mean, no?
DOCTOR: Too risky. Attack the bridge.
MEL: The bridge?
DOCTOR: You heard. Now get out of that air duct, quickly.
MEL: Okay.
VERVOID 2: It is not only we who kill animal-kind. They kill each other.
VERVOID: They have no respect for any form of life. We shall resume the hunt.
DOLAND: Death must have been instantaneous. Oxygen's toxic to a Mogarian.
MEL: Yes, but how? I mean, who could have done this?
DOLAND: Forget playing the detective. Let's concentrate on the living. Rudge has to be convinced that the hijack's a lost cause, and that's going to take more than words.
MEL: Well, those face plates. They'll do the trick.
MEL : Mister Rudge, hold your fire. We're coming in.
JANET: The Mogarians are dead.
TRAVERS: Leave him to the guards. Get up on the bridge, now.
TRAVERS: Once I get this ship back on course, I'll want some answers from you, Professor. And that goes for you too, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I haven't been holding out on you, Commodore. There's a audiotape that'll explain everything.
TRAVERS: Then why haven't I heard it?
DOCTOR: Because it's been stolen. I would like carte blanche to search all the cabins.
TRAVERS: You've got it.
DOCTOR: Another request. I need a phaser.
MEL: A phaser? You?
DOCTOR: Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures.
MEL: I don't buy that. And why the public announcement about the tape? Everyone could hear.
DOCTOR: Could they?
MEL: I recognise that innocent tone. What's going on?
DOCTOR: Mel, I entered this affair as a Judas goat. I intend to re-adopt the role. Now, if Professor Lasky had the tape, where do you think she'd hide it?
MEL: Lasky?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
MEL: Her cabin, or her locker in the gym.
RUDGE: What are you?
DOLAND: If you're looking for a certain tape, Doctor, I don't think you'll find it in there.
DOCTOR: Does that mean you've hidden it somewhere else?
DOLAND: Obviously a denial isn't going to impress you. May I know of what I'm accused?
DOCTOR: Murder, amongst other things.
DOLAND: Murder? Am I supposed to treat this seriously?
DOCTOR: I have narrowed the suspects down to two. You and Professor Lasky.
DOLAND: Then I suggest you search the professor's cabin.
DOCTOR: I already have.
DOLAND: You really are serious.
DOCTOR: I'm never frivolous about murder.
DOLAND: So, this tape, it's important?
DOCTOR: Crucial.
DOLAND: I see. Well, I know I'm innocent, and I can't believe the professor's guilty, but if it'll end this nonsense, then, I know of another place where the professor keeps things.
LASKY: If you've finished with my tracksuit?
MEL: I was just admiring the er, the design.
LASKY: Don't bother to lie. You're not very good at it. No tape. That's what you were hoping to find, wasn't it?
DOLAND: I'm afraid the professor has the only key.
DOCTOR: And you're not going to object if I force it open?
DOLAND: Doctor. Your tape.
DOLAND: Not that it'll do you much good. I've wiped it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I rather thought you might have done.
DOLAND: You still suspected me, yet you came down here?
DOCTOR: A reckless streak. I'm prone to them. It wasn't difficult to pinpoint you. The first murder could only have been carried out by someone with access to this unit. The second needed poison. Even the abortive attempt on Mel's life could only have been committed by someone who could go unchallenged into the Isolation Room and get the anaesthetic.
DOLAND: All this could have applied to Lasky.
DOCTOR: No, not the Mogarians. She was a hostage when they were slaughtered.
DOLAND: And my motive?
DOCTOR: Could be jealousy, professional envy. I'd say it was the more commonplace avarice.
DOLAND: Then you're not as astute as I thought, Doctor. Those creatures, we call them Vervoids, represent vast economic power.
DOCTOR: Provided you can get them back to Earth.
DOLAND: Oh, but I shall, no matter what the cost. Then robots can be dumped on the scrap heap. Vervoids will run the factories and farms at practically no cost. All they need is sunlight and water.
DOCTOR: I take it you have someone willing to finance this exploitation?
DOLAND: A consortium with the vision to recognise the potential of the Vervoids.
DOCTOR: Vision? You're talking about slave labour.
DOLAND: The most enduring and spectacular empire, Rome, was built on slave labour.
DOCTOR: Came to a pretty unpleasant end, though.
DOLAND: Which brings us neatly to you.
DOCTOR: I took the precaution of disarming it.
DOCTOR: I also took the precaution of taking the Commodore into my confidence.
TRAVERS: Throw him in the brig.
VERVOID: Doland will soon be joining them.
DOLAND: No, no. I'm not your enemy. Without me, you wouldn't exist. I'm your friend.
TRAVERS: You created these psychopaths. Now tell me how to get rid of them.
DOCTOR: The Vervoids are not psychopaths.
MEL: Doctor, I heard them say they intended to wipe us out.
LASKY: Something must have gone wrong, radically wrong. A malfunction of the DNA.
DOCTOR: Why is it none of you can see what's so glaringly obvious?
TRAVERS: Maybe we lack your divine insight.
DOCTOR: No divine insight, just logic.
MEL: Logic?
DOCTOR: When you overheard the Vervoids, Mel, how did they describe us?
MEL: Er, wait a second. Animal-kind.
DOCTOR: Not human beings, not Mogarians, animal-kind.
TRAVERS: I hope this is relevant.
LASKY: It is. He's making sense. The Vervoids are plants.
DOCTOR: At some stage, directly or indirectly, all animal-kind consumes plant life. Without it, we'd perish.
LASKY: I must have been blinded by professional vanity. Bruchner saw it. I should have, too.
MEL: Doctor, if you're right, then coexistence with the Vervoids is an impossibility.
TRAVERS: It's a question of self-preservation. Kill or be killed.
DOCTOR: A conflict in which there can be no justice.
TRAVERS: Equally, there's no choice, and that goes for you too, Doctor. We need your undivided commitment.
DOCTOR: And there you have it. The direct request. I did not meddle. I was presented with an appeal, and not just from anybody, but from the man in whom authority was vested.
INQUISITOR: I accept your argument. Nor, Valeyard, can you refute it.
VALEYARD: Perhaps we should await the outcome of this adventure, my lady.
INQUISITOR: Doctor, do you wish to continue?
DOCTOR: Providing we can trust the Matrix, my lady. And I won't know that until I see it.
LASKY: There's not enough left to make up a spoonful of herbicide. The Vervoids must have got here first.
MEL: Any more ideas, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Why can't I rid myself of the feeling we're approaching this the wrong way round? Professor, do Vervoid chloroplasts function normally?
LASKY: A cytogeneticist now? You're a man of varied talents.
DOCTOR: Don't prevaricate, Professor.
LASKY: Yes, Vervoid chloroplasts trap sunlight as is normal with all plants.
MEL: Doctor, there's something out there.
DOCTOR: Is there another exit?
LASKY: Not this side of the hold. I'm going to talk to them.
DOCTOR: They won't listen.
LASKY: Perhaps they will, to me. I wasn't going to exploit them like Doland. They'll know that.
DOCTOR: They'll spare no one.
LASKY: I have to try.
MEL: Doctor!
LASKY: You must know who I am.
VERVOID: Yes, Professor Lasky, we do.
LASKY: Then you must also be aware that I mean you no harm.
VERVOID: All animal-kind is our enemy, Professor. Even you.
MEL: How could they? It's obscene.
DOCTOR: Not to a Vervoid.
MEL: You can't justify it. It's just
DOCTOR: It's a matter of perspective, Mel. In your house in Pease Pottage, you had a large garden. What did you do with the plants and weeds you uprooted?
MEL: Put them on a compost heap.
DOCTOR: They're obeying instinct, like migrating birds or salmon swimming relentlessly upstream to spawn even though they may die. A compulsive following of the life cycle. Come on, Mel.
JANET: It's useless, Commodore.
JANET : They're everywhere!
DOCTOR: We need your help, Commodore.
TRAVERS: Name it.
DOCTOR: Like the Vervoids, we're being driven by blind instinct. Kill or be killed.
TRAVERS: We've been over that.
DOCTOR: What if instead of bringing their lives to an abrupt end we did the opposite, accelerated the Vervoid life cycle?
TRAVERS: How the blazes do we do that?
DOCTOR: Vionesium.
MEL: Vionesium?
DOCTOR: A rare metal found on the airless planet of Mogar.
TRAVERS: And worth a prince's ransom.
DOCTOR: Or a hijack.
MEL: You mean there's a consignment on board?
TRAVERS: That's right, in the vault.
MEL: But how will this vionesium accelerate the Vervoid life cycle?
DOCTOR: It's a substance similar to magnesium. Exposed to oxygenated air, it releases incredibly intense light and carbon dioxide. Spring, summer, autumn, all condensed into a few moments.
TRAVERS: Seasons which I may be a long time enjoying again if I go robbing my own vault.
MEL: Seasons you can forget if you don't. We've seen what these creatures can do.
DOCTOR: You've no alternative, Commodore.
MEL: You can't send for outside help, the ship's completely cut off. The Doctor's the only hope you've got.
TRAVERS: All right, Doctor, you can have the vionesium. What's the drill?
DOCTOR: First, you must drive the Vervoids back to their lair.
TRAVERS: Me?
DOCTOR: Plunge the ship into darkness.
JANET: They're never going to give up!
TRAVERS: Attention all passengers and crew. A major fault has developed in the generators.
 
TRAVERS : To effect necessary repairs, the heating will be shut down and auxiliary lighting only will be in operation.
VERVOID: Are all the Vervoids here?
VERVOID 2: There is still another to come.
VERVOID: This power fault could be a trick.
VERVOID 2: What can they gain? Animal-kind need the life support system. They must repair the generator to survive.
MEL: No!
DOCTOR: The vionesium, Mel!
DOCTOR: You can restore power. It's over.
TRAVERS: Restore power.
JANET: Till we meet again, Mel.
MEL: Yes.
JANET: Doctor.
TRAVERS: No, don't say that. I owe you my thanks, Doctor, but let's make this the sweet sorrow of a final parting, hmm?
MEL: I shall remember that the next time we get a mayday call.
DOCTOR: She means that, too. Memory like an elephant.
MEL: That's his idea of a compliment, comparing me to an elephant.
DOCTOR: But so ludicrously appropriate, I find it amusing.
MEL: Well, at least if you're laughing you can't be singing. Have you ever heard his rendering of On With The Motley? Count your blessings. Bye.
DOCTOR : Vesti la guibba e la faccia
INQUISITOR: Did none of the unfortunate creatures survive, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, my lady. Had even a leaf survived and fallen on fertile soil, a Vervoid would have grown.
VALEYARD: Every Vervoid was destroyed by your ingenious plan.
DOCTOR: Yes.
VALEYARD: Whether or not the Doctor has proved himself innocent of meddling is no longer the cardinal issue before this court. He has proved himself guilty of a far greater crime.
INQUISITOR: You refer to Article seven of Gallifreyan law?
DOCTOR: No, my lady, that cannot apply! Had a single Vervoid reached Earth, the human race would have been eliminated!
VALEYARD: Article seven permits no exceptions. The Doctor has destroyed a complete species. The charge must now be genocide.
