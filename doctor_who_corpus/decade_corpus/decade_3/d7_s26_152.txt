Battlefield
Part One
DORIS: Alastair, Alastair?
BRIGADIER: Mmm?
DORIS: What about this one?
BRIGADIER: Oh fine, if you like it, Doris.
DORIS: Oh, show some enthusiasm. It'd look great by one of our azalea beds. What do you think?
BRIGADIER: Yes. I'll plant it when we get home.
DORIS: Oh, thank you.
BRIGADIER: The exercise will do me good. Now, where's that salesman got to? Typical lack of efficiency.
DORIS: Back in your soldier days you just had to give an order and stand back.
BRIGADIER: Of course. Sergeant Benton, tree planting party, at the double!
DORIS: Sir! You don't regret it, do you?
BRIGADIER: What, giving up teaching?
DORIS: No, leaving United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.
BRIGADIER: No, my blood and thunder days are long past.
A Range Rover and a truck stop on a track overlooking the lake. They are UNIT vehicles. The Eastern European sergeant driver of the Range Rover uses the field telephone.)
ZBRIGNIEV: Come in, Salamander six zero. Over.
ZBRIGNIEV: Come in Salamander six zero. Over.
RICHARDS  :Salamander six zero reading you strength one. Over.
ZBRIGNIEV: Stand by, six zero. Brigadier, I've made contact with Lieutenant Richards. Six zero, the Brigadier is coming now.
BAMBERA: Salamander six zero, please clarify your situation. Over.
RICHARDS : Massive electrical disturbance. Over.
BAMBERA: Salamander six zero, you're breaking up. Over.  Salamander, do you copy?
BAMBERA: Get that vehicle on the road ASAP.
ZBRIGNIEV: They've gone.
BAMBERA: Must be the storm.
ZBRIGNIEV: I don't like this weather.
MORGAINE : At last, he is revealed to us.
ACE: Professor, why is it dark in here?
DOCTOR: Quiet, Ace. I'm working.
ACE: Oh, is that why it's dark?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: What's that noise?
DOCTOR: A cry in the dark.
ACE: A distress signal?
DOCTOR: A cry for help. Perhaps a summoning.
ACE: Where's it coming from?
DOCTOR: Earth. Rippling out through the cosmos, forward in time, backwards in time and sideways in time.
ACE: Sideways in time?
DOCTOR: Yes, sideways in time, across the boundaries that divide one universe from another.
ACE: Weird. This cry, who's it for?
DOCTOR: For? I don't know.
ACE: Perhaps if we went there? Where's it coming from again?
DOCTOR: Earth. A few years in your future.
ACE: It's giving me the creeps. What does it mean?
DOCTOR: We'll know in a moment, once we've deciphered it.
VOICE : Merlin. Merlin.
ACE: Wherever it is it's coming from, I don't think we want to go there.
DOCTOR: Too late. We've already arrived.
BAMBERA: Salamander six zero, this is Seabird one. Are you receiving me? Over.
ZBRIGNIEV: Brigadier.
BAMBERA: What now?
ZBRIGNIEV: Hitchhikers.
BAMBERA: Oh, shame.
ACE: Don't stop, then! I don't care!
DOCTOR: I don't think this'll stop either.
ACE: Don't be such a pessimist, Professor.
WARMSLY: Where are you heading?
DOCTOR: North east.
WARMSLY: Right, climb aboard. Come to see the dig, have you?
DOCTOR: Ah, archaeological dig?
WARMSLY: Yes, actually. Oh, sorry, Haven't introduced myself. I'm Peter Warmsly. I'm site manager for the Carbury Trust Conservation Area.
ACE: I'm Ace, and this is the Doctor. 
WARMSLY: The dig, as a matter of fact, is a hobby. A battlefield.
ACE: What battlefield?
PETER: I hate that sound, don't you. Sometimes at night I lie there listening, thinking it might be
DOCTOR: The beginning of something terrible.
ACE: What was that?
PETER: The military use the area as a firing range. Never understood why.
DOCTOR: Blowing the occasional chunk out of the earth keeps them amused.
ACE: It didn't sound like a shell.
BAMBERA: Oh, very good. Why not drive the missile into the lake?
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Yes. The transmission's definitely coming from over there.
ACE: Professor.
ACE: It's a missile convoy.
DOCTOR: A nuclear missile convoy.
ACE: How do you know?
DOCTOR: It has a graveyard stench.
WARMSLY: Warmsly's the name and I demand to see to somebody in charge.
BAMBERA: What was that?
ZBRIGNIEV: Low flying jet?
BAMBERA: Not this far south. Raise Division. Get them to check flight paths.
ZBRIGNIEV: I'm sorry sir but we cannot get a signal out.
BAMBERA: Well, see what you can do, Zbrigniev. All this noise is making me nervous.
SOLDIER: There's a Mister Warmsly who wants to speak to an officer.
ZBRIGNIEV: Brigadier! There's a Mister Warmsly who wants to speak to somebody in charge.
BAMBERA: You talk to him, Zbrigniev. I've got enough troubles.
ACE: Didn't sound like a shell. More like a couple of rockets.
DOCTOR: Close.
DOCTOR: What we need is something to help us.
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Ah yes, of course! I never thought I'd need these again.
DOCTOR: This should remove a few obstacles.
ACE: Who's Elizabeth Shaw? I don't even look like her.
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Just think like a physicist.
DOCTOR: Now, what seems to be the problem?
BAMBERA: Excuse me?
DOCTOR: Well, you've had an explosion in your electronics, haven't you?
ACE: An electro-magnetic pulse effect.
BAMBERA: Make yourself at home.
DOCTOR: Caused by?
ACE: A nuclear explosion, usually.
BAMBERA: I think I would have noticed a nuclear explosion.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, they are conspicuous.
ACE: Well, if there was no nuke, where did the energy pulse come from?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
BAMBERA: All systems failures were the result of a minor technical difficulty.
BAMBERA: I don't know where you got these from, but I intend to find out. Show these two out.
DOCTOR: I'd just like to say three things.
BAMBERA: What?
DOCTOR: Yeti, Autons, Daleks. Cybermen and Silurians!
ACE: That was five things.
DOCTOR: She didn't even notice. Among all the varied wonders of the universe there's nothing so firmly clamped shut as the military mind.
BAMBERA: Well done, Zbrigniev. Two civilians waltz up with a pair of antiquated pass cards and you let them in. Why?
ZBRIGNIEV: Sir.
BAMBERA: You know something. What is it?
ZBRIGNIEV: Off the record, sir.
BAMBERA: Off the record.
ZBRIGNIEV: When I served under Lethbridge Stewart, we had a scientific advisor called the Doctor.
BAMBERA: The man outside.
ZBRIGNIEV: No, sir, but
BAMBERA: But?
ZBRIGNIEV: He changed his appearance, several times.
BAMBERA: A disguise.
ZBRIGNIEV: No, sir. The word was he changed his whole physical appearance.
BAMBERA: His whole appearance.
ZBRIGNIEV: And his personality.
BAMBERA: How could he be the same man if his appearance and personality have changed?
ZBRIGNIEV: I don't know, sir.
BAMBERA: What do you know, Zbrigniev?
ZBRIGNIEV: Just that whenever this Doctor turns up
BAMBERA: Yes?
ZBRIGNIEV: All hell breaks loose.
DORIS: Alistair! Telephone for you.
BRIGADIER: Who is it?
DORIS: Hello, can you tell me who's speaking? Okay, fine. thank you. Geneva!
BRIGADIER: Oh, probably just another peace conference. Tell them I've retired. Tell them I'd decided to fade away.
DORIS: No, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid he's unavailable. Okay, yes, I will. Thank you. Bye, bye. Alistair, that was the Secretary General.
BRIGADIER: Doris, I don't care if it was the King. I'm still retired.
DORIS: He said something about the Doctor being back. Alistair, who is the Doctor?
BRIGADIER: I wonder how high it will get?
DOCTOR: We could have walked to the hotel, you know.
BAMBERA: No problem. I thought you'd like to see Vortigern's Lake.
DOCTOR: Vortigern. That's an interesting name.
ACE: Yeah, fascinating.
DOCTOR: What's your name, by the way?
BAMBERA: Brigadier Winifred Bambera.
ACE: Winifred?
DOCTOR: There are many secrets in names. Vortigern is old British for High King.
ACE: Your convoy's stranded by the lake of the High King.
PAT: Can I help you?
DOCTOR: Yes. I'd like to book a room. One for myself and one for my young friend here.
PAT: Yes, sir. Long journey?
DOCTOR: Er, quite a distance, as it happens.
PAT: Then you'll be having a drink, sir. 
ACE: Yes, please.
DOCTOR: Why not. What do you have?
PAT: What we have, sir, is possibly the finest beer in the area, even if I do say so myself. Perhaps the best in the country.
DOCTOR: Really?
SHOU: He makes it himself in a converted barn at the end of the garden.
PAT: It's in the CAMRA guide. We call it Arthur's Ale.
SHOU: Vodka and coke, Pat.
DOCTOR: Glass of water, please. Ace?
ACE: Oh, vodka and
DOCTOR: Ace?
ACE: Lemonade, please.
SHOU: Good choice.
ACE: Lemonade?
SHOU: Anything but the beer.
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm The Doctor, and this is my friend
SHOU: Ace.
PAT: There we are, sir. Five pounds, please.
ACE: How much?
DOCTOR: Remember, we are in the future.
DOCTOR: There, a five pound piece.
PAT: Thank you, sir.
DOCTOR: Do you mind? It's a very valuable piece of coinage.
SOLDIER : Assume maximum alert. If the Doctor is involved, look out for a police telephone box.
BAMBERA: Look out for what?
BAMBERA: Oh, shame.
SHOU: So you've met Peter?
DOCTOR: Mmm. Very knowledgeable fellow.
SHOU: Hmm, it's one way of putting it. He's got this thing about King Arthur. Digs things up out of the ground by the lake.
DOCTOR: Well, he is an archaeologist.
SHOU: Can't see it myself, all that patient scraping about. You know, I get the urge to bung half a kilo of TNT down the hole and bring it all up in one go.
ACE: Now you're talking!
DOCTOR: The point of archaeology is to carefully recover the past, not disintegrate it.
SHOU: Wouldn't make much difference. The only half decent thing Peter's ever found is that scabbard.
ACE: You could use something with more brisance.
SHOU: More brisance? Than trinitrotoluene? Like what?
DOCTOR: How remarkable.
ACE: Tell you outside.
SHOU: Why outside?
ACE: He gets upset when I talk about explosives.
ELIZABETH: Interesting, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ELIZABETH: I wish I could see what it looks like. I can feel its presence sometimes. Touch it.
DOCTOR: My, it's hot. No, no. Now it's cold.
ELIZABETH: Every so often I get the strangest feeling about it.
DOCTOR: What kind of feeling?
ELIZABETH: Oh, that it's waiting for something. Stupid, really.
DOCTOR: Waiting for something, or someone.
BAMBERA: Oh, shame.
BRIGADIER: I'm surprised it still fits.
DORIS: I should have thrown it out while I had the chance.
DORIS: And that, too. You could have said no.
BRIGADIER: I could have, Doris, but I still have my duty.
DORIS: This isn't duty. You want to go. I mean, do I? All this means so little to you.
BRIGADIER: I will be coming back.
DORIS: You don't need to go. You don't need to go on playing soldier any more.
BRIGADIER: I'm not playing.
MORGAINE : There is the enemy. Kill him.
WARMSLY: Elizabeth! Ah, I need to use your telephone. The one in my car isn't working.
WARMSLY: Yes. Call. External. Sedgewick. Carbury Trust.
DOCTOR: Mister Warmsly, just the person.
WARMSLY: There's a convoy just off the road by the lake with a nuclear missile in.
TELEPHONE: There is a fault on the line. There is a fault
WARMSLY: Yes. Off.
DOCTOR: This scabbard.
WARMSLY: The line's dead.
DOCTOR: This scabbard. Where did you find it?
WARMSLY: Here, locally. Why?
DOCTOR: Where?
WARMSLY: For the scabbard's worth
BOTH: Ten of the sword.
WARMSLY: Said Merlin. Yeah. Hey, careful with it. It was found here, at the dig by the lake.
DOCTOR: What period?
WARMSLY: Does it matter? Eighth century AD.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's been waiting around longer than that.
WARMSLY: Waiting for what?
MORGAINE : Waiting for me!
DORIS: Alistair, I found this. You'd forgotten it.
BRIGADIER: Oh, thank you.
DORIS: You will be careful.
BRIGADIER: Of course. I've always been careful. Don't worry. I'll sort all this out and then come home.
DORIS: Okay. They're waiting for you.
ACE: Well, it was obvious I was never going to be the world's greatest artist. Anyway, Mrs Parkinson the art teacher asked me what it is, right, so I told her it was a lump of school plasticine. Well, I couldn't tell her what it really was.
SHOU: The home made gelignite.
ACE: So, we're in the school corridor by now and Mrs Parkinson asks me to put what she thinks is school plasticine back in the art room.
SHOU: So what did you do?
ACE: I tossed it over my shoulder, like that.
ACE: Landed right in the middle of class one C's prize winning pottery pig collection.
ACE: And boom!
SHOU: Boom?
ACE: Boom!
SHOU: It's hit the brewery!
ACE: We'd better get the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good idea. Did you see it?
ACE: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And?
ACE: It looked like a bloke.
DOCTOR: A bloke, flying through the air?
SHOU: And then through a wall.
DOCTOR: You two, stay here.
ACE: Be serious, Professor.
SHOU: What's going on?
ACE: You'd better ask the Professor.
SHOU: What's going on?
DOCTOR: Shush.
ACE: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ACE: I can't see anything.
SHOU: What was that?
ACE: Is it an android?
DOCTOR: No, it's a human.
ANCELYN: Merlin. Against all hope.
SHOU: Merlin?
ACE: You've got it wrong, mate. This is the Doctor.
ANCELYN: Oh, he has many faces, but in my reckoning, he is Merlin.
DOCTOR: You recognise my face, then?
ANCELYN: No, not your aspect, but your manner that betrays you. Do you not ride the ship of time? Does it not deceive the senses being larger within than out? Merlin, cease these games and tell me truly, is this the time?
DOCTOR: Time for what?
ANCELYN: Thou dost not know? Truly?
ACE: Do you think he'd be asking if he did, tin head?
ANCELYN: Why, the answer to Excalibur's call. The time of restitution. The time when Arthur rises to lead the Britons to war.
DOCTOR: Vortigern's Lake, of course. Can you walk?
SHOU: Can someone answer a simple question?
ACE: What's wrong, Doctor?
SHOU: Can someone tell me what on Earth is going on?
DOCTOR: Well, if my hunch is right, the Earth could be at the centre of a war that doesn't even belong to this dimension.
BAMBERA: Freeze! Everyone stand nice and easy.
DOCTOR: Listen, Winifred. We've got to be somewhere urgently, so please get out of the way.
BAMBERA: You're all under arrest. You and your freaky friends.
ACE: Who are you calling freaky?
DOCTOR: I can sort this out. Look, if I can just explain.
MORDRED: Kill them! Kill them now.
Part Two
BAMBERA: I'm an armed military officer. You are under arrest. Lay your weapons down and put your hands in the air.
DOCTOR: Winifred, this is not the way.
BAMBERA: Put the guns down!
DOCTOR: Listen, now that we're all here, let me introduce myself. I am the Doctor and this is
ANCELYN: Mordred.
MORDRED: Ancelyn. Fitting that you should die amongst peasants.
ANCELYN: Look again, Mordred.
DOCTOR: Do you recognise me?
MORDRED: Merlin!
ACE: Not again.
MORDRED: You were bound. My mother sealed you into the ice caves for all eternity.
DOCTOR: I am the master of time. I cannot be bound so easily.
MORDRED: Master of lies.
ANCELYN: Beware your tongue, Mordred. Have you so easily forgotten Baden, hmm? The way he cast down your mother with his mighty arts.
DOCTOR: Yes, remember Baden and my mighty arts. Do you think I would use mere trickery against someone as formidable as you? Go, before I unleash a terrible something on you.
ANCELYN: Go, Mordred, while you still live.
MORDRED: There will be a reckoning, Ancelyn. I have sworn it. As for you, Merlin, my mother has waited twelve centuries to face you. You will bow down before her this time.
ACE: Who was he?
DOCTOR: That was Mordred, and his mother is Morgaine, a mighty sorceress.
SHOU: You know these guys then?
DOCTOR: Never met them before.
LAVEL: ATC Docklands, this Uniform November niner zero. Request clearance for London Central. Over. Thank you, Docklands. Over. We are clear all the way to London, sir.
BRIGADIER: Right, I want an exclusion zone around the whole of the Carbury area, extending for one mile. One and a half kilometres outside the limit of radio jamming.
LAVEL: I'm sorry, sir, but the bulk of the European UNIT commitment is handling the Azanian ceasefire.
BRIGADIER: Well, who's left?
LAVEL: The Czech engineering group. Flood relief in the low countries. They can be at the site by tomorrow.
BRIGADIER: Put it into motion.
LAVEL: Sir.
BRIGADIER: Oh, and Lavel?
LAVEL: Sir?
BRIGADIER: The officer who requested the information on the Doctor, this Brigadier Bambera. Good man, is he?
DOCTOR: Brigadier Bambera, if we're going to work together, you've got to stop shooting at everything that moves.
BAMBERA: Not you. I want to talk to you.
ANCELYN: I am Ancelyn ap Gwalchmai, Knight General of the Britons. I do not talk to peasants.
BAMBERA: You'll talk to me.
ACE: Professor!
DOCTOR: Oh, ignore them. They're just establishing their credentials.
ACE: They've got a funny way of doing it.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about them.
SHOU: What should we worry about?
DOCTOR: Sorcery.
MORDRED: Here is the convocation. This we make the meeting place. The point between two worlds.
MORDRED: Two universes. Two realities.
DOCTOR: No one's to go outside.
ELIZABETH: I heard gunshots earlier.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PAT: Why not?
DOCTOR: There are things out there in the dark you wouldn't want to meet.
WARMSLY: What was that?
BAMBERA: Come on, move it, will you. Get in. Brigadier Bambera.
DOCTOR: What happened to you?
ANCELYN: She vanquished me, and I threw myself on her mercy.
BAMBERA: As of now, I'm in charge. Everyone remain calm. We'll soon have everything under control.
DOCTOR: I doubt that.
MORDRED: By this sword, brother to Excalibur, I part the curtain of night.
WARMSLY: What's that noise?
PAT: What noise?
WARMSLY: That noise!
DOCTOR: Which way does that wall face?
WARMSLY: Excuse me, but three inches to the left
PAT: North, towards the lake.
ATC : Docklands ATC to Uniform November niner zero. Clear for final approach. Over.
LAVEL: Roger, Docklands ATC. Commencing approach now. We'll be landing in London shortly, sir.
MORDRED: Across the abyss, life calls to life, biomass to biomass, energy to energy. To Avallion I summon thee from beyond the confines of this universe.
BAMBERA: Another storm. Just what we need.
DOCTOR: Stay where you are.
WARMSLY: An earthquake?
SHOU: Doctor!
BAMBERA: What's going on, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I've got some nasty suspicions.
 
SHOU: An earthquake? In England?
DOCTOR: No. Someone is creating a rip in the fabric of time and space.
ANCELYN: She is coming.
BAMBERA: What are you talking about? Who's coming?
ACE: You can feel it?
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm uniquely sensitive. Argh! Gah!
ACE: Doctor! What is it?
MORDRED: Immortal Morgaine, ageless and deathless.
MORGAINE: Mordred.
MORDRED: Mother, Merlin is here.
MORGAINE: Yes, I can feel his presence.
MORDRED: He has a new countenance.
MORGAINE: He has worn many faces. Merlin, hear me.
DOCTOR:  I hear you.
MORGAINE: Do not stand against me this time, for your soul's sake.
DOCTOR: I cannot allow your interference.
MORGAINE: Then, Merlin, let this be our last battlefield.
DOCTOR: Good morning.
LAVEL: How did it go, sir?
BRIGADIER: Oh, usual bureaucracy. Inch thick forms and half a pint of blood.
LAVEL: That's London for you.
BRIGADIER: Funny how it looks beautiful at sunrise.
LAVEL: Never noticed. Seen one heliport and you've seen them all. Where now, sir?
BRIGADIER: Carbury, where the action is.
DOCTOR: And you excavated all this yourself?
WARMSLY: Labour of love, really.
DOCTOR: Impressive.
WARMSLY: And I did have some help from Shou Yuing.
DOCTOR: And where did you find the scabbard?
WARMSLY: By that marker.
ACE: How long did it take?
WARMSLY: Oh, about ten years so far.
ACE: Ten years?
WARMSLY: Archeology is a precise and delicate skill. History has to be eased out of the earth one painstaking layer at a time.
ACE: I still think ten years is a bit of a long time.
ACE: What's this?
WARMSLY: Ah, now that's a bit of a mystery. No one's been able to decipher the carving.
DOCTOR: It says, Dig Hole Here.
WARMSLY: Extraordinary. What does it say that in?
DOCTOR: My handwriting. Ace, we need a hole.
ACE: Right. How long?
DOCTOR: Er, sixty seconds should be long enough.
WARMSLY: Long enough for what?
DOCTOR: Nothing to worry about. My young friend's something of an expert.
WARMSLY: What, in archeology?
DOCTOR: No, explosives.
WARMSLY: What?
DOCTOR: Down!
DOCTOR: Ace?
ACE: I think the timer needs work.
DOCTOR: One of these days we're going to have a nice long talk about acceptable safety standards.
BRIGADIER: Has Major Husak reported in yet?
LAVEL: No, sir. London says that the area of radio interference is expanding.
BRIGADIER: Well, see if you can raise him from here. Can you speak Czechoslovakian?
LAVEL: Only when I'm drunk, sir.
BAMBERA: He'd better not be gone when we get there.
ANCELYN: You cannot hold the Doctor. He goes where he will.
BAMBERA: Shut up and run, Ancelyn.
ANCELYN: My lady.
BAMBERA: You call me my lady once more and I'll break your nose.
LAVEL: I can't see anybody around.
BRIGADIER: Looks like some damage to that barn.
LAVEL: I can see a possible landing zone. Everything looks peaceful.
BRIGADIER: Yes, very peaceful. Are you armed, Lieutenant?
LAVEL: Yes, sir.
BRIGADIER: Well, check it's loaded and take us in.
MORGAINE: What can you see?
MORDRED: A flying machine. Tis like an ornithopter but with whirling blades for wings.
MORGAINE: The people of this world are obsessed with machinery.
MORDRED: It would seem so.
MORGAINE: Well then, let us teach them the limitations of their technologies.
LAVEL: Malfunction, sir.
BRIGADIER: What?
LAVEL: It felt like something hit us. This could be rough.
ACE: What's down there?
WARMSLY: Don't ask me. I've only been excavating this site for ten years.
DOCTOR: With a bit of luck, a tunnel.
ACE: A dark, mysterious one?
DOCTOR: Probably.
ACE: Leading to unknown dangers?
DOCTOR: Indubitably.
ACE: Oh, wicked!
DOCTOR: Peter, Ace and I are going to investigate this tunnel. You stay here and guard it. Don't let anyone come in here.
WARMSLY: What am I supposed to do, lecture them on archeology?
DOCTOR: Yes.
BRIGADIER: Can you get us down?
LAVEL: Down is not the problem.
ACE: It's damp.
DOCTOR: Well, we are under the lake.
ACE: And this wall's made of concrete.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's gone soft with age. This was built in the eighth century.
ACE: But they didn't have concrete in those days.
DOCTOR: No, they didn't.
ACE: Thought so.
ACE: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Ace. It's only a trap.
BRIGADIER: Five million pounds worth of aircraft, and we've lost it.
LAVEL: If they make us pay for that
BRIGADIER: We'll be poor for the rest of our lives.
BRIGADIER: Pulled a ligament?
LAVEL: Oh good. I thought it might be something serious.
BRIGADIER: I'll see if I can get some help from the village.
LAVEL: But sir, we don't know what the situation is here.
BRIGADIER: The situation, Lavel, is normal. It doesn't get much worse than that. You know, I think I'm rather enjoying this.
MORDRED: Tis a shrine to those fallen in battle.
MORGAINE: So, they are not the savages you led us to believe. You fought on their soil without proper respect for the dead.
MORDRED: Mother, I
MORGAINE: You have dishonoured us, Mordred. What is victory without honour? Leave us!
MORGAINE: What manner of man are you?
MORGAINE: A warrior, no less. How goes the day?
BRIGADIER: I've had better.
MORGAINE: I am Morgaine, the sun killer. Dominator of the thirteen worlds and Battle Queen of the S'Rax. What say you?
BRIGADIER: I am Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. Surrender now, and we can avoid bloodshed.
BAMBERA: Where's the Doctor?
WARMSLY: Did you know that it takes one year to uncover one centimetre on a site this big? But now, delay not. Take the sword and fling him far into the middle mere. Watch what thou seest and lightly bring me word.
DOCTOR: Ancelyn's people must have built this tunnel.
ACE: Looks fishy to me.
DOCTOR: This is no place for humour.
ACE: Professor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ACE: Where does Ancelyn come from?
DOCTOR: Another dimension. Sideways in time from another universe.
ACE: Not a local boy, then.
DOCTOR: The question is, how do we get through here?
BRIGADIER: Let me see if I've understood you correctly. You are holding a Remembrance ceremony for the dead of our World Wars, a ceasefire to remain in force for the duration of said ceremony, right?
MORGAINE: Your words are strange, but that is the meaning, yes.
BRIGADIER: Right. What must I do?
ACE: No coded pattern?
DOCTOR: No hidden switches.
ACE: Well, how are we going to get through the door, then?
DOCTOR: Open up. It's me.
MORGAINE: I wish you to know that I bear you no malice.
BRIGADIER: I understand.
MORGAINE: But when we meet again, I shall kill you.
ACE: I refuse to ask how you did that. How did you do that?
DOCTOR: Well, it came to me that it wasn't Ancelyn's people who built this tunnel. It was Merlin.
ACE: But everyone thinks that you're Merlin.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Door keyed to my voice pattern. Just the sort of thing I would do.
ACE: Are you Merlin?
DOCTOR: No. But I could be, in the future. That is, my personal future. Which could be the past.
ACE: Right.
BRIGADIER: I'm commandeering this car, miss.
SHOU: Sorry?
BRIGADIER: The keys, please
SHOU: What?
BRIGADIER: The keys. Thank you.
SHOU: Hey, just a moment. This is my car.
ACE: This is a spaceship?
DOCTOR: More than that. It's a craft for travelling between dimensions.
ACE: It's more like being in some huge animal. Who built it?
DOCTOR: It wasn't built, it was grown.
ACE: Who grows spaceships?
DOCTOR: Very advanced bioengineers.
ACE: Ask a stupid question. Well, if they're grown, how do they fly?
DOCTOR: Magic.
ACE: Oh, be feasible, Professor.
DOCTOR: What is Clarke's law?
ACE: Any advanced form of technology is indistinguishable from magic.
DOCTOR: Well, the reverse is true.
ACE: Any advanced form of magic is indistinguishable?
ACE: From technology.
ACE: Seen one spaceship you've seen them all.
DOCTOR: Don't be so cynical, Ace.
ACE: Wow.
DOCTOR: Impressive.
ACE: That's Arthur, King of the Britons, isn't it?
DOCTOR: The legendary Arthur, yes. From another dimension, where the man was closer to the myth. But what is he doing here?
ACE: Not a lot. Is he in suspended animation?
DOCTOR: Who knows?
ACE: In eternal sleep until England's greatest need.
DOCTOR: Ace, don't touch that.
ACE: Oh, it's all right, Professor. It's not like I'm King of the Britons, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ace!
ACE: Gordon Bennett!
DOCTOR: I hope you haven't disturbed anything.
ACE: It disturbed me.
DOCTOR: Well, I only hope you haven't disturbed anything else!
ACE: Like what?
DOCTOR: Like that. Look!
ACE: Where?
DOCTOR: I think I saw something over there.
DOCTOR: Ace, I think it's time for plan B.
ACE: We run?
DOCTOR: Yes, run!
ACE: There's no way out!
DOCTOR: Now is not the time to panic!
ACE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Now we panic!
ACE: It's some sort of automated defence system, isn't it.
DOCTOR: Yes. When I say run, run!
DOCTOR: Not that way!
ACE: Doctor, it's a dead end!
ACE:  Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hang on, Ace.
DOCTOR: I'm coming!
ACE: Doctor!
Part Three
WARMSLY: Yes, this site is where Arthur is supposed to have met Mordred in the final battle, and this lake, where Bedivere threw Excalibur.
ANCELYN: What do you know of Excalibur?
WARMSLY: King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, wrought by the lonely maiden of the lake, who rose up out of the water holding the sword Excalibur aloft.
ANCELYN: This lake?
WARMSLY: Thou rememberest how, in those old days, one summer noon, an arm rose up from out the bosom of the lake clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, holding the sword. And how I rode across and took it, and have worn it, like a king. It's all a myth, really. Honestly, women in water holding swords?
BAMBERA: Look!
WARMSLY: It's that wretched girl!
BAMBERA: What are you doing in the lake?
ACE: Drowning. Here, you can be King of England.
SHOU: Oi!
ANCELYN: Truly, the time of restitution has come.
DOCTOR: Come out, come out, wherever you are, you little tapeworm.
DOCTOR:  Oh.
BRIGADIER: I just can't let you out of my sight, can I, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. So you recognise me, then?
BRIGADIER: Yes. Who else would it be?
ELIZABETH: Who are you? What do you want? Pat! Come quickly, Patrick!
BAMBERA: Two people were down there and you didn't tell me.
WARMSLY: Well, I
BAMBERA: Down there, in a trap.
ACE: Yeah. Let's you in but it doesn't let you out.
WARMSLY: Yes, well, Ace got out all right.
BAMBERA: But the Doctor is still down there.
SHOU: And the Brigadier.
BAMBERA: I am the Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: So am I.
ACE: Hey, I thought it let you in but it doesn't let you out.
DOCTOR: It let me out.
BAMBERA: Brigadier, I thought you'd retired.
BRIGADIER: So did I, Brigadier. Now, is the perimeter secure? This whole area is crawling with armed extra-terrestrials and they're hostile.
DOCTOR: Same as ever, eh, Brigadier?
MORGAINE: He has possession of Excalibur. Knight Commander.
COMMANDER: My lady.
MORGAINE: Take your men along that road. Seek out those who hold Excalibur and take the sword from them.
COMMANDER: And if they resist?
MORGAINE: Give them an honourable death.
ANCELYN: My lord Merlin.
BRIGADIER: Merlin?
ANCELYN: Oh, he has many names.
BRIGADIER: He has many faces. And he has many companions. This must be the latest one.
BAMBERA: We've checked the perimeter. Doctor Warmsly is staying with the vehicles. 
BRIGADIER: Oh, thank you, Bambera. Oh, see if you can get a blanket for this young lady, will you?
BAMBERA: Yes, sir. Perhaps I should make some tea, too.
BRIGADIER: Well, are you all right, Miss?
ACE: Just call me the latest one, and I can get my own blanket.
BRIGADIER: Oh dear. Women. Not really my field.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Brigadier. People will be shooting at you soon.
PAT: Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH: Pat, is that you?
PAT: You all right?
ELIZABETH: Yes, I'm fine. I'm all right.
MORDRED: Your wife?
PAT: Yes.
MORDRED: With your aspect, it is well that she is blind.
LAVEL: Do you have a phone?
MORDRED: So, what have we here?
MORDRED: Ah, there is light in this grey world.
LAVEL: Don't move.
MORDRED: Am I to do nothing?
LAVEL: Yeah, you can get the tab if you like.
MORDRED: Light and fire. Come, drink with me!
LAVEL: I said, don't move.
MORDRED: Oh, I would wish for kinder words.
MORGAINE: Mordred. Who is this?
MORDRED: A warrior maid.
MORGAINE: A warrior? Good. I would learn the strength of their forces.
LAVEL: Stay back or I'll shoot.
MORGAINE: Be silent.
MORGAINE: Rest here and tell me.
MORGAINE: Ah.
MORGAINE: Quietly, my child.
MORGAINE: Now we know, Mordred.
PAT: You can't leave her like that.
MORGAINE: Did my son drink well? Oh, I see that it is so. I must get the tab.
PAT: Get away from here, you
ELIZABETH: I can see. Patrick, I can see!
BRIGADIER: Oh, Bambera, take the other car, will you?
BAMBERA: Yes, sir. Come on, Ancelyn. Looks like we get the deck chair.
ANCELYN: My lady is vexed.
DOCTOR: We might run into trouble.
BRIGADIER: Oh really, Doctor? You do surprise me. 
ACE: Winifred isn't following.
BRIGADIER: Good lord, is that her name?
BAMBERA: Now I'm vexed.
ANCELYN: What do you seek?
BAMBERA: Stay out of this. You don't even live here.
ANCELYN: Perhaps these?
BAMBERA:  No.
DOCTOR: Something's wrong.
BRIGADIER: What?
DOCTOR: We haven't been attacked yet.
BRIGADIER: Down!
SHOU: Are they gone?
WARMSLY: Who were they?
BRIGADIER: Now, Doctor, we've been attacked. Happy?
DOCTOR: Yes.
BRIGADIER: Oh, good.
DOCTOR: As long as Morgaine's people are shooting at us, she won't be using more obscure methods of attack.
BRIGADIER: Such as?
DOCTOR: I don't know, and I don't want to find out.
MORDRED: The Knight Commander will stop them.
MORGAINE: Stop Merlin? No, I will deal with Merlin in my own manner.
BRIGADIER : Over.
BAMBERA: Copy you, Greyhound. Will act accordingly. Over. You're from an alternative dimension?
ANCELYN: Yes.
BAMBERA: Good. You don't have cars there?
ANCELYN: No.
BAMBERA: Good. Hold on to this wheel.
COMMANDER: Magnificent!
BAMBERA : This is Seabird. Piece of cake, Greyhound One. We'll be with you shortly.
BRIGADIER: Much relieved to hear it, Seabird.
ACE: Professor, there's a whole pile of tinheads setting up on the road down there.
DOCTOR: Brigadier, tell Bambera she's in trouble.
BAMBERA: So, you married or what?
ACE: We've got to help them.
BRIGADIER: Well, what do you want us to do? The area's swarming with Morgaine's troops.
ACE: Doctor?
ACE: No.
BRIGADIER: Better get back to the hotel.
ELIZABETH: I can do it myself.
PAT: You'll have to excuse my wife. Half an hour ago she was blind. Now, just who are you?
HUSAK: Major Husak, sir.
PAT: Hmm. You're not English, are you.
HUSAK: No, sir. If you'd please get into the vehicle.
BRIGADIER: Everything under control?
HUSAK: No, sir.
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Major. You'll soon get the hang of it. Oh, this is the Doctor. Yeah, well, don't let him baffle you. And this is Peter Warmsly.
HUSAK: Ah, Mister Warmsly. If you'd join Mister Rawlinson in the vehicle, we'll evacuate you from the area.
PAT: Excuse me, there are a few questions I want answered.
WARMSLY: And I have absolutely no intention of being evacuated. This area is where I live.
DOCTOR: You're very angry.
PAT: Of course we're angry.
DOCTOR: And you want to leave.
WARMSLY: No, we do not want to leave.
DOCTOR: Of course you want to leave.
PAT: Of course we do.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't stand for any nonsense, if I were you.
WARMSLY: Look, Doctor, the situation is perfectly simple. We are very angry and we
WARMSLY: Want to leave. Is that right, Pat?
PAT: Don't get in our way.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't dream of it.
PAT: Just no reasoning with these people.
HUSAK: At the risk of being baffled, sir, I have one more evacuee on my list. A young lady.
DOCTOR: She seems to have disappeared.
BRIGADIER: Well, there you have it, Major.
DOCTOR: You've got enough weapons here to fight a war.
BRIGADIER: That's the general idea.
DOCTOR: It'll be useless, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: Not this time, Doctor. Over here!
BRIGADIER: Open that box, will you?
BRIGADIER: Armour piercing, solid core, with a Teflon coating. Go through a Dalek.
DOCTOR: A non-stick bullet.
BRIGADIER: UNIT's been very busy, Doctor. We've also got high-explosive rounds for Yeti's and very efficient armour-piercing rounds for robots. And we've even got gold-tipped bullets for you know what.
DOCTOR: No silver?
BRIGADIER: Silver bullets?
DOCTOR: Well, you never know.
BRIGADIER: Quartermaster Sergeant! Silver bullets. Have we any?
ACE: You can come out now, they've gone.
SHOU: That was close. I nearly got evacuated.
ACE: You may wish you had.
ACE: What's that?
DOCTOR: A shadow.
ACE: Professor, we've sussed out where the legend of King Arthur came from.
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, miss, er, young lady, but the Doctor and I have important matters to discuss.
ACE: We reckon that when Ancelyn's lot dumped the freeze-dried king in the lake they must have told the story to some local.
SHOU: But they couldn't handle the more outr� aspects.
ACE: So they translated it into terms they could understand. And so old frozen chicken becomes King of the Britons.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I really must
DOCTOR: No, Brigadier, this is important.
ACE: Since that's Excalibur
DOCTOR: It must be the source of Arthur's power.
ACE: And a vital control element to the spaceship under the lake. It wasn't stuck in the stone, it was plugged in.
DOCTOR: Could be.
ACE: I bet Ancelyn knows. Knew.
BRIGADIER: Major Husak is leading a detachment to recover the bodies of Brigadier Bambera and Ancelyn.
ACE: What good are their bodies?
BRIGADIER: UNIT looks after its own, alive or dead, and I want these ashes buried with honour.
[The truck stops by a burning tyre and a blue beret. Husak radios in.)
HUSAK: Husak to HQ. The Seabirds are still operational. I repeat, the Seabirds are still operational.
BRIGADIER: Doctor! Bambera and Ancelyn are alive.
DOCTOR: They're alive?
BRIGADIER: And Major Husak said they seem to be heading north from here.
DOCTOR: Towards the missile convoy.
BRIGADIER: Yes. Bambera's own unit is there.
DOCTOR: But if they lead Morgaine's troops
BRIGADIER: It's a fully armed nuclear missile.
DOCTOR: If there's an accident. We'd better stop any engagement. Have you got a helicopter available?
BRIGADIER: Oh, better than that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Bessie!
BRIGADIER: Well, I knew how fond of it you were, so when you last went on your travels I had it put in mothballs.
ACE: Does it run on petrol or steam?
BAMBERA: Ancelyn! Ancelyn! Can't you do anything quietly?
BAMBERA: You're going to bring Morgaine's whole army down on us.
ANCELYN: Let them come. Do you not know I am the best knight in the world?
BAMBERA: Ancelyn.
ANCELYN: Yes, my lady?
BAMBERA: In this world we have a great and honourable tradition of tactical withdrawal.
ANCELYN: Ah, you wish to run away. Well, there can be but thirty of them at the most.
BAMBERA: If you don't start running, I'll kill you myself. Now come on!
ANCELYN: Winifred?
BAMBERA: What?
ANCELYN: Art thou betrothed?
BAMBERA: Not now, Ancelyn!
DOCTOR: Ace, things may get dangerous, so I want you to have this.
ACE: It looks like a piece of chalk.
DOCTOR: It is. I got it from the dartboard. But it will protect you against Morgaine's sorcery.
ACE: A piece of chalk?
DOCTOR: A piece of chalk. At the first sign of anything strange, I want you to draw a chalk circle, and you and Shou Yuing stay inside it along with Excalibur.
ACE: Right, Professor. Chalk circle. Sure.
DOCTOR: And remember, stay inside the circle. Don't leave it until I return.
ACE: Doctor, you are coming back, aren't you?
DOCTOR: Trust me. Ready, Brigadier?
BRIGADIER: Ready.
ACE: Naught to sixty in twenty minutes.
SHOU: As fast as that?
DOCTOR: Appearances can be deceiving, Ace.
DOCTOR: And remember, look after Excalibur and stay in the circle.
ACE: Gordon Bennett.
SHOU: Wicked.
MORGAINE: Merlin, you fool. To place such a trust in children. I swear that you shall rue this day, if you live.
SHOU: What are they?
ACE: Silver bullets.
SHOU: Really?
SHOU: What did the Doctor say? At the first sign of something strange
ACE: Looks like Colonel Blimp has a fancy taste in hardware.
SHOU: You don't like him much, do you?
ACE: I like to be treated as a person, not A latest one. Anyway, I don't trust him to guard the Professor's back. That's my job.
SHOU: Do you think that counts as strange?
ACE: Where's the chalk?
MORGAINE: With fire, I shall summon you. With silver I shall bind you.
ACE: Do you think we should sprinkle holy water or something?
SHOU: I don't know. It's not my mythology.
SHOU: Ace?
ACE: Yeah?
SHOU: What's happening?
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I've just received the most peculiar from the hotel.
DOCTOR: Does it say anything about Ace and Shou Yuing?
BRIGADIER: No. All it said was, night has fallen here.
DOCTOR: I'll deal with that later. First, I've got to put an end to this bloodshed.
BRIGADIER: Oh, how, Doctor? Stand in the middle and shout stop?
DOCTOR: Good idea.
ACE: Stupid.
SHOU: What did you say?
ACE: What?
SHOU: Nothing.
ACE: This is stupid.
SHOU: What did you call me?
ACE: I said, this is stupid. You deaf or something?
SHOU: No you didn't. I heard you. You called me stupid.
ACE: I'm not a freak.
SHOU: What?
ACE: I said, I'm not a freak. I'm Ace. Are you dumb or what?
SHOU: I'm not stupid.
ACE: Then why do you keep saying stupid things?
SHOU: That's good, coming from a reject like you.
ACE: Listen here, toad-face. Just you shut your mouth or I'll knock your teeth in!
SHOU: I bet nobody likes you.
ACE: Shut up.
SHOU: First chance he got, the Doctor went off without you.
ACE: Shut up! Shut up!
SHOU: I bet even your parents hated your guts!
ACE: Shut up, you yellow, slant-eyed
ACE: Someone's playing games with our minds.
MORGAINE: Oh, they breed their children strong on this world. Huh. No matter. There shall be an end to these games.
BAMBERA: Get out, they're coming this way!
ANCELYN: Mordred! Face me, Mordred! Mordred!
ANCELYN: Is your army not enough to give you courage?
MORDRED: Courage? Ha, to face you, Ancelyn, who fled the field at Camlan? Ancelyn the Craven, I call you.
ANCELYN: What care I for the words of a half-man who cowers from a woman's wrath.
DOCTOR: Stop! I command it! There will be no battle here!
MORDRED: This is no battle. Tis but a ruse, a diversion. My mother hath summoned the Destroyer, the Lord of Darkness, Eater of Worlds. Look to your children, Merlin, for soon they shall be no more.
DOCTOR: Ace, what have I done?
MORGAINE: I am Morgaine of the Fey. I am power beyond your imagining. Surrender to me what is mine by right of conquest. Give me Excalibur.
ACE: Never!
MORGAINE: Then you shall be given over to the Destroyer.
MORGAINE: And become his handmaidens in hell. Bwahahahaha!
Part Four
DOCTOR: Tell Morgaine to call off the Destroyer.
MORDRED: Surrender to our justice and the children will live.
DOCTOR: Your justice? Tell her to call it off or I will decapitate you.
MORGAINE: Now we shall see what is happening. Oh. He must care for you very much to threaten my son so. Fear not. It is a deception.
MORGAINE : He is bluffing.
MORDRED: We know you of old, Merlin. You will not kill.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't count on it.
MORDRED: Come then, look me in the eye. End my life.
MORDRED: It is a weakness, this lack of spirit.
BRIGADIER: Try me.
MORGAINE: Ware this man, Mordred. He is steeped in blood.
DOCTOR: Brigadier, this is not the way.
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor. Can Morgaine hear me?
MORDRED: Yes.
BRIGADIER: Listen to me, Morgaine. Leave my world or your son dies.
MORDRED: Deathless Morgaine.
MORDRED : Save me!
MORGAINE: Die well, my son.
MORDRED: Mother!
MORGAINE: Knight Commander.
COMMANDER: Your Majesty.
MORGAINE : Recommence your attack.
MORGAINE: Take no prisoners.
ACE: No!
COMMANDER: We shall make honour our standard. Put down your guns, draw your swords. Good steel will be our conscience. Do them honour. Kill them all.
ANCELYN: This is our path, to fight and die.
BAMBERA: That's what we're paid for, so let's do it with some style!
MORDRED: My mother will destroy you.
BRIGADIER: Just between you and me, Mordred, I'm getting a little tired of hearing about your mother. Get in.
DOCTOR: Hold tight.
MORGAINE: Your friends will soon be dead.
MORGAINE: Now, give me Excalibur.
ACE: If you're so powerful, why don't you come and get it?
MORGAINE: An excellent suggestion.
MORGAINE: The sword is protecting you.
ACE: The Doctor was right. You can't touch us while we're in the circle. Not while we've got the paper knife.
MORGAINE: This is true. I cannot break such an enchantment.
DESTROYER: But I can.
ACE: If you're so bad, why haven't you done anything yet?
DESTROYER: First I must be freed. This mortal has me chained.
MORGAINE: With silver.
DESTROYER: It burns.
MORGAINE: Good.
DESTROYER: She fears me.
MORGAINE: I fear nothing.
DESTROYER: Then free me, and let me claim this world.
MORGAINE: Perhaps.
ACE: What does he want the world for?
DESTROYER: Why, to devour it. What else?
DOCTOR: Ace!
BRIGADIER: Doctor, no!
DOCTOR: Morgaine! If they're dead
BRIGADIER: Decisions, decisions.
DOCTOR: Ace!
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I'm afraid that Mordred m
DOCTOR: Ace? Shou Yuing?
ACE: We're here, Professor.
DOCTOR: What happened?
SHOU: The hotel fell on us.
ACE: There was this woman with a pet demon, and I seem to remember a chalk circle that was supposed to protect us from harm.
DOCTOR: Yes, I get the idea, Ace. Where's Excalibur?
SHOU: Er, the woman seemed to want it very badly.
ACE: Very, very badly.
SHOU: So we gave it to her.
DOCTOR: Good.
ACE: But it's not our fault. I mean, if I'd had some Nitro, then maybe I could. What do you mean, good?
DOCTOR: Exotic alien swords are easy to come by. Aces are rare.
BRIGADIER: Doctor? What do you make of this?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Which way did Morgaine leave?
ACE: A flash of light and gone.
DOCTOR: I wonder.
MORGAINE: Where is my army?
DESTROYER: Gone the way of all flesh.
ANCELYN: A good fight.
ANCELYN: You are hurt, my lady.
BAMBERA: I told you not to. Oh, never mind.
DOCTOR: Timing.
CHOU: They're going to be killed. You saw the Destroyer.
ACE: Morgaine could control the Destroyer. She had it chained up with silver chains. Get it?
SHOU: The silver bullets!
ACE: Keep an eye on the vortex.
SHOU: It's fading.
ACE: Got them!
SHOU: It's going. What're you going to do, throw them through?
ACE: Do me a favour. Geronimo!
DESTROYER: You would do well to release me, Morgaine.
MORGAINE: Release you?
DESTROYER: Merlin is mighty and cunning. I cannot destroy him while I am chained.
MORGAINE: What matter? I have Excalibur. Without it, Arthur sleeps forever. Merlin cannot find me ere I leave. See! The gateway home is almost complete.
DESTROYER: He comes even as we speak.
MORGAINE: How? He cannot come through the vortex. You have allowed him access. Why?
DESTROYER: So that you would be forced to release me.
DOCTOR: Morgaine.
DOCTOR: Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: Well, nothing ventured, Doctor.
DESTROYER: Nothing gained.
DOCTOR: That was uncalled for.
MORGAINE: Your move, Merlin.
DOCTOR: You haven't won the game yet, Morgaine.
MORGAINE: I could always defeat you at chess, Merlin.
DOCTOR: Who said anything about playing chess? I'm playing poker.
DOCTOR: And I have an Ace up my sleeve.
ACE: Very funny.
MORGAINE: Destroy him.
DESTROYER: Release me.
DOCTOR: What is it to be, Morgaine? Who do you fear more?
MORGAINE: This is no idle threat, Merlin. Give me Excalibur or I will loose the Destroyer upon the world.
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool.
ACE: Nice work, Doctor.
DOCTOR: But I thought she was bluffing.
MORDRED: Where is she?
BRIGADIER: To whom are you referring?
DESTROYER: Free!
DOCTOR: You fool, Morgaine.
DOCTOR: Do you think this'll solve anything?
MORGAINE: Yes. Too late, Merlin. The gateway is open. I am gone and you have lost.
ACE: Doctor, I've got a silver bullet!
MORDRED: Mother!
MORGAINE: Mordred?
DOCTOR: About time.
MORGAINE: You live.
MORDRED: In spite of thee, false parent. Witch!
MORGAINE: I thought you dead.
MORDRED: Thought? Or wished it so.
MORGAINE: Mordred, no. That was not the way of it. No.
ACE: Doctor, can I have a word?
BRIGADIER: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Brigadier, you're going the wrong way. Ace!
DESTROYER: At last.
DESTROYER: Devour.
BRIGADIER: What was that?
DOCTOR: That, Brigadier, was the beginning of the end of the world.
BRIGADIER: Same as ever, eh, Doctor?
DESTROYER: I hunger.
DOCTOR: It's no good. It's not good at all.
BRIGADIER: I can have an air strike here in minutes.
DOCTOR: It's no good, Brigadier. Conventional weapons won't harm it.
BRIGADIER: No, I didn't think so.
DOCTOR: Ace, give me the silver bullets.
ACE: How did you know?
DOCTOR: Silver bullets'll do the trick.
ACE: How did you know I had them?
DOCTOR: It's all a matter of timing, Ace. Give me your gun.
BRIGADIER: What, those will stop the Destroyer? What, you just shoot the bullets into it?
DOCTOR: Simple, isn't it? Just like most killings.
BRIGADIER: Good lord, is that a spaceship?
ACE: You scumbag!
BRIGADIER: Sorry, Doctor, but I think I'm rather more expendable than you are.
DESTROYER: This world shall be mine. And then another, and another.
DESTROYER: Ah, little man. What do you want of me?
BRIGADIER: Get off my world.
DOCTOR: We've got to stop him.
DESTROYER: Pitiful. Can this world do no better than you as their champion?
BRIGADIER: Probably. I just do the best I can.
ACE: No chance. He's had it.
BAMBERA: Sergeant, where's that coffee? Sergeant!
MORDRED: The battle's not over yet.
DOCTOR: You stupid, stubborn, pig-headed numbskull. You were supposed to die in bed. I could have handled it, done your job.
BRIGADIER: Nonsense, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're supposed to be dead.
BRIGADIER: Oh, really, Doctor. You don't think I'd be so stupid as to stay inside, do you?
DOCTOR: Well
BRIGADIER: Really, Doctor, have a little faith. Ace?
ACE: Yes, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. He's all yours from now on. I'm going home to Doris.
DOCTOR: Doris?
BRIGADIER: Yes, my wife.
DOCTOR: Ha, ha, ha. So she caught you in the end.
BRIGADIER: Yeah.
ACE: Oi, shouldn't we be getting back?
BRIGADIER: Yes, Ace is right. I suspect there's some clearing up to be done.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a small nuclear missile bogged down in a nature reserve.
BAMBERA: It's a nuclear missile. The blast will kill you as well.
MORGAINE: We shall be long gone ere that happens. Now tell me, what is the secret incantation?
BAMBERA: I don't know what you're talking about.
MORGAINE: The magic words. The failsafe release code.
BAMBERA: I've no idea.
MORGAINE: Oh, I doubt that. What is the code?
DOCTOR: Ancelyn, replace Excalibur and Arthur will arise.
ANCELYN: I think the honour belongs to the Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: Oh, the Doctor should do it.
ANCELYN: No, my lord. You were the victor.
ACE: Give me that.
DOCTOR: Ace, have you no sense of occasion?
ACE: No.
ANCELYN: Listen, she is alive.
ACE: Which is more than can be said for Arthur the freeze-dried.
DOCTOR: This is very odd.
ACE: Well, you put him there.
DOCTOR: I will put him there.
ACE: What's wrong, Doctor?
ANCELYN: Where is the King?
ACE: Doctor, this is for you.
DOCTOR: What does it say?
ACE: Dear Doctor. King died in final battle. Everything else propaganda.
DOCTOR: Who signed it?
ACE: The Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah well, that sorts that out.
ACE: PS, Morgaine has just seized control of the nuclear missile.
DOCTOR: Tut. I could have given myself more warning. Brigadier, you and Ace see to this ship.
BRIGADIER: Explosives, Doctor.
ACE: Now you're talking.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll give Arthur a warrior's burial.
MORGAINE: Too late, Merlin.
DOCTOR: Is it? Not while there's an abort button.
DOCTOR: If this missile explodes, millions will die, you will die.
MORGAINE: I shall die with honour.
DOCTOR: All over the world, fools are poised ready to let death fly. A spark could turn into an inferno.
MORGAINE: What do I care? This is war.
DOCTOR: Is it? Death falling from the sky, blind, random, anywhere, anytime. No one is safe, no one is innocent? Machines of death, Morgaine, are screaming from above, of light brighter than the sun. Not a war between armies nor a war between nations, but just death, death gone mad. The child looks up in the sky, his eyes turn to cinders. No more tears, only ashes. Is this honour? Is this war? Are these the weapons you would use? Tell me!
MORGAINE: No.
DOCTOR: Then put a stop to it, Morgaine. End the madness.
MORGAINE: Then tell Arthur to face me with honour in single combat. Tell him to show himself. It's time he ceased hiding behind your coat tails, Merlin.
ACE: And you said two kilos wouldn't be enough.
BRIGADIER: Hey, mind you don't get your feet wet.
DOCTOR: Arthur is dead.
MORGAINE: No.
DOCTOR: He's dead, Morgaine.
MORGAINE: Merlin, prince of deceit. Another trick.
DOCTOR: No.
MORGAINE: I don't believe you.
DOCTOR: Don't you?
MORGAINE: It can't be.
DOCTOR: He died over a thousand years ago.
MORGAINE: Arthur, who burned like star fire.
DOCTOR: Gone.
MORGAINE: And was as beautiful. Where does he lie? I would look at him one final time.
DOCTOR: He's gone to dust.
MORGAINE: Then I shall not even have that comfort. I shall never see him again. Arthur. We were together in the woods of Celadon. The air was like honey.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Morgaine. It's over.
ANCELYN: I do not fear death, Mordred. You have slain my beloved. There is no life without her.
MORDRED: So be it. Tis time!
DOCTOR: Time and Time Lords wait for no man.
DOCTOR: Ah, Brigadier. Before Mordred recovers, lock him up. And while you're at it, lock up his mother.
DOCTOR: Peaceful, isn't it?
ANCELYN: The silence after a battle, Doctor.
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, I'm not being a very good host. Are you all right out here?
DOCTOR: Oh, just admiring the garden.
BRIGADIER: I don't suppose you've seen Doris, have you?
DORIS: Bye!
DOCTOR: I think the battle may be about to begin.
BRIGADIER: You going somewhere, dear?
DORIS: Out.
BRIGADIER: Out?
DORIS: Out, with the girls.
DOCTOR: I thought you said this was a piece of antiquated junk?
ACE: Did I say that, Professor?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SHOU: We'll try not to break too many speed records.
BAMBERA: Or traffic laws.
DORIS: Hey, what's that?
ACE: Do you want to drive, Doris?
DORIS: Oh, no. Er, I'll drive on the way back, okay?
DOCTOR: Allow me.
DORIS: Thank you, Doctor. Whee!
BRIGADIER: Er, exactly how far are you intending to go, Doris?
DORIS: Well, I don't know, but there's lots of work to be done in the garden. Roll the grass.
BRIGADIER: What about supper?
DORIS: Oh, that's a good idea. Have something really delicious ready for us when we get home, okay?
DORIS: Oh, wicked!
ANCELYN: Ah, are they not magnificent?
BRIGADIER: Yeah. Are you any good with a lawn mower, Ancelyn?
DOCTOR: I'll cook supper.
