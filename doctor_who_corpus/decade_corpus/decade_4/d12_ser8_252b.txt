Death in Heaven
Previously
CLARA: Danny Pink is dead.
DOCTOR: We're here to get your boyfriend back from the dead. Those are tombs. Water tombs. Why would anyone go to so much trouble?
SEB: You're dead and, and this is what's next.
DOCTOR: A Gallifreyan hard drive. Time Lord technology.
MISSY: Do you know the key strategic weakness of the human race? The dead outnumber the living.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
MISSY: Oh, you know who I am. I'm Missy. I couldn't very well keep calling myself The Master, now could I?
CLARA: Stop! You can't kill me.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Incorrect.
CLARA: I'm a target of strategic value. Alive, I'm a tactical advantage. Dead, I'm your biggest mistake.You don't know who I am.
CYBER-SKAROSA: You are Clara Oswald. You are human. You are unimportant.
CLARA: Incorrect. You see, That is what you're supposed to think. That is what everybody thinks.
CYBER-SKAROSA: You are Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Clara Oswald is a cover story, a disguise. There is no Clara Oswald.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Identify.
CLARA: Oh, don't be so slow, it's embarrassing. Who could fool you like this? Who could hide right under your nose? Who could change their face any time they want? Hmm. You see, I'm not Clara Oswald. Clara Oswald has never existed.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Identify.
CLARA: I'm the Doctor.
MISSY: Look at them! My boys.
DOCTOR: Cybermen in broad daylight? You think people won't notice?
MISSY: Photos with the big metal men, one pound.
MISSY: Oh, honey!
BOY: There you go.
GIRL Oh, cool. Cool!
MISSY: New York. Paris. Rome. Marrakesh. Brisbane. Glasgow. Everywhere. Anywhere. Me and my boys. We're going viral.
OSGOOD: Would you like me to take a picture? Sorry, selfies are never as good, are they? And you're having a lovely moment. Hang on!
MISSY: No, just
DOCTOR: Nice bow tie.
OSGOOD: Bow ties are cool. Big smiles, and now!
SOLDIERS: Move, move, move! Stand by. Surround target. Hold back!
KATE: Afternoon. You've picked a lovely day for it. My, don't you look shiny.  Haircut?
DOCTOR: Bit of a trim.
KATE: Might want to do your roots. The woman.
SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am.
KATE: Kate Stewart. Divorcee, mother of two, keen gardener, outstanding bridge player. Also Chief Scientific Officer, Unified Intelligence Taskforce, who currently have you surrounded.
CYBERMAN: Human weaponry is not effective against Cyber technology.
KATE: Sorry, you left this behind on one of your previous attempts.
KATE: So now that I have your attention, welcome to the only planet in the universe where we get to say this. He's on the payroll.
DOCTOR: Am I?
KATE: Well, technically.
DOCTOR: How much?
KATE: Shush. Any questions?
SOLDIER: Back, back, everyone, back!
OSGOOD: Oh, my God! Is it supposed to do that? Is that new?
DOCTOR: A sun roof on Saint Paul's? Yes, I'd say that was new.
KATE: There's going to be mass panic. Everyone in London can see that.
DOCTOR: Everyone in London just clapped and went whee. Hush, I'm trying to count.
OSGOOD: Eighty seven, I think. OCD.
MISSY: Ninety one. Queen of evil.
KATE: How could Saint Paul's be full of ninety one Cybermen and nobody noticed?
DOCTOR: Dimensional engineering. One space folded inside another. Bigger on the inside. Easy if you're a Time Lord.
OSGOOD: Mostly deploying south, a smaller number east.
DOCTOR: Yep, but one straight up.
OSGOOD: So ninety one isn't a coincidence?
DOCTOR: Of course it isn't.
KATE: Osgood? Ninety one. Explain.
OSGOOD: Ninety one areas of significant population density in the British Isles.
DOCTOR: That's one Cyberman for every city and major town. It's happening everywhere, all over the world, right now.
MISSY: Sweet planet, this. I think I might keep it.
KATE: One Cyberman per city. What could they hope to accomplish?
OSGOOD: Doctor!
KATE: Has it exploded?
MISSY: More than that. Cybermen don't just blow themselves up for no good reason, dear. They're not human.
DOCTOR: If it's not exploding, what's it doing?
MISSY: Pollinating. Falling like rain into the cracks of the Earth.
SEB: Well, this is a bit exciting!
DANNY: What's happening?
SEB: Well, to cut a long story short, it looks like we might all be going home.
DANNY: Home? From the afterlife?
SEB: Well, when I said afterlife, I was being a tiny bit poetic. And Nethersphere's just a cool name we come up with during a spit-ball.
DANNY: What is this place?
SEB: Well, you have to think of it as a data cloud. You know, for storing data. In this case, it's the storage of recently deceased minds.
DANNY: We're in a cloud?
SEB: A sort of cloud, yeah.
DANNY: And what's happening to it?
SEB: What happens to any cloud when it starts to rain.
DANNY: Are you telling me we're going back? What, back to our bodies?
SEB: And the extra good news is, there's been a bit of an upgrade.
MISSY: The dead are coming home, Doctor. All shiny and new. In twenty four hours the human race as you know it will cease to exist.
DOCTOR: What are you doing? Explain. Tell me now.
MISSY: Oh! That was nice. Must do it again.
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, I need to talk to her! I need her awake.
DOCTOR: Argh! No. No, no. Stupid. Stupid! No, no. Argh!
KATE: The first protocol is implemented. We're good to go.
OSGOOD: You just have to let it take you.
KATE: What did he say?
OSGOOD: He said, guard the graveyards.
TEENAGE BOY: That's weird. Look at that.
NEWS REPORT: We are being told that these metal men are known as Cybermen, but unlike the accounts we have on file, they now have the ability to fly. Similar reports are coming in from all over the world. Flying Cybermen are here on a global scale. Ministers are telling us
NEWS REPORT: To remain calm. 'These Cybermen don't seem to be attacking us, at least not in any conventional fashion. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing them flying into the sky 
GRAHAM: Hello? Hello?
 
MAN: Right. Be careful with it. Be careful. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Kate? What's with the handcuffs?
KATE: I'm sorry. In the event of an alien incursion on this scale, protocols are in place. Your co-operation is to be ensured and your unreliability assumed. You have a history.
DOCTOR: You don't have a future without me. Do you think your father would've done this?
KATE: We both know he absolutely would.
KATE: Who is she?
DOCTOR: Long story. Where's Clara?
KATE: Clara Oswald, your assistant?
DOCTOR: My friend. She was with me in Saint Paul's.
KATE: The team's still on site but they've been unable to gain access to the building.
DOCTOR: I want her found and brought here. I need her with me.
KATE: Then give the order. As soon as you're on board Boat One your word is law. Quite literally.
DOCTOR: You got the Tardis out, though?
KATE: Yes, and Saint Paul's locked down.
DOCTOR: Where are we going? Cloudbase?
KATE: You mean the Valiant?
OSGOOD: Cloudbase was Thunderbirds.
KATE: Too conspicuous. We need your location concealed, not advertised. From now on you're a moving target.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see you're bringing Daddy along, too. That's very sweet.
AHMED: Sir.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't do that. You look like you're self-concussing, which would explain all of military history, now I think about it.
AHMED: Colonel Ahmed, sir. Privileged to meet you.
DOCTOR: Love your outfit, Colonel Ahmed. Are you in the Scouts? Are you a Man Scout? I didn't know they had those.
AHMED: It was Captain Scarlet.
OSGOOD: Sorry?
AHMED: Not Thunderbirds.
OSGOOD: Oh God, so it was,
DOCTOR: My confidence is growing every minute.
KATE: The President is on board.
DOCTOR: Mind you, me and Sylvia Anderson, you've never seen a foxtrot like it. Hang on a second. The President? We don't want Americans bobbing around the place. They'll only start praying.
AHMED: Not the President of America, sir. The President of Earth.
DOCTOR: There isn't one.
AHMED: There is now.
KATE: The incursion protocols have been agreed internationally. In the event of full-scale invasion, an Earth President is inducted immediately, with complete authority over every nation state. There was only one practical candidate.
DOCTOR: That's your answer for everything, isn't it? Vote for an idiot.
KATE: If you say so, Mister President. So long as you're on this plane, you're the Commander in Chief of every army on Earth. Every world leader is currently awaiting your instructions. You are the Chief Executive Officer of the human race. Any questions?
CAPTAIN : This is your captain speaking. Please prepare for take-off.
CLARA: Well, gentlemen. Where to start? I was born on the planet Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborous. I'm a Time Lord, but my Prydonian privileges were revoked when I stole a time capsule and ran away. Currently pilot a Type 40 Tardis. I've been married four times, all deceased. My children and grandchildren are missing, and I assume, dead. I have a non-Gallifreyan daughter created via genetic transfer. How much more do you need? I'm the Doctor.
CYBER-SKAROSA: This information is not proof. We require proof.
CLARA: How about my name?
CYBER-SKAROSA: Explain.
CLARA: Well, my name isn't Doctor, is it? I don't even really have a doctorate. Well, Glasgow University, but then I accidentally graduated in the wrong century, so technically
CYBER-SKAROSA: This information cannot be confirmed.
CYBERMAN: You are Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Ah, no. I'm not!
CYBERMAN: Your deception is intended to prolong your life.
CYBER-SKAROSA: Your presence has not been ordered.
CYBERMAN: Correct. You are Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Oh, seriously, this is getting old. Look, there is no Clara Oswald. I invented her. I made her up.
CYBERMAN: Born 23rd November, 1986.
CLARA: Yeah, I chose that date. Always liked it.
CYBERMAN: Father, David James Oswald. Mother, Elena Alison Oswald.
CLARA: Stories. Stories. Stories. I made them up. Look, ask anybody who knows me. I am an incredible liar.
CYBERMAN: Correct.
CYBER-SKAROSA: No order was given.
CYBERMAN: Correct.
CYBER-SKAROSA: You are not under Cyber control.
CYBERMAN: Correct.
DOCTOR: Why are you still alive?
MISSY: You saved me.
DOCTOR: I saved Gallifrey.
MISSY: Yes, Gallifrey too, I suppose. There's always collateral damage with you and me. It's our Paris.
DOCTOR: Gallifrey's lost in another dimension.
MISSY: Yes and no.
DOCTOR: Meaning?
MISSY: Yes, it's in another dimension. No, it's not lost.
DOCTOR: You know where it is?
MISSY: Yep! You know the best part about knowing?  Not telling you.
AHMED : Mister President, sir, we're ready for you up here.
DOCTOR: Remember all those years when all you wanted to do was to rule the world? On my way.
AHMED : Thank you, Mister President.
DOCTOR: Piece of cake.
OSGOOD: Oh, er, it's her little device thingy. I thought there might be useful information on it. Who is she?
DOCTOR: You'd never believe me if I told you.
OSGOOD: Cos I thought she might be the Master, regenerated into female form? Your childhood friend, responsible for a number of previous incursions.
DOCTOR: That was fairly quick.
OSGOOD: We do have files on all our ex-prime ministers. She wasn't even the worst. Doctor, there's something nobody's talking about.
DOCTOR: Which is?
OSGOOD: The clouds caused by the exploding Cybermen, they haven't dispersed. They're still there. In fact, they've expanded and are covering almost all the land masses. We're all looking at the graveyards. Maybe we should be looking up? What do you think?
DOCTOR: All of time and space?
OSGOOD: Sorry?
DOCTOR: Just something for your bucket list.
NEWS REPORT: Localised rain in the cemeteries has resulted in what can only be described as disturbances to the soil. Extraordinary eyewitness accounts are claiming that silver creatures are climbing from the graves.
KATE: These scenes are being repeated everywhere. Every cemetery, every mortuary, every funeral home, every hospital, the dead are returning to life as Cybermen.
NEWS REPORT: The public are being advised to stay away from all cemeteries.
CLARA: Hello? Hello?
KATE: We've done heat scans of some of the cemeteries and, in each case only a handful of Cybermen have so far emerged. But every individual burial site is active.
AHMED: Active?
DOCTOR: Hatching.
KATE: More are coming. Potentially millions.
AHMED: So the rain caused all that in just a few hours?
DOCTOR: It wasn't rain, Man Scout. It was pollen. Cyber-pollen. Every tiny particle of a Cyberman contains the plans to make another Cyberman. All it has to do is to make a contact with compatible living organic matter and bang! Full conversion. But if they have learned how to convert the dead.
DOCTOR: That's what she was doing. That's what 3W was for. She creates an all-new paranoia among the super-rich about dying. She exploits the wealth and the mortal remains of selected idiots so she can create a whole new race of Cybermen. Cybermen who can recruit corpses. Throw away your guns, Man Scout, it's all over. How can you win a war against an enemy that can weaponise the dead?
AHMED: They're not attacking, apart from isolated incidents. They're just wandering about.
DOCTOR: They're newborns. Give them time. Why were you there this morning? Why were you already attacking?
KATE: Been investigating 3W for a while, then we got a tip-off.
AHMED: From a woman with a Scottish accent.
DOCTOR: Can't play to the gallery unless there's a gallery, and here I am.
DOCTOR: Dead bodies don't have minds, of course, but she's been upgrading dying minds to a hard drive for a long time. So she upgrades the hardware, and then she updates the software.
KATE: What do you mean, a long time? How long?
DOCTOR: Well, she must have a Tardis somewhere, so as long as she likes. The past, the future 
KATE: How long, Doctor?
DOCTOR: How long has the human race had a concept of an afterlife? Turns out the afterlife is real, and it's emptying. Every graveyard on planet Earth is about to burst its banks.
MISSY:  Hey, Missy, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey, Missy. Hey.  Excuse me. Hi. Can I tell you something really important?
OSGOOD: What.
MISSY:  I have to whisper it. It's, like, so important to everyone on this plane. You'll get in trouble if you don't listen.
OSGOOD: Right. If it was that important, why would you tell us?
MISSY: Well, look at me, I'm bananas.  Come on. Just a wee bit closer. Just a little closer.  You know, the Doctor will be really impressed if you learn my secret. You can come a bit closer than that. Come on, stop mucking about. Don't be shy. You don't smell half as bad as you think you do.
OSGOOD: There are two armed men directly behind you.
MISSY:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OSGOOD: If you've got something to say, just say it.
MISSY: Ahem.
MISSY:  I'm going to kill you in a minute. I'm not even kidding. You're going to be as dead as a fish on a slab any second now, all floppy and making smells. But don't tell the boys. This is our secret girl plan.
OSGOOD: Why would you bother killing me? I'm not even important.
MISSY: Oh, silly. Why does one pop a balloon? Because you're pretty. You should have a bit more confidence in yourself.
OSGOOD: Okay. Sorry, I've got work to do.
MISSY: All right, fine. You get on. You get that finished. Would a countdown help you focus at all?
OSGOOD: No, that's okay.
MISSY: Ten. Don't be scared yet, cos I'm still in double figures.
OSGOOD: I'm not scared.
MISSY: Nine. Well, no, of course you're not, cos you know you're dying anyway. Eight. Human beings are born dying.Your life spans are hilarious.
OSGOOD: Please be quiet.
MISSY: Seven. You know from the minute you slop out, you're rotting, decaying. The stench of you. Phew. I'm never going to get this place clean. Three.
OSGOOD: Three?
MISSY: I'm accelerating for dramatic effect. Oh! What's that in your pocket?
OSGOOD: There's nothing in my pocket
MISSY: Oh my giddy aunt. The quiet ones are the worst.
OSGOOD: Well, those aren't mine.
MISSY: Hmm.
MISSY: Then they must be mine.
MISSY: Say something nice.
OSGOOD: Missy, the Master, whatever you call yourself, I promise, I'm much more useful to you alive.
MISSY: Oh, yeah, that's true. That's definitely true. That is a good point well made. I'm proud of you, sister. But did I mention bananas! Pop.
MISSY: Ah. Thanks for being yummy.
MISSY: Whoo-oo!
KATE: Mister President, you need to get back in your seat.
DOCTOR: I don't like being the president. People keep saluting. I'm never going to salute back.
KATE: Do you know, that was always my dad's big ambition, to get you to salute him just once.
DOCTOR: He should've asked.
KATE: Doctor, what are you looking at?
DOCTOR: The clouds. Still there. So what else have they got?
KATE: Oh, dear Lord!
DOCTOR: There's a Cyberman out there on the fuselage. But on the plus side, it's not turbulence.
DOCTOR: She's out. Who let her out?
AHMED: What's it doing? Where did it go? What can one Cyberman do to a plane?
MISSY: Oh, she was really scared. It's classic. Have you got any more friends I can play with?
CYBERMEN: Locate hive. Locate hive. Locate hive. Locate hive.  
CLARA: Are you the one that brought me here?
CYBERMAN: Affirmative.
CLARA: So you know who I am, right?
CYBERMAN: You are not the Doctor.
CLARA: Of course I'm not the Doctor. I was lying to stay alive. But how do I know so much about him?
CYBERMAN: You are his associate.
CLARA: No, I'm not. I'm not his associate. I'm his best friend. Right now, his best friend, anywhere in the universe. Have you got any sort of Cyber-Internet in there because, really, you should look it up. Look up what happens to you if you harm me.
CYBERMAN: Where is the Doctor?
CLARA: What, you think I would give up the Doctor? Don't be daft. I would never, ever, give up the Doctor, because he is my best friend, too. He is the closest person to me in this whole world. He is the man I will always forgive, always trust. The one man I would never, ever lie to.
CLARA: Danny?
CYBER-DANNY: Danny Pink is dead. Help me.
CLARA: Oh, my God. Danny
CYBER-DANNY: Help me.
CLARA: Danny, I am so sorry.
CYBER-DANNY: Help me. I need you to do something for me. I can't do it myself.
CLARA: What is that?
CYBER-DANNY: It's an inhibitor. It's not activated. I need you to switch it on.
CLARA: What does it inhibit?
CYBER-DANNY: Emotion. It deletes emotions. Please. I don't want to feel like this.
AHMED: There's more than one.
KATE: What?
AHMED: They're all over the plane. They're pulling it apart!
MISSY: Oh, oooh. Ask me.
DOCTOR: Shut up!
MISSY: Ask me! Come on, you know you want to. You want to know what my plan is. You'll be surprised. I've got a gift for you. You know, I've been up and down your timeline, meeting all those silly people who died to keep you alive. And you know what I worked out? What you really need.
DOCTOR: For what?
MISSY: To know that you're just like me!
MISSY: Oh, and now it begins. Doctor, I do believe you're on call. Miss Oswald expects. Who else but the girl who's got your number? Whoops!
DOCTOR: It was you!
CLARA : Ah, hello.
DOCTOR 11 : Where did you get this number?
CLARA : The woman in the shop wrote it down. It's a helpline, isn't it?
MISSY:  Computer helpline, love. That's the one. Best helpline in the universe.
DOCTOR: You put us together.
MISSY: I kept you together.
CLARA : Who put that advert in the paper?
DOCTOR : Who gave you my number?
CLARA : The woman. The woman in the shop.
DOCTOR : Then there's a woman out there who's very keen that we stay together.
DOCTOR: Why?
MISSY: Cos she's perfect, innit? The control freak and the man who should never be controlled. You'd go to hell if she asked. And she would. The phone's ringing, Doctor. Can you hear that? Now that is the sound of your chain being yanked. Heel, Doctor!  Help me, Doctor. Help me. Help me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Clara?
CLARA: Doctor. With Danny.
DOCTOR: Danny's dead, Clara.
CLARA : Not yet.
CLARA: Not quite. But he wants to be.
DOCTOR : Clara 
DOCTOR: Clara?
CLARA: He's a Cyberman.
CLARA : Doctor, Danny's a Cyberman.
CLARA: And he's crying. Doctor, he feels it. He's crying.
KATE: Message to Geneva. Tell them Boat One is going down. We don't anticipate survivors.
DOCTOR: Clara, don't do it. Just don't do it!
CLARA: It's in his chest. He says it's an inhibitor. It can delete emotion or something.
DOCTOR: I know what it does. If you turn it on
DOCTOR : He'll become a Cyberman.
CLARA: He's already a Cyberman.
DOCTOR: Not yet, he isn't.
CLARA: He's hurting because I hurt him and he wants it to stop.
DOCTOR : Stop the pain and he'll kill you!
CLARA: Look, are you going to help me, because I can't do this alone.
DOCTOR: I'm not going to help you commit suicide.
CLARA: Look, the Tardis can home in on this call, right? Either you help me, or you leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara, no  
CLARA: There's a lot of switches round the edge. I'm just going to try pressing them all.
CYBER-DANNY: Okay.
CLARA: I am so sorry.
CYBER-DANNY: Yeah.
KATE: Doctor! The Cybermen are in. The plane's going down.
MISSY: Oh, great. It's the daughter one. Do you like her? I like her.
KATE: Aaaaaargh!
DOCTOR: Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that!
MISSY: Oh, don't be so selfish. I'm going to miss her, too. In fact, you know what? Just for that, I'm leaving. Boys, blow up this plane and, I don't know, Belgium, yeah? Kill some Belgians. Might as well. They're not even French. Byeeee!
DOCTOR: Aaah! Aaah!
DOCTOR: Argh! Argh!
MISSY: Well, that's very boring. Oh, he's just going to squish. What kind of a way is that to die? That man has no finesse, none.
SEB: Well, it's quite dramatic.
MISSY: You're an AI interface. Kindly delete your opinions, thank you.
SEB: W-w-what's he doing? Is he? Is he? Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no. N-now, that's
SEB: Oh! Permission to squeeeee
CLARA: Two more to go. Does it feel any different?
CYBER-DANNY: No.
CLARA: Are you sure?
CYBER-DANNY: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Clara, don't!
CLARA: Help me.
DOCTOR: If you do what you're trying to do, if you succeed, he will snap you.
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: Then he will step over your broken body and break another and another and another. He will never stop.
CYBER-DANNY: I will not harm her.
DOCTOR: P E. P E. P E.
CYBER-DANNY: Sir.
DOCTOR: I had a friend once. We ran together when I was little. And I thought we were the same. But when we grew up, we weren't. Now, she's trying to tear the world apart, and I can't run fast enough to hold it together. The difference is this.
DOCTOR: Pain is a gift. Without the capacity for pain, we can't feel the hurt we inflict.
CYBER-DANNY: Are you telling me seriously, for real, that you can?
DOCTOR: Of course I can.
CYBER-DANNY: Then shame on you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: Danny, Danny, I need you to tell me. What are the clouds going to do? What is the plan?
CYBER-DANNY: How would I know?
DOCTOR: You're part of a hive mind now. Presumably that's how you found Clara. Just look.
CYBER-DANNY: I can't see much.
DOCTOR: Look harder.
CYBER-DANNY: Clara, watch this. This is who the Doctor is. Watch the blood-soaked old general in action. I can't see properly, sir, because this needs activating. If you want to know what's coming, you have to switch it on. And didn't all of those beautiful speeches just disappear in the face of a tactical advantage? Sir.
DOCTOR:  I need to know. I need to know.
CYBER-DANNY:  Yes.  Yes, you do.
CLARA: Give me the screwdriver.
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Just do it, Doctor. Do as you are told.
CYBER-DANNY: Typical officer. Got to keep those hands clean.
CLARA: Just point and think, yeah?
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: Okay. I wasn't very good at it, but I did love you.
CYBER-DANNY: I love you too.
CLARA: I'm never going to say that again.
CYBER-DANNY: Me neither.
CLARA: Ready?
CYBER-DANNY: Yeah.
CLARA: I feel like I'm killing you.
CYBER-DANNY: I'm already dead. You're here this time at least.
CLARA: Goodbye, Danny.
CYBER-DANNY: Goodbye, Clara.
DOCTOR: Clara, no! Step away! He's activating! Clara, step away now! Don't. Danny. Danny, if you can hear me, if you're still there, what are the clouds going to do?
CYBER-DANNY: The rain will fall again. All humanity will die.
DOCTOR: And rise again as Cybermen.
CYBER-DANNY: Correct.
DOCTOR: How do we stop it?
CYBER-DANNY: We cannot be stopped.
MISSY: Oh, that was brilliant! Oh, I love the telly here, but did you see that? Oh, Clara, you poor thing. You must feel like death. Let me pop away the pain.
DOCTOR: Don't you dare! Don't you think about it!
MISSY: Oh, sorry, hon, I'm just getting a bit carried away. It's your friends, they're so more-ish. Hmm?
MISSY: Oh, stop looking all cross-pants. I'm here to give you a gift. Could you at least try and be excited?
DOCTOR: What gift?
MISSY: Cyberdears!
MISSY: Look at Mummy! Raise your arms. Lower your arms. Raise your right. Lower your right. Turn on the spot. There are exits at the front and rear of the aircraft. Please follow the lights up the aisle. You see, Doctor? The power to slaughter whole worlds at a time, then make them do a safety briefing. Everyone who ever lived, man, woman and child, is now at my command. An indestructible army to rage across the universe. The more they kill, the more they recruit. Happy birthday. Oh! You didn't know, did you? It's lucky one of us remembers these things. Happy birthday  Mister President.
CYBERMAN: Doctor.
MISSY: Tiny bit pleased? Oh, go on, crack a smile. I want to see if your eyebrows drop off.
DOCTOR: All of this. All of it, just to give me an army?
MISSY: Well, I don't need one, do I? Armies are for people who think they're right. And nobody thinks they're righter than you. Give a good man firepower, and he'll never run out of people to kill.
DOCTOR: I don't want an army!
MISSY: Well, that's the trouble! Yes, you do! You've always wanted one! All those people suffering in the Dalek camps? Now you can save them. All those bad guys winning all the wars? Go and get the good guys back.
DOCTOR: Nobody can have that power.
MISSY: You will, because you don't have a choice. There's only way you can stop these clouds from opening up and killing all your little pets down here. Conquer the universe, Mister President. Show a bad girl how it's done.
DOCTOR: Why are you doing this?
MISSY: I need you to know we're not so different. I need my friend back. Every battle, every war, every invasion. From now on, you decide the outcome. What's the matter, Mister President? Don't you trust yourself?
DOCTOR : Tell me. Am I a good man?
DANNY :  Sir!
RUSTY : I see into your soul, Doctor. I see hatred.
DOCTOR :  I'm not a hero.
DALEK : You are a good Dalek.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: I really didn't know. I wasn't sure. You lose sight sometimes. Thank you! I am not a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am? I am an idiot, with a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through, helping out, learning. I don't need an army. I never have, because I've got them. Always them. Because love, it's not an emotion. Love is a promise.
DOCTOR: And he will never hurt her. P E, catch!  
DOCTOR: You didn't notice, did you? While you were doing all your silly orders, while you where showing off, the one soldier not obeying.
MISSY: No, that's wrong. That's impossible.
CYBER-DANNY: The rain will not fall.
MISSY: Oh? Why won't it?
CYBER-DANNY: The clouds will burn.
MISSY: And who'll burn them?
CYBER-DANNY: I will burn them.
MISSY: How?
CYBER-DANNY: I will burn.
MISSY: One burning Cyberman is hardly going to save the planet.
CYBER-DANNY: Correct.
CYBER-DANNY: Attention!
CYBER-DANNY: This is not a good day. This is Earth's darkest hour. And look at you miserable lot. We are the Fallen. But today, we shall rise. The army of the dead will save the land of the living. This is not the order of a general, nor the whim of a lunatic.
MISSY: Excuse me?
CYBER-DANNY: This is a promise. The promise of a soldier!  You will sleep safe tonight.
CLARA: Well. The clouds have all gone.
DOCTOR: Yes, burned up. Totally burnt. Burnt to nothing. Sorry.
MISSY: Ten zero eleven, zero zero by zero two
DOCTOR: What did you say??
MISSY: The current coordinates of Gallifrey. It's returned to it's original location. Didn't you ever think to look?
DOCTOR: You are lying!
MISSY: We can, we can go together, just you and me. Just like the old days.
DOCTOR: You'd be clapped in irons.
MISSY: If you like.
CLARA: Doctor, I'm assuming you'll remember those coordinates?
DOCTOR: No. No, don't you dare. I won't let you.
CLARA: Old friend, is she? If you have ever let this creature live, everything that happened today, is on you. All of it, on you. And you're not going to let her live again.
DOCTOR: Clara, all I'm doing is not letting you kill her. I never said I was letting her live.
CLARA: Really?
DOCTOR: If that's the only thing that will stop you, yes.
MISSY: Seriously. Oh, Doctor. To save her soul? But who, my dear, will save yours? Say something nice. Please?
DOCTOR: You win.
MISSY: I know.
CLARA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Kate. She's breathing! She's alive! She can't be here.
CLARA: She is.
DOCTOR: She fell out of a plane. The Cyberman must have caught her.
CLARA: Doctor, she's talking about her dad.
DOCTOR: Of course. The Earth's darkest hour and mine. Where else would you be?
DOCTOR:  Thank you.
DANNY : Clara. Clara.
CLARA: Danny? Danny? Is that you?
CLARA: Please say it's you.
DANNY : Clara.
CLARA: The Doctor told me about the bracelet, how it can let Missy travel from one world to the other.
DANNY : This place is dying now.
CLARA: Yes, but the bracelet can bring you home.
DANNY : There's only enough power for one trip.
CLARA: Then come on. Hurry up!
DANNY : Just one trip. One trip, one person.
CLARA: Danny!
DANNY : You need to find his parents. He died a long time ago.
DANNY : I'm sorry, Clara.  I truly am. I had, I had promises to keep.
DOCTOR: Hey.
CLARA: Hey.
DOCTOR: I got your message.
CLARA: Two weeks late.
DOCTOR: Not bad.
CLARA: Improving.
DOCTOR: I see you've got news for me.
CLARA: News?
DOCTOR: He figured it out then? P E figured out there was a way home.
CLARA: Yeah. Yeah, he did.
DOCTOR: Oh, good old P E. He'll make a maths teacher yet.
CLARA: Listen, Doctor. There's, there's something that I have to tell you and, er, it's not good news so just, just listen, okay?
DOCTOR: I know.
CLARA: Sorry?
DOCTOR: I know exactly what you've got to tell me.
CLARA: You do?
DOCTOR: You and Danny are together now. That's great. That's how it should be. But the old man and the blue box, that's never going to fit in. So no more flying around. No more lying.
CLARA: Okay, no, that's not exactly
DOCTOR: It's fine.
CLARA: No, it's not fine. It, it really isn't fine.
DOCTOR: I've found Gallifrey.
CLARA: Wow! Oh, my God,
DOCTOR: I entered the coordinates, just like she said. And I found Gallifrey. For once, she wasn't lying.
CLARA: So, what are you going to do now?
DOCTOR: Go home.
CLARA: Okay.
DOCTOR: Gallifrey can be a good place. I can help make it that.
CLARA: What, you?
DOCTOR: Shut up!
CLARA: You won't just steal a Tardis and run away?
DOCTOR: No, not this time. Never again.
CLARA: Never again.
DOCTOR: It's a long commute, so, you know, I thought, with you and Danny
CLARA: Yeah. Me and Danny. Me and Danny, we are going to be fine. Don't you worry. You go home. Go home. Go be a king or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I might do that.
CLARA: Or queen, you know. Whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah, queen, that would be good too.
CLARA: Yeah.  Tell you what, seeing as it's goodbye, shall we break a habit?
DOCTOR: What? What habit?
CLARA: Hug.
DOCTOR: Why not. Within reason.
DOCTOR: Come on, you're on the clock.
CLARA: Fair enough.
CLARA: Why don't you like hugging, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Never trust a hug. It's just a way to hide your face.
CLARA: Yeah.
CLARA: Doctor? Travelling with you made me feel really special. Thank you for that. Thank you for making me feel special.
DOCTOR: Thank you for exactly the same.
MAN : Coo-ee! Hello? Doctor? You know it can't end like that. Hmm? We need to get this sorted and quickly. She's not all right, you know. And neither are you. I'm coming in.
MAN : Ah, there you are. I knew I'd get round to you eventually. Now, stop gawping, and tell me.
SANTA: What do you want for Christmas?
