Human Nature
DOCTOR: Get down!
DOCTOR: Did they see you?
MARTHA: I don't know.
DOCTOR: But did they see you?
MARTHA: I don't know. I was too busy running.
DOCTOR: Martha, it's important. Did they see your face?
MARTHA: No, they couldn't have.
DOCTOR: Off we go!
DOCTOR: Argh! They're following us.
MARTHA: How can they do that? You've got a time machine.
DOCTOR: Stolen technology. They've got a Time Agent's vortex manipulator. They can follow us wherever we go, right across the universe. They're never going to stop, unless. I'll have to do it. Martha, you trust me, don't you?
MARTHA: Of course I do.
DOCTOR: Because it all depends on you.
MARTHA: What does? What am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: Take this watch, because my life depends on it. This watch, Martha. The watch is
DOCTOR: Come in.
MARTHA: Pardon me, Mister Smith. You're not dressed yet. I can come back later.
DOCTOR: No, it's all right, it's all right. Put it down. I was er. Sorry, sorry. Sometimes I have these extraordinary dreams.
MARTHA: What about, sir?
DOCTOR: I dream I'm this adventurer. This daredevil, a madman. The Doctor, I'm called. And last night I dreamt that you were there, as my companion.
MARTHA: A teacher and a housemaid, sir? That's impossible.
DOCTOR: I'm a man from another world, though.
MARTHA: Well it can't be true because there's no such thing.
DOCTOR: This thing. The watch is
DOCTOR: Ah, it's funny how dreams slip away. But I do remember one thing; it all took place in the future. In the Year of Our Lord two thousand and seven.
MARTHA: I can prove that wrong for you, sir. Here's the morning paper. It's Monday, November tenth, nineteen thirteen, and you're completely human, sir. As human as they come.
DOCTOR: Mmm, that's me. Completely human.
BOY 1: Morning, sir.
BOY: Morning, sir.
DOCTOR: Headmaster.
DOCTOR: Advanced with little impediment. The French were all but spent, with only two battalions of the old guard remaining. A final reserve force was charged with protecting Napoleon, but by evening, the advance of the Allied troops had forced them to retreat.
MARTHA: Morning, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes, hi.
JENNY: Head in the clouds, that one. Don't know why you're so sweet on him.
MARTHA: He's just kind to me, that's all. Not everyone's that considerate, what with me being
JENNY: A Londoner?
MARTHA: Exactly. Good old London town.
BAINES: Er, now then, you two. You're not paid to have fun, are you? Put a little backbone into it.
JENNY: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
HUTCHINSON: You there, what's your name again?
MARTHA: Martha, sir. Martha Jones.
HUTCHINSON: Tell me then, Jones. With hands like those, how can you tell when something's clean?
MARTHA: That's very funny, sir.
JENNY: Careful, now. Don't answer back.
MARTHA: I'd answer back with my bucket over his head.
JENNY: Oh, I wish. Just think, though. In a few years time, boys like that'll be running the country.
MARTHA: Nineteen thirteen. They might not.
BOY: Excuse me, ma'am.
JOAN: Oh, good morning, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: There we go.
JOAN: Let me help you.
DOCTOR: No, no, I've got it, no. Er, how best to retrieve? Tell you what. If you could take these
JOAN: Good.
DOCTOR: No harm done. So, er, how was Jenkins?
JOAN: Oh just a cold. Nothing serious. I think he's missing his mother more than anything.
DOCTOR: Oh, we can't have that.
JOAN: He received a letter this morning, so he's a lot more chipper. I appear to be holding your books.
DOCTOR: Yes, so you are. Sorry, sorry. Just let me.
JOAN: No, why don't I take half?
DOCTOR: Ah, brilliant idea. Brilliant. Perfect. Division of labour.
JOAN: We make quite a team.
DOCTOR: Don't we just.
JOAN: So, these books. Were they being taken in any particular direction?
DOCTOR: Yes. This way.
DOCTOR: I always say, Matron, give the boys a good head of steam, they'll soon wear themselves out.
JOAN: Truth be told, when it's just you and me, I'd much rather you call me Nurse Redfern. Matron sounds rather well, matronly.
DOCTOR: Ah. Nurse Redfern it is then.
JOAN: Though we've known each other all of two months, you could even say Joan.
DOCTOR: Joan?
JOAN: That's my name.
DOCTOR: Well, obviously.
JOAN: And it's John, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it is, yes.
JOAN: Have you seen this, John? The annual dance at the village hall tomorrow. It's nothing formal, but rather fun by all accounts. Do you think you'll go?
DOCTOR: I hadn't thought about it.
JOAN: It's been ages since I've been to a dance, only no one's asked me.
DOCTOR: Well, I should imagine that you'd be, er, I mean, I never thought you'd be one for. I mean, there's no reason why you shouldn't. If you do, you may not. I, I probably won't, but even if I did then I couldn't. I mean I wouldn't want to
JOAN: The stairs.
DOCTOR: What about the stairs?
JOAN: They're right behind you.
JOAN: Stop it. I get boys causing less fuss than this.
DOCTOR: Because it hurts.
MARTHA: Is he all right?
JOAN: Excuse me, Martha. It's hardly good form to enter a master's study without knocking.
MARTHA: Sorry. Right. Yeah.
MARTHA: But is he all right? They said you fell down the stairs, Sir.
DOCTOR: No, it was just a tumble, that's all.
MARTHA: Have you checked for concussion?
JOAN: I have. And I daresay I know a lot more about it than you.
MARTHA: Sorry. I'll just tidy your things.
DOCTOR: I was just telling Nurse Redfern, Matron, about my dreams. They are quite remarkable tales. I keep imagining that I'm someone else, and that I'm hiding.
JOAN: Hiding? In what way?
DOCTOR: They're almost every night. This is going to sound silly.
JOAN: Tell me.
DOCTOR: I dream, quite often, that I have two hearts.
JOAN: Well, then. I can be the judge of that. Let's find out.
JOAN: I can confirm the diagnosis. Just one heart, singular.
DOCTOR: I have er, I have written down some of these dreams in the form of fiction. Not that it would be of any interest.
JOAN: I'd be very interested.
DOCTOR: Well, I've never actually shown it to anyone before.
JOAN: A Journal of Impossible Things.
JOAN: Just look at these creatures.
JOAN: Such imagination.
DOCTOR: It's become quite a hobby.
JOAN: It's wonderful. And quite an eye for the pretty girls.
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, she's just an invention. This character, Rose. I call her, Rose. Seems to disappear later on.
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the box. The blue box. It's always there. Like a like a magic carpet. This funny little box that transports me to far away places.
JOAN: Like a doorway?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
DOCTOR: I sometimes think how magical life would be if stories like this were true.
JOAN: If only.
DOCTOR: It's just a dream.
MARTHA: Ma'am? That book.
JOAN: Oh, I'll look after it. Don't worry. He did say I could read it.
MARTHA: But it's silly, that's all. Just stories.
JOAN: Who is he, Martha?
MARTHA: I'm sorry?
JOAN: It's like he's left the kettle on. Like he knows he has something to get back to, but he can't remember what.
MARTHA: That's just him.
JOAN: You arrived with him, didn't you? He found you employment here at the school, isn't that right?
MARTHA: I used to work for the family. He just sort of inherited me.
JOAN: Well, I'd be careful. If you don't mind my saying, you sometimes seem a little familiar with him. Best remember your position.
MARTHA: Yes, ma'am.
HUTCHINSON: Ah, Latimer. Here you are, Latin translation.
HUTCHINSON: Blasted Catullus. I want it done by morning.
LATIMER: Yes, sir.
HUTCHINSON: And no mistakes. I want it written by best handwriting.
HUTCHINSON: Listen, Father says he's been promoted. That means more money. Might end up in a better school.
LATIMER: Ah, he should enjoy it, sir. My uncle had a six month posting in Johannesburg. Says it was the most beautiful countryside on God's Earth.
HUTCHINSON: What are you talking about?
LATIMER: Africa. Your father.
HUTCHINSON: You been reading my post?
LATIMER: What?
HUTCHINSON: You said Africa. I've only just read the word myself. How did you know that?
LATIMER: I haven't.
HUTCHINSON: Have you been spying on me?
LATIMER: No. I just guessed.
HUTCHINSON: What's that supposed to mean?
LATIMER: I'm good at guessing, that's all.
HUTCHINSON: Idiot.
LATIMER: Sometimes I say things and they turn out to be correct. Just little things. Tiny things. I can't help it. It's just some sort of luck.
BAINES: Right, well, never mind that little toad. Who's for beer?
HUTCHINSON: You've got beer?
BAINES: No, but Baxter's hidden a secret supply in Blackdown woods.
HUTCHINSON: What are you waiting for?
HUTCHINSON: Make sure the Bursar's down the pub before you go past his window.
BAINES: A bottle for everyone, is it?
HUTCHINSON: And none for the filth. And hurry back, Baines, I'm parched.
MARTHA: Ooo, it's freezing out here. Why can't we have a drink inside the pub?
JENNY: Now don't be ridiculous. You do get these notions! It's all very well, those Suffragettes. but that's London. That's miles away.
MARTHA: But don't you just want to scream sometimes, having to bow and scrape and behave. Don't you just want to tell them?
JENNY: I don't know. Things must be different in your country.
MARTHA: Yeah, well they are. Thank God I'm not staying.
JENNY: You keep saying that.
MARTHA: Just you wait. One more month and I'm as free as the wind. I wish you could come with me, Jenny. You'd love it.
JENNY: Where are you going to go?
MARTHA: Anywhere. Just look up there. Imagine you could go all the way out to the stars.
JENNY: You don't half say mad things.
MARTHA: That's where I'm going. Into the sky, all the way out.
MARTHA: Did you see that?
JENNY: See what?
MARTHA: Did you see it, though? Right up there, just for a second.
JENNY: Martha, there's nothing there.
MARTHA: Matron, are you all right?
JOAN: Did you see that? There was something in the woods. This light.
DOCTOR: Anything wrong, ladies? Far too cold to be standing around in the dark, don't you.
JOAN: There, there. Look in the sky.
JENNY: Oh, that's beautiful.
DOCTOR: All gone. Commonly known as a meteorite. It's just rocks falling to the ground, that's all.
JOAN: It came down in the woods.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. No, they always look close, when actually they're miles off. Nothing left but a cinder. Now, I should escort you back to the school. Ladies?
MARTHA: No, we're fine, thanks.
DOCTOR: Then I shall bid you goodnight.
MARTHA: Jenny, where was that? On the horizon, where the light was headed.
JENNY: That's by Cooper's Field.
JENNY: You can't just run off. It's dark. You'll break a leg.
BAINES: I say, hello? Was that some kind of aeroplane? You chaps all right?
BAINES: What? That's, that's impossible.
BAINES: Some kind of door. Hello? Is anyone there?
JENNY: There you are. Nothing there. I told you so.
MARTHA: And that's Cooper's Field?
JENNY: As far as the eye can see, and no falling star. Now come on, I'm frozen to the bone, let's go. As your Mister Smith says, nothing to see.
BAINES: But I don't understand. Who are you?
FATHER : We are the Family.
MOTHER : Far more important, who are you, little thing?
BAINES: My name's Baines. Jeremy Baines. Please can I go?
MOTHER : I'm so sorry, Baines Jeremy Baines, but I don't think you can ever leave.
BAINES: But, who are you? Why can't I see you?
FATHER : Why would you want to see us?
BAINES: I want to know what you look like.
MOTHER : Oh, that's easily answered, because very soon we will look so familiar.
HUTCHINSON: Where is he? Promises us beer then vanishes into the night.
HUTCHINSON: There he is. Let him in.
HUTCHINSON: Baines, you dolt. I thought you'd been caught by the rozzers. Well, then? Where is it, man? Where's the blessed beer?
BAINES: There was no beer. It was gone.
HUTCHINSON: Damn it all, I've been waiting. Pretty poor show, Baines, I have to say. What's the matter with you? Caught sniffles out there?
BAINES: Yes, I must have. It was cold. Very cold.
HUTCHINSON: Well, don't spread it about, I don't want your germs. Come on, might as well get some sleep. Come on, chaps. Maybe tomorrow. Jackson's got some beer in the pavilion.
MARTHA: Hello. I'm talking to a machine
DOCTOR: Get down! They're following us. They can follow us wherever we go. Right across the universe. They're never going to stop. Martha, you trust me, don't you?
MARTHA: Of course I do.
DOCTOR: Because it all depends on you. Martha, this watch is me.
MARTHA: Right, okay, gotcha. No, hold on. Completely lost.
DOCTOR: Those creatures are hunters. They can sniff out anyone, and me being a Time Lord, well, I'm unique. They can track me down across the whole of time and space.
MARTHA: Huh. And the good news is?
DOCTOR: They can smell me, they haven't seen me. And their life span'll be running out, so we hide. Wait for them to die.
MARTHA: But they can track us down.
DOCTOR: That's why I've got to do it. I have to stop being a Time Lord. I'm going to become human.
DOCTOR: Never thought I'd use this. All the times I've wondered.
MARTHA: What does it do?
DOCTOR: Chameleon Arch. Rewrites my biology. Literally changes every single cell in my body. I've set it to human.
DOCTOR: Now, the Tardis will take care of everything. Invent a life story for me, find me a setting and integrate me. Can't do the same for you. You'll just have to improvise. I should have just enough residual awareness to let you in.
MARTHA: But, hold on. If you're going to rewrite every single cell, isn't it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah. It hurts.
DOCTOR : This working? Martha, before I change, here's a list of instructions for when I'm human. One, don't let me hurt anyone. We can't have that, but you know what humans are like. Two, don't worry about the Tardis. I'll put it on emergency power so they can't detect it. Just let it hide away. Four. No, wait a minute, three. No getting involved in big historical events. Four, you. Don't let me abandon you. And fi 
MARTHA: But there was a meteor, a shooting star. What am I supposed to do then?
DOCTOR : And twenty three. If anything goes wrong, if they find us, Martha, then you know what to do. Open the watch. Everything I am is kept safe in there. Now, I've put a perception filter on it so the human me won't think anything of it. To him, it's just a watch. But don't open it unless you have to. Because once it's open, then the Family will be able to find me. It's all down to you, Martha. Your choice. Oh, and thank you.
MARTHA: I wish you'd come back.
LATIMER: You told me to come and collect that book, sir.
DOCTOR: Good lad. Yes. Yes! The Definitive Account of Mafeking by Aitchison Price. Where did I put it? And I wanted a little word. Your marks aren't quite good enough.
LATIMER: I'm top ten in my class, sir.
DOCTOR: Now, be honest, Timothy, you should be the very top. You're a clever boy. You seem to be hiding it. Where is that book? And I know why. Keeping your head low avoids the mockery of your classmates. But no man should hide himself, don't you think?
LATIMER: Yes, sir.
DOCTOR : You're clever. Be proud of it. Use it.
MOTHER : Time Lord. Hide yourself.
DOCTOR : The secret lies within. I'm trapped. I'm kept inside the cogs.
DOCTOR : In the dark, waiting. Always waiting.
DOCTOR: Fascinating details about the siege. Really quite remarkable. Are you all right?
LATIMER: Yes, sir. Fine, sir.
DOCTOR: Right then. Good. And remember. Use that brain of yours.
DOCTOR : Power of a Time Lord.
DOCTOR: You're really not looking yourself, old chap. Anything bothering you?
LATIMER: No, sir Thank you, sir.
 
DOCTOR : You are not alone. Keep me hidden.
VOICES : And infinite fire. Burn with light. Burn in time.
PHILIPS: Cut along. Classes are starting now. Come along, Jenkins.
BAINES : There is a trace, but somehow scattered. The scent is confused. Nevertheless, we'd best arm ourselves.
BAINES: Activate the soldiers.
CLARK: That is my property, and you're trespassing on my land. Come on, who's in there? One of those idiot boys from the school, is it, eh? Come on, let's
CLARK: But how did you
DOCTOR: Concentrate.
DOCTOR: Hutchinson, excellent work.
ROCASTLE: Cease fire!
DOCTOR: Good day to you, Headmaster.
ROCASTLE: Your crew's on fine form today, Mister Smith.
HUTCHINSON: Excuse me, Headmaster. We could do a lot better. Latimer's being deliberately shoddy.
LATIMER: I'm trying my best.
ROCASTLE: You need to be better than the best. Those targets are tribesmen from the dark continent.
LATIMER: That's exactly the problem, sir. They only have spears.
ROCASTLE: Oh, dear me. Latimer takes it upon himself to make us realise how wrong we all are. I hope, Latimer, that one day you may have a just and proper war in which to prove yourself. Now, resume firing.
MAN : Mind the wire. Keep your heads down!
LATIMER: One minute past the hour. It's now. Hutchinson, this is the time. It's now.
HUTCHINSON: Stoppage. Immediate action. Didn't I tell you, sir? This stupid boy is useless. Permission to give Latimer a beating, sir.
ROCASTLE: It's your class, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: Permission granted.
HUTCHINSON: Right. Come with me, you little oik.
DOCTOR: Anything the matter, Baines?
BAINES: I thought. No, sir. Nothing, sir.
ROCASTLE: As you were, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: Ah, Pemberton, Smythe, Wicks, take post.
DOCTOR: Ah, Nurse Redfern.
JOAN: Er, I'll give you back your journal when next I see you.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. You don't have to.
JOAN: If you'll excuse me, Mister Smith. I was just thinking about the day my husband was shot.
JOAN: His name was Oliver. He died in the battle of Spion Cop. We were childhood sweethearts. But you see, I was angry with the army for such a long time.
DOCTOR: You still are.
JOAN: I find myself as part of that school watching boys learn how to kill.
DOCTOR: Don't you think discipline is good for them?
JOAN: Does it have to be such military discipline? I mean, if there's another war those boys won't find it so amusing.
DOCTOR: Well, Great Britain is at peace, long may it reign.
JOAN: In your journal, in one of your stories, you wrote about next year. Nineteen fourteen.
DOCTOR: That was just a dream.
JOAN: All those images of mud and wire. You told of a shadow. A shadow falling across the entire world.
DOCTOR: Well then, we can be thankful it's not true. And I'll admit mankind doesn't need warfare and bloodshed to prove itself. Everyday life can provide honour and valour, and let's hope that from now on this, this country can find its heroes in smaller places.
DOCTOR: In the most
DOCTOR: Ordinary of, of deeds.
WORKMAN: Are you all right? How's the little one?
DOCTOR: Lucky.
JOAN: That was luck?
DOCTOR: Nurse Redfern, might I invite you to the village dance this evening, as my guest?
JOAN: You extraordinary man.
JOAN: Oh, it's all becoming clear now. The Doctor is the man you'd like to be, doing impossible things with cricket balls.
DOCTOR: Well, I discovered a talent, that's certainly true.
JOAN: But the Doctor has an eye for the ladies.
DOCTOR: The devil.
JOAN: A girl at every fireplace.
DOCTOR: Ah, now, there I have to protest, Joan. That is hardly me.
JOAN: Says the man dancing with me tonight.
DOCTOR: That scarecrow's all skewed.
JOAN: Ever the artist. Where did you learn to draw?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey.
JOAN: Is that in Ireland?
DOCTOR: Yes, it must be, yes.
JOAN: But you're not Irish?
DOCTOR: Not at all, no. My father Sidney was a watchmaker from Nottingham, and my mother Verity was, er. Well, she was a nurse, actually.
JOAN: Oh. We make such good wives.
DOCTOR: Really? Right. Yes. Well, my work is done. What do you think?
JOAN: Masterpiece.
DOCTOR: All sorts of skills today!
JOAN: Can I see?
JOAN: Oh, goodness Do I look like that? Are you sure that's not me?
DOCTOR: Most definitely this page. Do you like it?
JOAN: You've made me far too beautiful.
DOCTOR: Well, that's how I see you.
JOAN: Widows aren't supposed to be beautiful. I think the world would rather we stopped. Is that fair? That we stop?
DOCTOR: That's not fair at all.
DOCTOR: I've never er
DOCTOR: Martha, what have I told you about entering unannounced?
MARTHA: That wasn't on the list.
DOCTOR : Four. You. Don't let me abandon you.
MARTHA: That's no good. What about the stuff you didn't tell me? What about women? Oh no, you didn't think of that. What in hell am I supposed to do then?
DOCTOR : Thank you.
MARTHA: You had to, didn't you? You had to go and fall in love with a human, and it wasn't me.
WOMAN : Darkness is coming. 
DOCTOR : Keep me away from the false and empty man. 
MAN : The last of the Time Lords. The last of that wise and ancient race. 
WOMAN : Merge with the faces of men.
JENNY: Who's that playing silly beggars? Nearly broke me neck. Who's that, then? Is it you, Saul?
JENNY: I don't understand. It's Mister Clark, isn't it? What have I done wrong?
CLARK: Nothing at all. In fact, you're just what we need, girl.
BAINES: She works at the school, and whatever's happening seems to centred round that establishment. The faintest of traces, but they all lead back there.
JENNY: It's Baines, isn't it? This isn't very funny, sir.
BAINES: Just shut up. Stop talking. Cease and desist, there's a good girl! Mother of Mine is dying to meet you. And here she is.
JENNY: Stop mocking me, sir.
BAINES: No! Mother of Mine just needs a shape. We go through shapes so very fast. Yours is perfectly adequate, if a little grim. Mother of Mine, embrace her.
DOCTOR: You look wonderful.
JOAN: You'd best give me some warning. Er, can you actually dance?
DOCTOR: I'm not certain.
JOAN: There's a surprise. Is there anything you're certain about?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes.
MARTHA: There you are. Come and look what I've got. Mister Poole didn't want his afternoon tea so Cook said I could have it. And there's enough for two. What are you standing there for?
MARTHA: Are you all right?
JENNY: I must have a cold coming on.
MARTHA: The problem is, I keep thinking about them, but I don't know what to do.
JENNY: Thinking about who?
MARTHA: Mister Smith and Matron. Because it's never going to last. He's going to leave in a few weeks.
JENNY: Why?
MARTHA: It's like his contract comes to an end. And she's going to be heartbroken.
JENNY: Leave for where?
MARTHA: All sorts of places. I wish I could tell you, Jenny, but it's complicated.
JENNY: In what way?
MARTHA: I just can't.
JENNY: It sounds so interesting. Tell me. Tell me now.
MARTHA: Would you like some tea?
JENNY: Yes, thanks.
MARTHA: I could put a nice bit of gravy in the pot. And some mutton. Or sardines and jam. How about that?
JENNY: I like the sound of that.
MARTHA: Right. Hold on a tick.
MARTHA: They've found us.
JOAN: This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Martha, I've warned you.
MARTHA: They've found us, and I've seen them. They look like people, like us, like normal. I'm sorry, but you've got to open the watch. Where is it?
MARTHA: Oh, my God. Where's it gone? Where's the watch?
DOCTOR: What are you talking about?
MARTHA: You had a watch. A fob watch. Right there.
DOCTOR: Did I? I don't remember.
JOAN: I can't see what concern it is of yours.
MARTHA: But we need it. Oh, my God, Doctor, we're hiding from aliens, and they've got Jenny and they've possessed her or copied her or something, and you've got to tell me, where's the watch?
DOCTOR Oh, I see. Cultural differences. It must be so confusing for you. Martha, this is what we call a story.
MARTHA: Oh you complete. This is not you. This is nineteen thirteen.
DOCTOR: Good. This is nineteen thirteen.
MARTHA: I've sorry. I'm really sorry, but I've got to snap you out of this.
JOAN: Martha!
MARTHA: Wake up! You're coming back to the Tardis with me.
DOCTOR: How dare, how dare you. I'm not going anywhere with an insane servant. Martha, you are dismissed. You will leave these premises immediately. Now get out!
DOCTOR: The nerve of it. The absolute cheek. You think I'm a fantasist? What about her?
JOAN: The funny thing is, you did have a fob watch, right there. Don't you remember?
MARTHA: Oh, sorry!
MARTHA: Sorry.
LATIMER: Martha?
MARTHA: Not now, Tim. Busy!
BAINES: Mister Smith? No one home.
JENNY: The maid was definitely hiding something. A secret around this Mister Smith.
BAINES: We both scented him, though. He was plain and simple human.
JENNY: Maybe he knows something. Where is he?
JOAN: She's infatuated. You're a dangerous man.
DOCTOR: You've taken my arm in public.
JOAN: I'm very scared.
BEGGAR: Spare a penny for the veterans of the Crimea, sir?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. There you are.
CHAMBERS: Ladies and gentlemen. Please take your partners for a waltz.
JOAN: You can dance.
DOCTOR: I surprise myself.
DOCTOR: Sorry.
CLARK: I think this might help.
JENNY: That makes it easy, Son of Mine. Because Daughter of Mine's already there.
BAINES: We've been invited to the dance.
BEGGAR: Oh, staff entrance, I think, Miss.
MARTHA: Yeah? Well, think again, mate.
JOAN: Please, don't. Not again.
MARTHA: He's different from any other man you've ever met, right?
JOAN: Yes.
MARTHA: And sometimes he says these strange things, like people and places you've never heard of, yeah? But it's deeper than that. Sometimes when you look in his eyes you know, you just know that there's something else in there. Something hidden. Right behind the eyes, something hidden away in the dark.
JOAN: I don't know what you mean.
MARTHA: Yes, you do. I don't mean to be rude, but the awful thing is it doesn't even matter what you think. But you're nice. And you're lucky. And I just wanted to say sorry for what I'm about to do.
DOCTOR: Oh, now really, Martha. This is getting out of hand. I must insist that you leave.
MARTHA: Do you know what this is? Name it. Go on, name it.
JOAN: John, what is that silly thing? John?
MARTHA: You're not John Smith. You're called the Doctor. The man in your journal, he's real. He's you.
BEGGAR: Evening, all. Spare a penny, sir?
BAINES: I didn't spare you.
CLARK: There will be silence! All of you!
CLARK: I said, silence!
CHAMBERS: Mister Clarke, what's going on?
MARTHA: Mister Smith? Everything I told you, just forget it! Don't say anything.
BAINES: We asked for silence! Now then, we have a few questions for Mister Smith.
LUCY: No, better than that. The teacher. He's the Doctor. I heard them talking.
BAINES: You took human form.
DOCTOR: Of course I'm human. I was born human, as were you, Baines. And Jenny, and you, Mister Clark. What is going on? This is madness.
BAINES: Ooo, and a human brain, too. Simple, thick and dull.
JENNY: But he's no good like this.
CLARK: We need a Time Lord.
BAINES: Easily done.
BAINES: Change back.
DOCTOR: I don't know what you're talking about.
BAINES: Change back!
