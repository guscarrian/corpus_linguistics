The Idiot's Lantern
ANNOUNCER : Orchestrations were arranged by Sir Rodney Fenning, and Dame Eve English is a member of the Kings Lynn Players. So tune in again next week for more from the What's My Line team. And that brings us to the end of programming for today. So, from all of us here at Alexandra Palace, a very good night.
MAGPIE: Two hundred pounds overdrawn. I need a miracle.
RITA: He's a caution, that one! He does make me laugh.
GRAN: Our lord and master.
EDDIE: Rita, I'm off out.
TOMMY: Dad.
EDDIE: Oh, how many times, son? We'll see.
TOMMY: But everyone's getting a telly, dad. Even Mister Gallagher, and the Bells at number sixty seven.
EDDIE: Well, perhaps we'll get one for the Coronation. If you're lucky. We'll see. Don't wait up.
GRAN: I heard they rot your brains. Rot them into soup, and your brain comes pouring out of your ears. That's what television does.
WIRE: Mister Magpie? Oh, Mister Magpie?
MAGPIE: Eh?
WIRE: Woo hoo! Can you hear me, Magpie?
MAGPIE: Yes. I must be dreaming
WIRE: Oh no, this isn't a dream.
MAGPIE: I'm going doolally, then.
WIRE : Not at all, sweetheart. Now, are you sitting comfortably? Good. Then we'll begin.
ROSE: I thought we'd be going for the Vegas era, you know the white flares and the, grr, chest hair.
DOCTOR: You are kidding, aren't you? You want to see Elvis, you go for the late fifties. The time before burgers. When they called him the Pelvis and he still had a waist. What's more, you see him in style.
DOCTOR: You going my way, doll?
ROSE: Is there any other way to go, daddy-o? Straight from the fridge, man.
DOCTOR: Hey, you speak the lingo.
ROSE: Oh well, me, mum, Cliff Richard movies every Bank Holiday Monday.
DOCTOR: Ah, Cliff. I knew your mother'd be a Cliff fan.
ROSE: Where we off to?
DOCTOR: Ed Sullivan TV Studios. Elvis did Hound Dog on one of the shows. There were loads of complaints. Bit of luck, we'll just catch it.
ROSE: And that'll be TV studios in, what, New York?
DOCTOR: That's the one.
ROSE: Ha! Digging that New York vibe.
DOCTOR: Well, this could still be New York. I mean, this looks very New York to me. Sort of Londony New York, mind.
ROSE: What are all the flags for?
ANNETTE MILLS :  We love Muffin, everybody sing. We want Muffin the Mule. Hello.
EDDIE: Smashing. Smashing, innit? You'd have thought they was in the room with you, eh? Fair do's Tommy, you had a point. New television. There, that should cheer you up a bit, Rita. Give us a smile, then, eh?
RITA: I can't. Nothing's the same any more, not with her
EDDIE: Stop going on about it.
RITA: But her face, Eddie. What happened to her? That awful face.
EDDIE: I said, stop it!
RITA: She's awake. I think she's hungry.
MAGPIE: There you go, sir, all wired up for the great occasion.
DOCTOR: The great occasion? What do you mean?
MAGPIE: Where've you been living, out in the Colonies? Coronation, of course.
DOCTOR: What Coronation's that then?
MAGPIE: What do you mean? The Coronation.
ROSE: It's the Queen's. Queen Elizabeth.
DOCTOR: Oh! Is this 1953?
MAGPIE: Last time I looked. Time for a lovely bit of pomp and circumstance, what we do best.
ROSE: Look at all the TV aerials. Looks like everyone's got one. That's weird. My nan said tellies were so rare they all had to pile into one house.
MAGPIE: Not around here, love. Magpie's Marvellous Tellies, only five quid a pop.
DOCTOR: Oh, but this is a brilliant year. Classic! Technicolour, Everest climbed, everything off the ration. The nation throwing off the shadows of war and looking forward to a happier, brighter future.
MRS GALLAGHER: Someone help me, please! Ted!
MRS GALLAGHER: Leave him alone! He's my husband! Please.
DOCTOR: What's going on?
TOMMY: Oi, what are you doing?
BISHOP: Police business. Now, get out of the way, sir.
ROSE: Who did they take? Do you know him?
TOMMY: Must be Mister Gallagher.
TOMMY: It's happening all over the place. They're turning into monsters.
EDDIE: Tommy! Not one word! Get inside now!
TOMMY: Sorry. I'd better do as he says
DOCTOR: All aboard!
BISHOP: Operation Market Stall, go, go, go!
DOCTOR: Lost them. How'd they get away from us?
ROSE: Surprised they didn't turn back and arrest you for reckless driving. Have you actually passed your test?
DOCTOR: Men in black? Vanishing police cars? This is Churchill's England, not Stalin's Russia.
ROSE: Monsters, that boy said. Maybe we should go and ask the neighbours.
DOCTOR: That's what I like about you. The domestic approach.
ROSE: Thank you. Hold on, was that an insult? Whoa!
MAGPIE: I've finished it, as you instructed.
WIRE: That's awfully good of you, Mister Magpie.
MAGPIE: So you'll go soon? You'll leave me?
WIRE: Oh, we'll see. If you're a very good boy.
MAGPIE: Please, you're burning me, inside, behind my eyes. It hurts. Even my memories hurt. I just want things back like they used to be.
WIRE: Oh, but this world of your is busy, busy, busy, forging ahead into a brand new age. You can never go back. That's your tragedy. But now, the time is almost ripe, Magpie. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Or lady.
TOMMY: Gran? Gran, it's me. It's Tommy. I'm going to come in, Gran. Stand back. Just don't. I'm sorry, but I've got to come in.
EDDIE: What do you think you're doing?
TOMMY: We've got to try and help her, dad.
EDDIE: Give me that key. I said give me that key, right now.
EDDIE: Don't think I've finished with you.
EDDIE: All the warnings I've given you, and every time, every time, you disobey me.
TOMMY: We can't just lock her away.
EDDIE: Excuse me, sunshine. I am talking. You can forget that college nonsense. You're going to come and work alongside me. Get your hands dirty for once.
RITA: Oh lord, won't she ever stop?
EDDIE: There, there, Rita, my sweet. Business as usual. Now let's get these up all over the house in honour of her Majesty.
RITA: But Eddie, what if she's dying?
EDDIE: I am talking! That's better. A little bit of hush.
DOCTOR + ROSE: Hi!
EDDIE: Who are you, then?
DOCTOR: Let's see, then. Judging by the look of you, family man, nice house, decent wage, fought in the war, therefore I represent Queen and country.
DOCTOR: Just doing a little check of Her forthcoming Majesty's subjects before the great day. Don't mind if I come in? Nah, I didn't think you did. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Not bad. Very nice. Very well kept. I'd like to congratulate you, Mrs?
RITA: Connolly.
EDDIE: Now then, Rita. I can handle this. This gentleman's a proper representative. Don't mind the wife, she rattles on a bit.
DOCTOR: Well, maybe she should rattle on a bit more. I'm not convinced you're doing your patriotic duty. Nice flags. Why are they not flying?
EDDIE: There we are Rita, I told you, Get them up. Queen and country.
RITA: I'm sorry.
EDDIE: Get it done. Do it now.
DOCTOR: Hold on a minute.
EDDIE: Like the gentleman says.
DOCTOR: Hold on a minute. You've got hands, Mister Connolly. Two big hands. So why is that your wife's job?
EDDIE: Well, it's housework, innit?
DOCTOR: And that's a woman's job?
EDDIE: Of course it is.
DOCTOR: Mister Connolly, what gender is the Queen?
EDDIE: She's a female.
DOCTOR: And are you suggesting the Queen does the housework?
EDDIE: No. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Then get busy.
EDDIE: Right. Yes, sir. You'll be proud of us, sir. We'll have Union Jacks left, right and centre.
ROSE: Excuse me, Mister Connolly. Hang on a minute. Union Jacks?
EDDIE: Yes, that's right, isn't it?
ROSE: That's the Union Flag. It's the Union Jack only when it's flown at sea.
EDDIE: Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, I do apologise.
ROSE: Well, don't get it wrong again, there's a good man. Now get to it!
DOCTOR: Right then! Nice and comfy, at Her Majesty's leisure. Union Flag?
ROSE: Mum went out with a sailor.
DOCTOR: Oh ho ho ho. I bet she did. Anyway, I'm the Doctor and this is Rose, and you are?
TOMMY: Tommy.
DOCTOR: Well, sit yourself down, Tommy. Have a look at this. I love telly, don't you?
TOMMY: Yeah, I think it's brilliant.
DOCTOR: Good man!
DOCTOR: Keep working, Mister C! Now, why don't you tell me what's wrong?
RITA: Did you say you were a doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am.
RITA: Can you help her? Oh please, can you help her, Doctor?
EDDIE: Now then, Rita. I don't think the gentleman needs to know
DOCTOR: No, the gentleman does.
ROSE: Tell us what's wrong, and we can help.
ROSE: I'm sorry. It's all right. Come here. It's okay.
EDDIE: Hold on a minute. Queen and country's one thing, but this is my house! What the?
EDDIE: What the hell am I doing? Now you listen here, Doctor. You may have fancy qualifications, but what goes on under my roof is my business.
DOCTOR: A lot of people are being bundled into
EDDIE: I am talking!
DOCTOR: And I'm not listening! Now you, Mister Connolly, you are staring into a deep, dark pit of trouble if you don't let me help. So I'm ordering you, sir! Tell me what's going on!
EDDIE: She won't stop. She never stops.
TOMMY: We started hearing stories, all round the place. People who've changed. Families keeping it secret because they were scared. Then the police started finding out. We don't know how, no one does. They just turn up, come to the door and take them, any time of the day or night.
DOCTOR: Show me.
TOMMY: Gran? It's Tommy. It's all right, Gran. I've brought help.
DOCTOR: Her face is completely gone.
 
DOCTOR: Scarcely an electrical impulse left. Almost complete neural shutdown. She's ticking over. It's like her brain has been wiped clean.
TOMMY: What're we going to do, Doctor? We can't even feed her.
ROSE: We've got company
RITA: It's them. They've come for her!
DOCTOR: Quickly. What was she doing before this happened? Where was she? Tell me. Quickly, think!
TOMMY: I can't think! She doesn't leave the house! She was just
DOCTOR: Hold on a minute. There are three important, brilliant, and complicated reasons why you should listen to me. One
ROSE: Doctor!
RITA: Leave her alone! No!
ROSE: Doctor!
RITA: Don't hurt her!
EDDIE: Back inside, Rita.
RITA: She's my mother.
EDDIE: Back inside now, I said.
DOCTOR: Ah, hell of a right hook. Have to watch out for that.
EDDIE: Don't fight it. Back inside.
DOCTOR: Rose, come on!
EDDIE: Get back inside!
TOMMY: But Dad, they took her!
EDDIE: Don't fight it, son. Don't fight it.
DOCTOR: Rose, we're going to lose them again!
TOMMY: Dad, they took her! That was Gran and they took her!
EDDIE: Come on, back inside, now.
TOMMY: Anyway, how did they find her? Who told them?
EDDIE: You! Get the hell out of my house!
ROSE: I'm going. I'm done. Nice to meet you, Tommy, Mrs Connolly. And as for you, Mister Connolly, only an idiot hangs the Union Flag upside down. Shame on you!
DOCTOR: Oh, very good. Very good.
BISHOP: Stay where you are.
MAGPIE: Oh, I'm sorry, Miss. I'm afraid you're too late. I was just about to lock the door.
ROSE: Yeah? Well, I want to buy a telly.
MAGPIE: Come back tomorrow, please.
ROSE: You'll be closed, won't you?
MAGPIE: What?
ROSE: For the big day? The coronation.
MAGPIE: Yes, yes, of course. The big day. I'm sure you'll find somewhere to watch it. Please go.
ROSE: Seems to me half of London's got a television, since you're practically giving them away.
MAGPIE: I have my reasons.
ROSE: And what are they?
WIRE: Hungry! Hungry!
ROSE: What's that?
MAGPIE: It's just a television. One of these modern programmes. Now, I really do think you should leave. Right now!
ROSE: Not until you've answered my questions. How come's your televisions are so cheap?
MAGPIE: It's my patriotic duty. Seems only right that as many folk as possible get to watch the coronation. We may be losing the Empire but we can still be proud. Twenty million people they reckon'll be watching. Imagine that. And twenty million people can't be wrong, eh, so why don't you get yourself back home and get up, bright and early, for the big day.
ROSE: Nah, I'm not leaving till I've seen everything.
MAGPIE: I need to close.
ROSE: Mister Magpie, something's happening out there. Ordinary people are being struck down and changed, and the only new thing in the house is a television. Your television. What's going on?
MAGPIE: I knew this would happen. I knew I'd be found out.
ROSE: All right, then, it's just you and me. You going to come clean, then? What's really in it for you?
MAGPIE: For me? Perhaps some peace.
ROSE: From what?
MAGPIE: From her.
ROSE: That's just a woman on the telly. That's just a programme.
WIRE: What a pretty little girl.
ROSE: Oh, my God. Are you talking to me?
WIRE: Yes I'm talking to you, little one. Unseasonably chilly for the time of year, don't you think?
ROSE: What are you?
WIRE: I'm the Wire, and I'm hungry!
ROSE: Magpie, help me!
MAGPIE: Just think of that audience tomorrow, my dear, all settling down to watch the coronation. Twenty million people. Things will never be the same again. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
ROSE: Help me.
WIRE: Goodnight, children, everywhere.
BISHOP: Start from the beginning. Tell me everything you know.
DOCTOR: Well, for starters, I know you can't wrap your hand around your elbow and make your fingers meet.
BISHOP: Don't get clever with me. You were there today at Florizel Street, and now breaking into this establishment. Now you're connected with this. Make no mistake.
DOCTOR: Well, the thing is, Detective Inspector Bishop.
BISHOP: How do you know my name?
DOCTOR: It's written inside your collar. Bless your mum. But I can't help thinking, Detective Inspector, you're not exactly doing much detective inspecting, are you?
BISHOP: I'm doing everything in my power.
DOCTOR: All you're doing is grabbing those faceless people and hiding them as fast as you can. Don't tell me orders from above, hmm? Coronation Day. The eyes of the world are on London Town so any sort of problem just gets swept out of sight.
BISHOP: The nation has an imagine to maintain.
DOCTOR: But doesn't it drive you mad, doing nothing? Don't you want to get out there and investigate?
BISHOP: Of course I do. But, with all the crowds expected, we haven't got the man power. Even if we did, this is beyond anything we've ever seen. I just don't know anymore. Twenty years on the force, I don't even know where to start. We haven't the faintest clue what's going on.
DOCTOR: Well, that could change.
BISHOP: How?
DOCTOR: Start from the beginning. Tell me everything you know.
BISHOP: We started finding them about a month ago. Persons left sans visage. Heads just blank.
DOCTOR: Is there any sort of pattern?
BISHOP: Yes, spreading out from North London. All over the city. Men, women, kids, grannies. The only real lead is there's been quite a large number in
DOCTOR: Florizel Street.
CRABTREE: Found another one, sir.
BISHOP: Oh, er, good man, Crabtree. Here we are, Doctor. Take a good look. See what you can deduce.
DOCTOR: Rose.
BISHOP: You know her?
DOCTOR: Know her? She
CRABTREE: They found her in the street, apparently, over by  Square, abandoned.
BISHOP: That's unusual. That's the first one out in the open. Heaven help us if something happens in public tomorrow for the big day. We'll have Torchwood on our backs then, make no mistake.
DOCTOR: They did what?
BISHOP: I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: They left her where?
BISHOP: Just in the street.
DOCTOR: In the street. They left her in the street. They took her face and just chucked her out and left her in the street. And as a result, that makes things simple. Very, very simple. Do you know why?
BISHOP: No.
DOCTOR: Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop, there is no power on this Earth that can stop me. Come on!
BISHOP: The big day dawns.
EDDIE: You've had your fun with your little Doctor, but now you're left with me, Rita. So you'll behave yourself and smile.
EDDIE: Here we go, everyone. Here we go. Grub's up, grub's up. Tuck in, everyone. Tuck in. Take a sandwich. Oh, here we go, here we go, it's started. Look, look. Take your places. Sit down, sit down. That's it. There we are.
WILMOT : The East front of the palace on which all eyes are
BETTY: Rita, love. Just look at that telly box then. Ee, innit marvellous. The picture's so clear.
EDDIE: Here, Bet. I says to Rita, I says, you didn't need to get your hair done special, love. The Queen won't be able to see you!
BETTY: Where's your old mum, then? She can't go missing it.
RITA: Sorry. Er, mum can't make it down.
BETTY: Oh, bless her. Maybe we could pop up and see her later.
TOMMY: Maybe you could. It's a good idea. What do you think, dad? Maybe Aunty Betty can go and see Gran later?
EDDIE: Oh, he loves his Gran, this one. Proper little mummy's boy all round.
BETTY: Oh, you know what they say about them. Eddie, you want to beat that out of him.
EDDIE: That's exactly what I'm going to do.
TOMMY: I'll get it.
WILMOT : Will first appear in about ten minutes time riding in the Gold Coach of State.
DOCTOR: Tommy, talk to me. I need to know exactly what happened inside your house.
EDDIE: What the blazes do you think you're doing?
TOMMY: I want to help, dad.
DOCTOR: Mister Connolly
EDDIE: Shut your face, you, whoever you are. We can handle this ourselves. Listen, you little twerp. You're hardly out of the blooming' cradle, so I don't expect you to understand. But I've got a position to maintain. People round here respect me. It matters what people think.
TOMMY: Is that why you did it, dad?
EDDIE: What do you mean? Did what?
TOMMY: You ratted on Gran. How else would the police know where to look, unless some coward told them
EDDIE: How dare you! Do you think I fought a war just so a mouthy little scum like you could call me a coward?
TOMMY: You don't get it, do you? You fought against fascism, remember? People telling you how to live, who you could be friends with, who you could fall in love with, who could live and who had to die. Don't you get it? You were fighting so that little twerps like me could do what we want, say what we want. Now you've become just like them. You've been informing on everyone, haven't you? Even Gran. All to protect your precious reputation.
RITA: Eddie is that true?
EDDIE: I did it for us, Rita. She was filthy. A filthy, disgusting thing!
RITA: She's my mother. All the others you informed on, all the people in our street, our friends.
EDDIE: I had to. I, I did the right thing.
RITA: The right thing for us or for you, Eddie? You go, Tommy. Go with the Doctor and do some good. Get away from this house, it's poison. We had a ruddy monster under this roof, all right, but it weren't my mother!
EDDIE: Rita!
DOCTOR: Tommy?
BETTY: What was all that, then?
RITA: That was, that was the sound of something ending. And about time too. Everyone all right? Smashing. Nothing's going to spoil our big day, is it?
DOCTOR: Tommy, tell me about that night. The night she changed.
TOMMY: She was just watching the telly.
DOCTOR: Rose said it. She guessed it straight away. Of course she did. All these aerials in one little street. How come?
TOMMY: Bloke up the road, Mister Magpie, he's selling them cheap.
BISHOP: Is he, now?
DOCTOR: Come on!
BISHOP : Here, you can't do that
DOCTOR: Shop! If you're here, come out and talk to me! Magpie!
TOMMY: Maybe he's out.
DOCTOR: Looks like it
DOCTOR: Oh, hello. This isn't right. This is very much not right. Tastes like iron. Bakelite. Put together with human hands, yes, but the design itself. Oh, beautiful work. That is so simple.
BISHOP: That's incredible. It's like a television, but portable. A portable television.
DOCTOR: It's not the only power source in this room.
TOMMY: Gran?
DOCTOR: I'm on my way.
MAGPIE: What do you think you're doing?
DOCTOR: I want my friend restored, and I think that's beyond a little backstreet electrician, so tell me, who's really in charge here?
WIRE: Yoo hoo! I think that must be me. Ooh, this one's smart as paint.
BISHOP: Is she talking to us?
MAGPIE: I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm afraid you've brought this on yourselves. May I introduce you to my new friend.
WIRE: Jolly nice to meet you.
BISHOP: Oh my God, it's her, that woman off the telly.
DOCTOR: No, it's just using her image.
TOMMY: What? What are you?
WIRE: I'm the Wire, and I will gobble you up, pretty boy. Every last morsel. And when I have feasted, I shall regain the corporeal body, which my fellow kind denied me.
BISHOP: Good Lord. Colour television!
DOCTOR: So your own people tried to stop you?
WIRE: They executed me. But I escaped in this form and fled across the stars.
DOCTOR: And now you're trapped in the television.
WIRE: Not for much longer.
TOMMY: Doctor, is this what got my Gran?
DOCTOR: Yes, Tommy. It feeds off the electrical activity of the brain, but it gorges itself like a great overfed pig, taking people's faces, their essences. It stuffs itself.
BISHOP: And you let her do it, Magpie.
MAGPIE: I had to. She allowed me my face. She's promised to release me at the time of manifestation.
TOMMY: What does that mean?
WIRE: The appointed time. My crowning glory.
BISHOP: Doctor, the coronation!
DOCTOR: For the first time in history, millions gathered around a television set. But you're not strong enough yet, are you? You can't do it all from here. That's why you need this. You need something more powerful! This will turn a big transmitter into a big receiver.
WIRE: What a clever thing you are! But why fret about it? Why not just relax? Kick off your shoes and enjoy the Coronation. Believe me, you'll be glued to the screen.
BISHOP: Doctor!
WIRE: Hungry! Hungry! The Wire is hungry! Ah, this one is tasty. Oh, I'll have lashings of him! Delicious!
WIRE: Ah! Armed. He's armed and clever. Withdraw! Withdraw!
WIRE: The box, Magpie! The box!
WIRE: Hold tight.
WIRE: Conduct me to my victory, Magpie.
WIRE: Hungry! Hungry! Feed me!
BETTY: Oh, she's so lovely.
RITA: Beautiful. Makes you forget all your troubles. Everyone alright for pop?
DOCTOR: Tommy, wake up. Tommy, come on!
TOMMY: What happened?
DOCTOR: Where's Magpie?
TOMMY: We don't even know where to start looking. It's too late.
DOCTOR: It's never too late, as a wise person once said. Kylie, I think. The Wire's got big plans. It'll need. Yes, yes, yes, it's got to harvest half the population. Millions and millions of people and where are we?
TOMMY: Muswell Hill.
DOCTOR: Muswell Hill. Muswell Hill! Which means Alexandra Palace, biggest TV transmitter in North London. Oh, that's why it chose this place. Tommy?
TOMMY: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: We're going shopping.
TOMMY: Is this what you want?
DOCTOR: Perfect! Right, I need one more thing.
DOCTOR: Got it. Let's go.
MAGPIE: I cant do this! Please, please don't make me!
WIRE: The time is at hand. Feed me! Feed me!
TOMMY: There!
DOCTOR: Come on!
GUARD: Wait, wait, wait! Where do you think
OFFICIAL: Oh! I'm very sorry, sir. Shouldn't you be at the Coronation?
DOCTOR: They're saving me a seat.
TOMMY: Who did he think you were?
DOCTOR: King of Belgium, apparently.
DOCTOR: Keep this switched on. Don't let anyone stop you, Tommy. Everything depends on it. You understand?
OFFICIAL: You'll get yourself killed up there! Your Majesty!
WIRE: Feed me!
WIRE: Oh. Feast. Feasting The Wire is feasting.
MAGPIE: It's too late! It's too late for all of us!
WIRE: I shall consume you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I won't let you do this, Magpie!
MAGPIE: Help me, Doctor. It burns. It took my face, my soul.
WIRE: You cannot stop the Wire. Soon I shall become manifest.
MAGPIE: No more of this. You promised me peace!
WIRE: And peace you shall have.
DOCTOR: Been burning the candle at both ends? You've overextended yourself, Missis. You shouldn't have had a crack at poor old Magpie there.
DOCTOR: Rubber soles, swear by them!
WIRE: Oh dear. Has our little plan gone horribly wrong, Doctor?
DIMBLEBY : Or coat of Chivalry of Cloth of Gold, lined with crimson satin.
ARCHBISHOP : Are you willing to do the same?
WIRE: No!
 
DOCTOR: It's close down, I'm afraid, and no epilogue.
DOCTOR: What have I missed?
TOMMY: Doctor! What happened?
DOCTOR: Sorted. Electrical creature, TV technology, clever alien life form. That's me by the way. I turned the receiver back into a transmitter and I trapped the Wire in here.
.
DOCTOR: I just invented the home video thirty years early. Betamax. Oh, look. God save the Queen, eh?
GRAN: Oh, it's my grandson, Oh, son!
RITA: This was never your house. It's in my mother's name. And on her behalf I'm telling you, out.
ROSE: We could go down the Mall, join in with the crowds.
DOCTOR: Nah, that's just pomp and circumstance. This is history right here.
ROSE: The domestic approach.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
ROSE: Will it, that thing, is it trapped for good on video?
DOCTOR: Hope so. Just to be on the safe side though, I'll use my unrivalled knowledge of transtemporal extirpation methods to neutralise the residual electronic pattern.
ROSE: You what?
DOCTOR: I'm going to tape over it.
ROSE: Just leave it to me. I'm always doing that.
DOCTOR: Tell you what, Tommy, you can have the scooter. Little present. Best, er, keep it in the garage for a few years though, eh?
TOMMY: Good riddance.
DOCTOR: Is that it, then, Tommy? New monarch, new age, new world. No room for a man like Eddie Connelly.
TOMMY: That's right. He deserves it.
ROSE: Tommy, go after him.
TOMMY: What for?
ROSE: He's your dad.
TOMMY: He's an idiot.
ROSE: Of course he is. Like I said, he's your dad. But you're clever. Clever enough to save the world, so don't stop there. Go on.
