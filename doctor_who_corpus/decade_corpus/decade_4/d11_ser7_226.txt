Asylum of the Daleks
DOCTOR: I don't think I asked you to sit.
FIGURE: There is a woman who wants to meet you.
DOCTOR: That's nice, but I'm married.
FIGURE: Your help is required.
DOCTOR: I don't discuss my business in public.
FIGURE: I know.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
FIGURE: A messenger.
DOCTOR: Whose messenger?
FIGURE: Darla von Karlsen.
DOCTOR: Never heard of her.
DOCTOR: Where's the tea room?
FIGURE: You were never in the tea room.
DOCTOR: Oh. Of course. Psychic projection. Someone's sending me a dream message. Well, I hope I fell asleep somewhere comfy.
FIGURE: Do you recognise where you are?
DOCTOR: Can't remember. How do you hang up on this thing?
FIGURE: You can't.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah? And what if I just wake up?
FIGURE: No, Doctor. The beach isn't real either. You are still dreaming.
FIGURE: Spacetime coordinates. You will meet Darla von Karlsen here. Her daughter is in danger, and only you can save her. You recognise the planet?
DOCTOR: Yes.
FIGURE: Say it.
DOCTOR: No.
FIGURE: Name the planet.
DOCTOR: I will not say that name.
FIGURE: Say it.
DOCTOR: No!
FIGURE : Name the planet. Name the planet. Name the planet.
DOCTOR: Skaro.
DARLA : First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man who fought them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course, who believe this man somehow survived, and that one day he will return. For both our sakes, dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories are true.
DOCTOR: I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me messages.
DARLA: I have a daughter, Hannah. She's in a Dalek prison camp. They say you can help.
DOCTOR: Do they? I wish they'd stop. I love your choice of meeting place.
DARLA: They said I'd have to intrigue you.
DOCTOR: Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of it. Who told you about me?
DARLA: Does it matter?
DOCTOR: Maybe not, but you're very well informed. If Hannah's in a Dalek prison camp, tell me, why aren't you?
DARLA: I escaped.
DOCTOR:  No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You're very cold.
DARLA: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: It's a trap.
DARLA: What is?
DOCTOR: You are, and you don't even know it.
DALEK : The Doctor is acquired.
AMY: I'll just be a minute.
PA: Your husband is here.
AMY: Hmm. I don't have a husband.
PA: Oh, well, apparently you still do.
RORY: You have to sign these.
AMY: And then we're not married?
RORY: Just like magic.
AMY: Can't chat. Working.
RORY: Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera.
AMY: Rory?
CASSANDRA: Sorry, love. Was I interrupting?
AMY: No.
CASSANDRA: Gosh, look at you. You've gone so pale. Come on, take a seat. We'll soon sort that out.
DALEK : Amelia Pond is acquired.
RORY: Cheers.
DALEK : Rory Williams is acquired.
RORY: Where are we?
RORY: So how much trouble are we in?
DOCTOR : How much trouble, Mister Pond?
DOCTOR: Out of ten? Eleven.
AMY: Where are we? A spaceship, right?
DOCTOR: Not just any spaceship. The Parliament of the Daleks. Be brave.
AMY: What do we do?
DOCTOR: Make them remember you. Well, come on then. You've got me. What are you waiting for? At long last, it's Christmas! Here I am.
DALEK PM: Save us. You will save us.
DOCTOR: I'll what?
DALEK: You will save the Daleks.
DALEKS: Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks. Save the Daleks.
DOCTOR: Well.
DALEKS: Save the Daleks.
DOCTOR: This is new.
OSWIN : Day three six three. The terror continues. Also, made another soufflé, very nearly. Check defences. They came again last night. Still always at night. Maybe they're vampires. Oh, and it's my mum's birthday. Happy birthday, mum.
OSWIN: I did make you a soufflé, but it was too beautiful to live.
DALEK : You will let us enter! We will enter! We will enter!
RORY: What's he doing?
AMY: He's chosen the most defendable area in the room, counted all the Daleks, counted all the exits, and now he's calculating the exact distance we're standing apart and starting to worry. Oh, and look at him frowning now.
AMY: Something's wrong with Amy and Rory, and who's going to fix it? And he straightens his bow tie.
DALEK PM: We have arrived.
DOCTOR: Arrived where?
DALEK PM: Doctor.
DARLA: The Prime Minister will speak with you now.
DOCTOR: Do you remember who you were before they emptied you out and turned you into their puppet?
DARLA: My memories are only reactivated if they are required to facilitate cover or disguise.
DOCTOR: You had a daughter.
DARLA: I know. I've read my file.
DOCTOR: Well?
DALEK PM: What do you know of the Dalek Asylum?
DOCTOR: According to legend, you have a dumping ground. A planet where you lock up all the Daleks that go wrong. The battle-scarred, the insane, the ones even you can't control. It's never made any sense to me.
DALEK PM: Why not?
DOCTOR: Because you'd just kill them.
DALEK PM: It is offensive to us to extinguish such divine hatred.
DOCTOR: Offensive?
DALEK PM: Does it surprise you to know the Daleks have a concept of beauty?
DOCTOR: I thought you'd run out of ways to make me sick. Hello again. You think hatred is beautiful.
DALEK PM: Perhaps that is why we have never been able to kill you.
DARLA: The Asylum. It occupies the entire planet, right to the core.
DOCTOR: How many Daleks are in there?
DARLA: A count has not been made. Millions, certainly.
DOCTOR: All still alive?
DARLA: It has to be assumed. The Asylum is fully automated. Supervision is not required.
AMY: Armed?
DARLA: The Daleks are always armed.
RORY: What colour? I'm sorry, there weren't any good questions left.
DARLA: This signal is being received from the very heart of the Asylum.
WHITE: What is the noise? Explain. Explain.
DOCTOR: Er, it's me.
RORY: Sorry, what?
DOCTOR: It's me, playing the triangle. Okay, I got buried in the mix. Carmen. Lovely show. Someone's transmitting this. Have you considered tracking back the signal and talking to them? He asked the Daleks.
DOCTOR : Hello? Hello? Carmen
DOCTOR: Hello?
OSWIN: Hello?
DOCTOR : Come in. Come in.
DOCTOR: Come in, Carmen.
OSWIN: Hello! Yes, yes, sorry. Do you read me?
DOCTOR: Yes, reading you loud and clear. Identify
DOCTOR : Yourself and report your status.
OSWIN: Hello. Are you real? Are you actually, properly, real?
DOCTOR: Yes, confirmed. Actually, properly, real.
OSWIN : Oswin Oswald, junior entertainment officer, starship
OSWIN: Alaska. Current status, crashed and shipwrecked somewhere not nice. Been here a year, rest of the crew missing. Provisions good but keen to move on.
DOCTOR: A year? Are you okay? Are you under attack?
OSWIN : Some local lifeforms.
OSWIN: Been keeping them out.
DOCTOR : Do you know what those lifeforms are?
OSWIN: I know a Dalek when I hear one, yeah.
DOCTOR: What have you been doing on your own against the Daleks for a year?
OSWIN: Making soufflés?
DOCTOR: Soufflés? Against the Daleks? Where'd you get the milk?
WHITE: This conversation is irrelevant.
DOCTOR: No, it isn't.
OSWIN: No! Hello? Hello?
DOCTOR: Because a starliner has crashed into your Asylum, and someone's got in. And if someone can get in, then everything can get out. A tsunami of insane Daleks. Even you don't want that.
WHITE: The Asylum must be cleansed.
DOCTOR: Then why is it still here? You've enough firepower on this ship to blast it out of the sky.
DARLA: The Asylum forcefield is impenetrable.
DOCTOR: Turn it off.
DARLA: It can only be turned off from within the Asylum.
DOCTOR: A small taskforce could sneak through a forcefield. Send in a couple of Daleks. Oh.  Oh. Oh, that's good. That's brilliant. You're all too scared to go down there. Not one of you will go, so tell me, what do the Daleks do when they're too scared?
WHITE: The Predator of the Daleks will be deployed.
DOCTOR: You don't have a Predator, and even if you did, why would they turn off a forcefield for you?
DALEK PM: Because you will have no other means of escape.
DARLA: May I clarify? The Predator is the Dalek's word for you.
DOCTOR: Me? Me?
DARLA: You will need this. It will protect you from the nanocloud.
DOCTOR: The what? The nano what?
DARLA: The gravity beam will convey you close to the source of the transmission. You must find a way to deactivate the forcefield from there.
DOCTOR: You're going to fire me at a planet? That's your plan? I get fired at a planet and expected to fix it.
RORY: In fairness, that is slightly your M O.
DOCTOR: Don't be fair to the Daleks when they're firing me at a planet.
DOCTOR: What do you want with them?
WHITE: It is known the Doctor required companions.
RORY: Oh, brilliant. Good oh.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. We'll get through this, I promise. Don't be scared.
AMY: Scared? Who's scared. Geronimo.
DOCTOR: Ha! Oi!
ALL: Argh!
RORY: Wrong way up! Wrong way up!
AMY: Doctor!
HARVEY: Hello? Hello? Who are you? You okay?
AMY: Rory? Doctor?
HARVEY: I'm Harvey. No. Who's Rory?
HARVEY: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Oh, ha, ha, ha.
OSWIN [OC}: Sorry, sorry. Pressed the wrong switch.
DOCTOR: Soufflé girl?
OSWIN: You can always call me Oswin, seeing as that's my name. You okay?
DOCTOR : How are you doing that, eh? This is Dalek technology.
OSWIN: It's very easy to hack.
DOCTOR : No, it isn't. Where are you?
OSWIN: The ship broke up when it hit. Somewhere underground, I think. You coming to get me?
AMY : Doctor?
DOCTOR : Hey! Oi! Soufflé girl!
OSWIN: Damn.
DOCTOR : Come back!
AMY: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Amy! Hey, where's Rory?
HARVEY: There was another beam. There. Over there. Are you the rescue team?
OSWIN: Hello?
AMY: Rory? Rory! Rory!
HARVEY: We came down two days ago. There's twelve of our escape pods. I don't know what happened to them.
AMY: Alaska? That's the same ship as soufflé girl.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Except she's been here a year.
HARVEY: We should have some climbing rope long enough for that hole.
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce us to your crew?
HARVEY: Ah, yes, sorry. Guys, this is the Doctor and Amy.
HARVEY: Guys?
HARVEY: Oh, my god.
DOCTOR: They're dead. All of them.
HARVEY: That's not possible. I just spoke to them. Two hours ago. We were doing engine repairs.
DOCTOR: You're sure about that, are you? Because I'd say they've all been dead for a very long time.
HARVEY: But they can't have been.
AMY: Well, they didn't get in this state in two hours.
HARVEY: No, of course. Stupid me.
AMY: Of course what?
HARVEY: I died outside, and the cold preserved my body. I forgot about dying.
DOCTOR: Amy, the door!
AMY: Come on, come on.
AMY: Explain. That's what you're good at. How'd he get all Daleked?
DOCTOR: Because he wasn't wearing one of these. Oh, ho, ho. That's clever. The nanocloud. Microorganisms that automatically process any organic matter, living or dead, into a Dalek puppet. Anything attacks this place, it automatically becomes part of the on-site security.
AMY: Living or dead?
DOCTOR: These wristbands protect us. The only thing stopping us going exactly the way he did
AMY: Doctor, shut up! Living or dead?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Living or, or
DOCTOR: Dead. Oh dear.
AMY: Is it bad that I've really missed this?
DOCTOR: Yes.
AMY: Good.
DOCTOR: I know.
OSWIN: Unauthorised personnel may not enter the cockpit.
DOCTOR: Shut up.
OSWIN : Oh, Mister Grumpy.
OSWIN: Bad combo. No sense of humour in that chin.
AMY : Is that her again, soufflé girl?
DOCTOR : Yeah, she. Oi, what is wrong with my chin?
OSWIN: Careful, dear. You'll put someone's eye out.
OSWIN : Scanning you. You're in another of the escape pods from the Alaska, right?
OSWIN: Same ship I was on.
DOCTOR : How can you hack into everything? It should be impossible. You're in a crashed ship!
OSWIN: Long story. Is there a word for total screaming genius that sounds modest and a tiny bit sexy?
DOCTOR : Doctor. You call me the Doctor.
OSWIN: See what you did there.
OSWIN: Check the floor. I'm picking up a breach at floor level. There could be a way out. See you later.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Hatch. Looks like it's been used already and they've tried to block it off behind them.
AMY: Can't imagine why.
DOCTOR: The lower part of the pod is buried, so this must go straight down to the Asylum.
AMY: Where Rory is.
DOCTOR: Speaking of Rory, is there anything you want to tell me?
AMY: Are we going to do this now?
DOCTOR: What happened?
AMY: Oh, stuff. You know. We split up. What can you do?
DOCTOR: What can I do?
AMY: Nothing. It's not one of those things you can fix like you fix your bowtie. Don't give me those big wet eyes, Raggedy Man. It's life. Just life. That thing that goes on when you're not there.
AMY: Okay, so somebody else got out this way, then.
DOCTOR: Yeah, let's go and find them. Oh, hello, hello, hello. What are they up to?
AMY: What's that?
DOCTOR: One of these.  But where did they get it?
AMY: Doctor, they got it from me.
DOCTOR: Oh, Amy.
AMY: Doctor, what's going to happen to me? Seriously. Tell me what.
RORY: Shush.
RORY: What? Sorry, what?
DALEK: Eg eg eg eg eg eg eg.
RORY: Eggs? You mean those things?
DALEK: Egg.
RORY: I don't, I don't know what you want. Those things. Are those things eggs? This? You want this.
DALEK: Egg. Stir. Min. Ate.
DALEK: Exterminate.
DALEKS: Exterminate.
DALEK: Emergency. Emergency. Exterminate. Exterminate.
OSWIN : Run! The door at the end, run for it. They're waking up, but they're slow. The door at the end. Just run. Now! Now! Now!
DALEKS: Exterminate. Exterminate.
OSWIN : So, anyway, I'm Oswin. What do I call you?
RORY: Er, I can't remember. Er, Rory.
OSWIN: Lovely name, Rory. First boy I ever fancied was called Rory.
RORY : Okay.
OSWIN: Actually, she was called Nina. I was going through a phase.
OSWIN : Just flirting to keep you cheerful.
DALEKS : Exterminate. Exterminate.
RORY: Er, okay, any time you want to start flirting again is fine by me.
AMY: So tell me, what's going to happen to me? And don't lie. Because I know when you're lying to me and I will definitely fall on you.
DOCTOR: The air all around is full of micro-machines. Robots the size of molecules. Nanogenes. Now that you're unprotected, you're being re-written.
AMY: So, what happens? I get one of those things sticking out of my head?
DOCTOR: Physical changes come later.
AMY: What comes first? How does it start?
DOCTOR: With your mind. Your feelings, your memories, and I'm sorry but it's started already.
AMY: How do you know?
DOCTOR: Because we've had this conversation four times.
AMY: Okay, scared now.
DOCTOR: Hang on to scared. Scared isn't Dalek.
OSWIN : Hey there, beakie boy.
RORY: If it's a straight choice, I prefer Nina.
OSWIN : Loving this. The nose and the chin.
OSWIN: You two could fence. There's a door behind you.
 
OSWIN: In there, quickly. Okay, you're safe for now. Pop your shirt off, quick as you like.
RORY : Why?
OSWIN: Does there have to be a reason?
AMY: What's that?
DOCTOR: Keep a look out. Don't open this door. Oswin!
DOCTOR: Oswin, can you hear me?
OSWIN: Hello, the chin. I have visual on you.
DOCTOR : Why don't I have a visual on you? Why can't I ever see you?
OSWIN: Limited power, bad hair, take your pick. There's a door to your left. Open it.
OSWIN : I'm going to send you a map to that screen. I put your little friend somewhere safe. I can get you to him.
DOCTOR : Rory. You found Rory?
OSWIN: I call him Nina. Personal thing. Hush now.
AMY: Who are you? Doctor?
DOCTOR : How many Daleks directly ahead of me right now?
OSWIN: Ten, twenty.
OSWIN : Hard to say. Some of them are catatonic but they do have firepower.
DOCTOR: How do I get past them? Amy!
AMY: Shush. It's okay, it's just people in here. It's just people.
DOCTOR: Amy, it's the nanocloud, it's altering your perception. Look again. Look again. Those aren't people.
DOCTOR: Amy, come out. Take my hand. Run! Run!
AMY: Look, they're coming down!
DOCTOR: Er, oh yes, they are.
DALEK: Intruder.
DOCTOR: Run.
DALEK: Intruder.
DALEK: Intruder.
DOCTOR: It's damaged.
AMY: Okay, but what do we do?
DOCTOR: Identify me. Access your files. Who am I? Come on. Who's your daddy?
DALEK: You are the Predator.
DOCTOR: Access your standing orders concerning the Predator.
DALEK: The Predator must be destroyed.
DOCTOR: And how are you going to do that, Dalek? Without a gun you're a tricycle with a roof. How are you going to destroy me?
DALEK: Self-destruct initiated.
AMY: What's it doing?
DOCTOR: It's going to blow itself up, and I with it. Only weapon it's got left.
DALEK: Self-destruct cannot be countermanded.
DOCTOR: I'm not looking for a countermand, dear. I'm looking for reverse.
DALEK: Forward, forward.
RORY: Oswin?
RORY : What was that? That was close.
RORY: Oswin? What happened? Who killed all the Daleks?
DOCTOR: Who do you think?
RORY: Will sleeping help her? Will it slow down the process?
OSWIN : You'd better hope so
OSWIN: Because pretty soon she's going to try and kill you.
DOCTOR: Amy.
AMY: Ow.
DOCTOR: Amy. Still with us.
RORY: Amy, it's me. Do you remember me?
RORY: She remembers me.
DOCTOR: Same old Amy.
OSWIN: Do you know how you make someone into a Dalek? Subtract love, add anger. Doesn't she seem a bit too angry to you?
AMY: Well, somebody's never been to Scotland.
DOCTOR: What about you, though, Oswin. How come you're okay?
DOCTOR : Why hasn't the nanocloud converted you?
OSWIN: I mentioned the genius thing, yeah? Shielded in here.
DOCTOR: Clever of you. Now, this place. The Daleks said it was fully automated. Look at it. It's a wreck.
OSWIN: Well, I've had nearly a year to mess with them, and not a lot else to do.
DOCTOR : A junior entertainment manager hiding out in a wrecked ship, hacking the security systems of the most advanced warrior race
DOCTOR: The universe has ever seen. But you know what really gets me about you, Oswin? The soufflés. Where do you get milk
DOCTOR : For the soufflés?
DOCTOR: Seriously. Is no one else wondering about that?
RORY: No. Frankly, no. Twice.
OSWIN : So, Doctor.
OSWIN: I've been looking you up. You're all over the database. Why do the Daleks call you the Predator?
DOCTOR : I'm not the Predator, I'm just a man with a plan.
OSWIN: You've got a plan?
RORY: That's all he is.
AMY: There's a nose joke going if someone wants to pick that one off.
DOCTOR: In no particular order, we need to neutralise all the Daleks in this Asylum, rescue Oswin from the wreckage, escape from this planet and fix Amy and Rory's marriage.
AMY: Okay, I'm counting three lost causes. Anyone else?
DOCTOR: Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.
OSWIN : Yes. Got it on the sensors
DOCTOR: The Asylum has a forcefield. The Daleks upstairs are waiting for me to turn it off. Soon as I do, they'll burn this whole world and us with it.
DOCTOR : So, Oswin, my question is this. How fast can you drop the forcefield?
OSWIN: Pretty fast. But why would I?
DOCTOR : Because this is a teleport. Am I right, Oswin?
OSWIN: Yeah. Internal use only.
DOCTOR: I can boost the power. Once the forcefield is down, I can use it to beam us right off this planet.
RORY: You said when the forcefield is down, the Daleks will blow us up.
DOCTOR: We'll have to be quick, yes.
AMY: Fine, we'll be quick. But where do we beam to?
DOCTOR: The only place within range. The Dalek ship.
AMY: They'll exterminate us on the spot.
RORY: Ah, so this is the kind of escape plan where you survive about four seconds longer.
DOCTOR: What's wrong with four seconds? You can do loads in four seconds. Oswin, how fast can you drop the forcefield?
OSWIN: I can do it from here, as soon as you come and get me.
DOCTOR: No, just drop the forcefield and come to us.
OSWIN: There's enough power in that teleport for one go. Why would you wait for me?
DOCTOR: Why wouldn't I?
OSWIN: No idea. Never met you. Sending you a map so you can come get me.
RORY: This place is crawling with Daleks.
OSWIN: Yeah. Kind of why I'm anxious to leave. Come up and see me sometime.
RORY: So, are we going to go get her?
DOCTOR: I don't think that we have a choice. Okay, as soon as the forcefield is down the Daleks will attack. If it gets too explody-wody in here, you go without me, okay?
RORY: And leave you to die?
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry about me. You're the one beaming up to a Dalek ship to get exterminated.
RORY: Fair point. Love this plan. What about Amy?
DOCTOR: Keep her remembering, keep her focused. That'll hold back the conversion.
AMY: What do I do?
DOCTOR: You heard what she said. They're subtracting love. Don't let them.
DALEKS : Emergency. Emergency. Prepare to be annihilated. Emergency. We are the Daleks. We are the Daleks.
RORY: Okay, look at me. I'm going to be logical. Cold and logical, okay? For both of our sakes, for both of us, I'm going to take this off my wrist and put it on yours.
AMY: Why? Then it'll just start converting you. That's not better.
RORY: Yes, but it'll buy us time, because it'll take longer with me.
AMY: Sorry, what?
RORY: It subtracts love, that's what she said.
AMY: What's that got to do with it? What does that even mean?
RORY: It's arithmetic. It'll take longer with me because we both know, we've always known, that. Amy, the basic fact of our relationship is that I love you more than you love me, which today is good news because it might just save both of our lives.
AMY: How can you say that?
RORY: Two thousand years, waiting for you outside a box. Don't say it isn't true, you know it's true. Give me your arm. Amy!
AMY: Don't you dare say that to me. Don't you ever dare.
RORY: Amy, you kicked me out.
AMY: You want kids. You have always wanted kids. Ever since you were a kid. And I can't have them.
RORY: I know.
AMY: Whatever they did to me at Demons Run, I can't ever give you children. I didn't kick you out. I gave you up.
RORY: Amy, I don't
AMY: Don't you dare talk to me about waiting outside a box, because that is nothing, Rory, nothing, compared to giving you up.
RORY: Just give me your arm. Let me put this on you. Just give me your arm!
AMY: Don't touch me!
RORY: It's the Doctor's. When you were sleeping
AMY: That Time Lord. What's the betting he doesn't even need it.
RORY: Why didn't he just tell us?
DOCTOR: Oswin, I think I'm close.
OSWIN: You are. Less than twenty feet away. Which is the good news.
DOCTOR: Okay. And the bad which I suddenly feel is coming?
OSWIN: You're about to pass through Intensive Care.
DOCTOR: What's so special about this lot, then?
OSWIN : Don't know.
OSWIN: Survivors of particular wars. Spiridon, Kembel, Aridius, Vulcan, Exxilon. Ringing any bells?
DOCTOR: All of them.
OSWIN : Yeah? How?
DOCTOR: These are the Daleks who survived me.
DALEK: Doctor.
DALEK 2: Doctor.
DALEKS: Doctor.
OSWIN: That's weird. Those ones don't usually wake up for anything.
DOCTOR : Yeah, well
DOCTOR: Special visitor. Okay, door, but it won't open. I can't be far away, though.
OSWIN: Hang on. Not quite sure. There's a release code. Let me just
OSWIN : Anything out there?
DOCTOR: No.
OSWIN: Hang on, I'm trying to think.
DALEK: Doctor.
DALEKS: Doctor. Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oswin, get this door open.
DOCTOR : Oswin, open this door!
OSWIN: I can't!
DOCTOR: Oswin.
DOCTOR : Just get this door open!
DOCTOR: Oswin! Oswin, please! Get this door open! Help me!
DOCTOR: Stop!
OSWIN : Oh, that is cool.
OSWIN: Tell me I'm cool, chin boy.
DOCTOR: What, what did you do?
OSWIN: Hang on, I think I've found the door thingy.
DOCTOR: No, tell me what you did.
OSWIN : The Daleks, they have a hive mind. Well, they don't, they have a sort of telepathic web.
DOCTOR: The path web, yes.
OSWIN: I hacked into it, did a mass delete
OSWIN : On all the information connected with the Doctor.
DOCTOR: You made them forget me?
OSWIN: Good, eh? And here comes the door.
DOCTOR: I've tried hacking into the path web. Even I couldn't do it.
OSWIN: Come and meet the girl who can. Hey, you're right outside. Come on in.
DOCTOR : Oswin, we have a problem.
OSWIN: No, we don't. Don't even say that. Joined the Alaska to see the universe, ended up stuck in a shipwreck first time out. Rescue me, chin boy, and show me the stars.
DOCTOR : Does it look real to you?
OSWIN: Does what look real?
DOCTOR : Where you are right now.
DOCTOR: Does it seem real?
OSWIN: It is real.
DOCTOR : It's a dream, Oswin. You dreamed it for yourself because the truth was too terrible.
OSWIN: Where am I?
DALEK: Where am I? Where am I?
DOCTOR: Because you are a Dalek.
OSWIN: I am not a
DALEK: Dalek. I am not a Dalek!
OSWIN: I'm human.
DOCTOR: You were human when you crashed here. It was you who climbed out of the pod. That was your ladder.
OSWIN : Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
OSWIN: You mean?
DALEK: Human.
DOCTOR: Not any more. Because you're right. You're a genius. And the Daleks need genius. They didn't just make you a puppet, they did a full conversion.
OSWIN : Where am I? Where am I? Where am I?
DOCTOR : Oswin, I am so sorry, but you are a Dalek. The milk, Oswin. The milk and the eggs for the souffléss. Where, where did it all come from?
OSWIN : Eggs. I'm human. I am not a Dalek, I am human. I am not Dalek, I am human!
DALEK: Eggs.
DOCTOR: It wasn't real. It was never real.
OSWIN : I am a Dalek. I am a Dalek.
OSWIN + DALEK: Eggs.
DALEK: Stir. Min. Ate.
DOCTOR: Oswin.
DALEK: Eggs.
OSWIN: Stir. Min ate.
DALEK: Exterminate.
DOCTOR: Oswin. No, no, no, Oswin. Oswin.
DALEK: Exterminate!
DOCTOR: Listen. Oswin, you don't have to do this.
DALEK: Exterminate!
DOCTOR : Oswin!
OSWIN: Why do they hate you
DALEK: So much? They hate you so much. Why?
DOCTOR: I fought them many, many times.
DALEK: We have grown stronger in fear of you.
DOCTOR: I know. I tried to stop.
OSWIN: Then run.
DOCTOR : What did you say?
OSWIN: I've taken down the forcefield.
DALEK: The Daleks above have begun their attack. Run!
DOCTOR : Oswin, are you
OSWIN: I am Oswin Oswald. I fought the Daleks and I am
DALEK: Human! Remember me.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
DALEK: Run!
OSWIN: Run, you clever boy. And remember.
RORY: How long can we wait?
AMY: The rest of our lives.
RORY: Agreed.
DOCTOR: Right, go! Let's go. We're good. Let's go. Oh, for God's sake.
WHITE: The Asylum is destroyed.
DALEK: Incoming teleport from Asylum planet. We are under attack.
WHITE: Prepare to defend. Defend. Defend!
DALEK PM: Explain, Dalek Supreme.
DOCTOR : You know, you guys should really have seen this coming. The thing about me and teleports, I've got a really good aim. Pin-point accurate, in fact. Or, to put it another way
DOCTOR: Suckers!
DALEK: Identify yourself. Identify. Identify.
DOCTOR: It's me. You know me. The Doctor. The Oncoming Storm. The Predator.
DARLA: Titles are not meaningful in this context. Doctor who?
DALEK PM: Doctor who?
DALEKS: Doctor who?
DOCTOR: Oh, Oswin. Oh, you did it to them all. You beauty.
DALEKS: Doctor who? Doctor who?
DOCTOR: Fellas, you're never going to stop asking.
DALEKS: Doctor who?
RORY: Yes! Yes!
AMY : I can see you.
RORY: Okay.
DOCTOR: Doctor who. Doctor who. Doctor Who!
