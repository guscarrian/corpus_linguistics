The Next Doctor
POLICEMAN: Good afternoon.
SELLER: Hot chestnuts. Chestnuts.
CHOIR: Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy. Oh, tidings
DOCTOR: You there, boy. What day is this?
BOY: Christmas Eve, sir.
DOCTOR: What year?
BOY: You thick or something?
DOCTOR: Oi. Just answer the question.
BOY: Year of our Lord 1851, sir.
DOCTOR: Right. Nice year. Bit dull.
ROSITA : Doctor! Doctor!
DOCTOR: Who, me?
ROSITA  Doctor!
DOCTOR: Don't worry, don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here? 
DOCTOR: Ooo. Okay, I've got it. Whatever's behind that door, I think you should get out of here.
ROSITA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: No, no. I'm standing right here. Hello.
ROSITA: Don't be stupid. Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
ROSITA: Doctor who?
ROSITA: Just the Doctor.
ROSITA: Well, there can't be two of you.
ROSITA: Where the hell have you been?
NEXT DOCTOR: Right then. Don't worry. Stand back. What have we got here then?
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on. Who are you?
NEXT DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Simply, the Doctor. The one, the only and the best. Rosita, give me the sonic screwdriver.
DOCTOR: The what?
NEXT DOCTOR: Now quickly, get back to the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Back to the what?
NEXT DOCTOR: If you could stand back, sir. This is a job for a Time Lord.
DOCTOR: Job for a what lord?
DOCTOR: Oh, that's different.
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, that's new.
TOGETHER: Allons-y.
NEXT DOCTOR: I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight. Now step back, sir.
DOCTOR: Some sort of primitive conversion, like they took the brain of a cat or a dog.
NEXT DOCTOR: Well, talking's all very well. Rosita?
ROSITA: I'm ready.
NEXT DOCTOR: Now, watch and learn.
NEXT DOCTOR: Excellent. Now then, let's pull this timorous beastie down to earth.
DOCTOR: Or not.
NEXT DOCTOR: I might be in a little bit of trouble.
DOCTOR: Nothing changes. I've got you.
ROSITA: You idiots!
NEXT DOCTOR: Perhaps if you could pull?
DOCTOR: I am pulling. In this position, I couldn't not pull, could I?
NEXT DOCTOR: Then I suggest you let go, sir.
DOCTOR: I'm not letting you out of my sight, Doctor. Don't you recognise me?
NEXT DOCTOR: No, should I? Have we met? This is hardly the right time for me to go through my social calendar. Argh!
DOCTOR: Whoa!
DOCTOR: It's going to jump!
NEXT DOCTOR: We're goanna fall!
ROSITA: Well, I'm glad you think it's so funny. You're mad. Both of you. You could've got killed.
NEXT DOCTOR: But evidently we did not. Oh, I should introduce Rosita. My faithful companion. Always telling me off.
DOCTOR: Well, they do, don't they? Rosita. Good name. Hello, Rosita.
ROSITA: Huh. Now I'll have to go and dismantle the traps. All that for nothing. And we've only got twenty minutes till the funeral, don't forget. Then back to the Tardis, right?
DOCTOR: Funeral?
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, long story. Not my own, not yet. Oh, I'm not as young as I was.
DOCTOR: Well, not as young as you were when you were me.
NEXT DOCTOR: When I was who?
DOCTOR: You really don't recognise me?
NEXT DOCTOR: Not at all.
DOCTOR: But you're the Doctor. The next Doctor. Or the next but one. A future Doctor anyway. No, no, don't tell me how it happened. Although, I hope I don't just trip over a brick. That'd be embarrassing. Then again, painless. Worse ways to go. Depends on the brick.
NEXT DOCTOR: You're gabbling, sir. Now might I ask, who are you, exactly?
DOCTOR: No, I'm, er, I'm just. Smith. John Smith. But I've heard all about you, Doctor. Bit of a legend, if I say so myself.
NEXT DOCTOR: Modesty forbids me to agree with you, sir. But yes. Yes, I am.
DOCTOR: A legend with certain memories missing. Am I right?
NEXT DOCTOR: How do you know that?
DOCTOR: You've forgotten me.
NEXT DOCTOR: Great swathes of my life have been stolen away. When I turn my mind to the past, there's nothing.
DOCTOR: Going how far back?
NEXT DOCTOR: Since the Cybermen. Masters of that hellish wall-scuttler and old enemies of mine, now at work in London town. You won't believe this, Mister Smith, but they are creatures from another world.
DOCTOR: Really. Wow.
NEXT DOCTOR: It's said they fell onto London, out of the sky in a blaze of light. And they found me. Something was taken. And something was lost. What was I like, in the past?
DOCTOR: I don't think I should say. Sorry. Got to be careful with memory loss. One wrong word
NEXT DOCTOR: It's strange, though. I talk of Cybermen from the stars and you don't blink, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: Ah, don't blink. Remember that? Whatever you do, don't blink? The blinking and the statues? Sally and the angels? No?
NEXT DOCTOR: You're a very odd man.
DOCTOR: Hmm, I still am. Something's wrong here.
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, the funeral! The funeral's at two o'clock. It's been a pleasure, Mister Smith. Don't breathe a word of it.
DOCTOR: Oh, but can't I come with you?
NEXT DOCTOR: It's far dangerous. Rest assured, I shall keep this city safe. Oh, and, er merry Christmas, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas, Doctor.
CYBERLEADER: Report.
CYBERMAN: Cybershade sixteen has made contact.
CYBERLEADER: Then observe the enemy. This man is dangerous. This man is our enemy. This man is the Doctor.
NEXT DOCTOR : I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight. Now step back, sir.
CYBERLEADER: The attack is scheduled for fourteen hours. Plans for the Ascension demand a successful intervention. Is everything in position?
HARTIGAN: That's rather dependent on you. All I can promise is to do my best.
CYBERLEADER: Define the parameters of best.
HARTIGAN: As you would say, I will operate at maximum efficiency. And you'll keep your part of the bargain?
CYBERLEADER: You will be heralded in the new age, at the Court of the CyberKing.
ALL: The CyberKing will rise.
HARTIGAN: The CyberKing will rise, indeed. How like a man. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to attend.
NEXT DOCTOR: The late Reverend Fairchild, leaving his place of residence for the last time. God rest his soul. Now, with the house empty, I shall effect an entrance at the rear while you go back to the Tardis. This is hardly work for a woman.
ROSITA: Oh, don't mind me saving your life. That's work for a woman, isn't it?
NEXT DOCTOR: The Doctor's companion does what The Doctor says. Off you go.
DOCTOR: Hello.
NEXT DOCTOR: How did you get in?
DOCTOR: Oh, front door. I'm good at doors. Er, do you mind my asking, is that your sonic screwdriver?
NEXT DOCTOR: Yes. I'd be lost without it.
DOCTOR: But that's a screwdriver. How's it sonic?
NEXT DOCTOR: Well, er, it makes a noise. That's sonic, isn't it? Now, since we're acting like common burglars, I suggest we get out of plain view.
DOCTOR: This investigation of yours, what's it about?
NEXT DOCTOR: It started with a murder.
DOCTOR: Oh, good. I mean bad, but whose?
NEXT DOCTOR: Mr Jackson Lake, a teacher of mathematics from Sussex. He came to London three weeks ago and died a terrible death.
DOCTOR: Cybermen?
NEXT DOCTOR: It's hard to say. His body was never found. But then it started. More secret murders, then abductions. Children, stolen away in silence.
DOCTOR: So whose house is this?
NEXT DOCTOR: The latest murder. The Reverend Aubrey Fairchild, found with burns to his forehead, like some advanced form of electrocution.
DOCTOR: But who was he? Was he important?
NEXT DOCTOR: You ask a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I'm your companion.
NEXT DOCTOR: The Reverend was the pillar of the community, a member of many parish boards. A keen advocate of children's charities.
DOCTOR: Children again. But why would the Cybermen want him dead? And what's his connection to the first death, this Jackson Lake?
NEXT DOCTOR: It's funny. I seem to be telling you everything, as though you engendered some sort of trust. You seem familiar, Mister Smith. I know your face. But how?
DOCTOR: I wonder. I can't help noticing you're wearing a fob watch.
NEXT DOCTOR: Is that important?
DOCTOR: Legend has it that the memories of a Time Lord can be contained within a watch. Do you mind?
DOCTOR: It's said that if it's opened
DOCTOR: Oh. Maybe not.
NEXT DOCTOR: It was more for decoration.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Anyway, alien infiltration.
NEXT DOCTOR: Yes. Just look for anything different. Possibly metal. Anything that doesn't seem to belong. Perhaps a mechanical device that could fit no earthly engine.
NEXT DOCTOR: It could even seem to be organic, but unlike any organism of the natural world. Shush! What's that noise?
DOCTOR: Oh, it's just me, whistling. I wonder what's in here, though.
DOCTOR: Ah. Different and metal, you were right.
DOCTOR: They are infostamps. I mean, at a guess. If I were you, I'd say they worked something like this.
DOCTOR: See? Compressed information. Tons of it. That is the history of London, 1066 to the present day. This is like a disc, a Cyberdisc. But why would the Cybermen need something so simple? They've got to be wireless. Unless, they're in the wrong century. They haven't got much power. They need plain old basic infostamps to update themselves. Are you all right?
NEXT DOCTOR: I'm fine.
DOCTOR: No, what is it? What's wrong?
NEXT DOCTOR: I've seen one of these before. I was holding this device the night I lost my mind. The night I regenerated. The Cybermen, they made me change. My mind, my face, my whole self. And you were there. Who are you?
DOCTOR: A friend. I swear.
NEXT DOCTOR: Then I beg you, John. Help me.
DOCTOR: Ah. Two words I never refuse. But it's not a conversation for a dead man's house. It'll make more sense if we go back to the Tardis. Your Tardis. Hold on. I just need to do a little final check. Won't take a tick. There's one more thing I cannot figure. If this room's got infostamps, then maybe, just maybe, it's got something that needs infostamping.
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think we should run.
DOCTOR: Run, Doctor! Now, Doctor!
CYBERMAN: Delete. The Doctor will be deleted.
CYBERMAN 2: Delete.
DOCTOR: Stairs! Can't lead them outside!
CYBERMAN: Delete.
DOCTOR: I'm a dab hand with a cutlass. You don't want to come near me when I've got one of these. This is your last warning. No? Olay, this is really your last warning! Okay, I give up.
CYBERMAN: Delete.
DOCTOR: Listen to me properly. Whatever you're doing stuck in 1851, I can help! I mean it. I'm the only person in the world who can help you! Listen to me!
CYBERMAN: Delete.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. You need me. Check your memory banks. My name's the Doctor. Leave this man alone. The Doctor is me!
CYBERMAN: Delete.
DOCTOR: The Doctor, remember? I'm the Doctor! You need me alive. You need the Doctor, and that's me!
CYBERMAN: Delete.
DOCTOR: Infostamp with a Cyclo-Steinham core. You ripped open the core and broke the safety. Zap! Only the Doctor would think of that.
NEXT DOCTOR: I did that last time.
DOCTOR: Come here. You'll be okay. Let me just check.
NEXT DOCTOR: You told them you were the Doctor. Why did you do that?
DOCTOR: Oh, I was just protecting you.
NEXT DOCTOR: You're trying to take away the only thing I've got, like they did. They stole something, something so precious, but I can't remember. What happened to me? What did they do?
DOCTOR: We'll find out. You and me together.
VICAR: Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working
HARTIGAN: Do continue.
VICAR: Madam, I must protest.
HARTIGAN: Whatever for?
VICAR: A lady at the graveside is debatable enough, but your apparel.
HARTIGAN: Is it too exciting?
COLE: You're disgracing the ceremony, dressed like a harlot.
HARTIGAN: Oh, and you should know, Mister Cole.
COLE: How do you know my name?
HARTIGAN: You've walked past me so many times, all you good men of charity, never once asking my name.
SCOONES: It's Miss Hartigan, isn't it?
HARTIGAN: Oh, you noticed. I saw you looking, you cheeky boy.
VICAR: I'm sorry, but who is she?
HARTIGAN: Matron of the St Joseph Workhouse, your humble servant. Oh, I've watched you all. Visiting, smiling, bestowing your beneficence upon the poor while I scrubbed down their filthy beds.
VICAR: I must insist that you depart.
HARTIGAN: But that's why the late Reverend Fairchild had to die. To gather you all in one place. Where better than a funeral? Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live. Although I've got some friends who might disagree with that. Would you like to meet them? Hark! I can hear them now.
HARTIGAN: Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch, Mister Milligan, stay where you are. You're needed. The rest of you are disposable. Sorry.
VICAR: What manner of men are they?
HARTIGAN: Cybermen.
MAN: Save yourselves!
HARTIGAN: I repeat. Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch, Mister Milligan. Stay.
COLE: You monstrous witch.
HARTIGAN: Merry Christmas to you, too.
SCOONES: But why are we spared? What do you need us for?
HARTIGAN: Your children. It's funny, now I think of it, but in all these years not one of you has asked my first name. It's Mercy.
ROSITA: Doctor! I thought you were dead!
NEXT DOCTOR: Now then, Rosita. A little decorum.
ROSITA: You've been gone for so long. He's always doing this, leaving me behind. Going frantic.
NEXT DOCTOR: What about the Tardis?
ROSITA: Oh, she's ready. Come on.
DOCTOR: I'm looking forward to this.
NEXT DOCTOR; You were right though, Rosita. The Reverend Fairchild's death was the work of the Cybermen.
DOCTOR: So, you live here?
NEXT DOCTOR: A temporary base, until we rout the enemy. The Tardis is magnificent, but it's hardly a home.
DOCTOR: And where's the Tardis now?
NEXT DOCTOR: In the yard.
DOCTOR: Er, what's all this luggage?
NEXT DOCTOR: Evidence. The property of Jackson Lake, the first man to be murdered. Oh, but my new friend is a fighter, Rosita, much like myself. He faced the Cybermen with a cutlass. I'm not ashamed to say, he was braver than I. He was quite brilliant.
NEXT DOCTOR: Are you whistling again?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I am, yeah. Yeah.
ROSITA: That's another man's property.
DOCTOR: Well, a dead man's.
DOCTOR: How did you two meet, then?
ROSITA: He saved my life. Late one night, by the Osterman's Wharf, this creature came out of the shadows. A man made of metal. I thought I was going to die. And then, there he was. The Doctor. Can you help him, sir? He has such terrible dreams. Wakes at night in such a state of terror.
NEXT DOCTOR: Come now, Rosita. With all the things a Time Lord has seen, everything he's lost, he may surely have bad dreams.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Oh, now. Look. Jackson Lake had an infostamp.
NEXT DOCTOR: But how? Is that significant?
DOCTOR: Doctor, the answer to all this is in your Tardis. Can I see it?
NEXT DOCTOR: Mister Smith, it would be my honour.
NEXT DOCTOR: There she is. My transport through time and space. The Tardis.
DOCTOR: You've got a balloon.
NEXT DOCTOR: Tardis. T A R D I S. It stands for Tethered Aerial Release Developed In Style. Do you see?
DOCTOR: Well, I do now. I like it. Good Tardis. Brilliant. Nice one. And is it inflated by gas, yeah?
NEXT DOCTOR: We're adjacent to the Mutton Street Gasworks. I pay them a modest fee. Good work, Jed.
JED: Glad to be of service, sir.
DOCTOR: You've got quite a bit of money.
NEXT DOCTOR: Oh, you get nothing for nothing. How's that ripped panel, Jed?
JED: All repaired. Should work a treat. You never know, maybe tonight's the night, Doctor. Imagine it, seeing Christmas from above.
NEXT DOCTOR: Not just yet, I think. One day, I will ascend. One day soon.
DOCTOR: You've never actually been up?
ROSITA: He dreams of leaving, but never does.
NEXT DOCTOR: I can depart in the Tardis once London is safe. And finally, when I'm up there. Think of it, John. The time and the space.
DOCTOR: The perfect escape. Do you ever wonder what you're escaping from?
NEXT DOCTOR: With every moment.
DOCTOR: Then do you want me to tell you? Because I think I've worked it out now. How you became The Doctor. What do you think? Do you want to know?
HARTIGAN: Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch and Mister Milligan, you have your instructions and the Court of the CyberKing is waiting. First of all, let's just see. A little test. Turn right. Turn left. And face me. Oh, I could do this forever. But now, set about your appointed tasks, and bring them to me.
DOCTOR: The story begins with the Cybermen. A long time away, and not so far from here, the Cybermen were fought, and they were beaten. And they were sent into a howling wilderness called The Void, locked inside forever more. But then a greater battle rose up, so great that everything inside the Void perished. But, as the walls of the world weakened, the last of the Cybermen must have fallen through the dimensions, back in time, to land here. And they found you.
NEXT DOCTOR: I fought them, I know that. But what happened?
DOCTOR: At the same time, another man came to London. Mister Jackson Lake. Plenty of luggage, money in his pocket. Maybe coming to town for the winter season, I don't know. But he found the Cybermen too. And just like you, exactly like you, he took hold of an infostamp.
NEXT DOCTOR: But he's dead. Jackson Lake is dead. The Cybermen murdered him.
DOCTOR: You said no body was ever found. And you kept all his suitcases, but you could never bring yourself to open them. I told you the answer was in the fob watch. Can I see?
DOCTOR: J L. The watch is Jackson Lake's.
ROSITA: Jackson Lake is you, sir?
LAKE: But I'm the Doctor.
DOCTOR: You became the Doctor because the infostamp you picked up was a book about one particular man.
 
DOCTOR: The Cybermen's database. Stolen from the Daleks inside the Void, I'd say, but it's everything you could want to know about the Doctor.
LAKE: That's you.
DOCTOR: Time Lord, Tardis, enemy of the Cybermen. The one and the only. You see, the infostamp must have backfired. Streamed all that information about me right inside your head.
LAKE: I am nothing but a lie.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Infostamps are just facts and figures. All that bravery. Saving Rosita, defending London town, hmm? And the invention. Building a Tardis. That's all you.
LAKE: And what else? Tell me what else.
DOCTOR: There's still something missing, isn't there?
LAKE: I demand you tell me, sir. Tell me what they took.
DOCTOR: Sorry. Really, I am so sorry, but that's an awful lot of luggage for one man. Because an infostamp is plain technology. It's not enough to make a man lose his mind. What you suffered is called a fugue. A fugue state, where the mind just runs away because it can't bear to look back. You wanted to become someone else, because Jackson Lake had lost so much.
ROSITA: Midnight. Christmas Day.
LAKE: I remember. Oh, my God.
LAKE : Caroline, get out!
LAKE: Caroline. They killed my wife. They killed her.
DOCTOR: Oh, you found a whole cache of infostamps.
ROSITA: But what is it? What's that noise?
DOCTOR: Activation. A call to arms. The Cybermen are moving!
LAKE: The Doctor needs help. I learnt that much about him. There should be someone at his side. Now go. Go.
{It is children, not Cybermen, marching past.}
ROSITA: What is it? What's happening? That's Mister Cole. He's Master of the Hazel Street Workhouse. Maybe he's taking them to prayers.
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing as holy as that.
DOCTOR: Can you hear me? Hello? No? Mister Cole, you seem to have something in your ear. Now, this might hurt a bit, but if I can just
DOCTOR: Ah. They're on guard. Can't risk a fight. Not with the children.
ROSITA: But where are they going?
JED: They all need a good whipping, if you ask me. There's tons of them. I've just seen another lot coming down from the Ingleby Workhouse down Broadback Lane.
DOCTOR: Where's that?
ROSITA: This way.
ROSITA: There's dozens of them.
DOCTOR: But what for?
SCOONES: You will continue. You will enter the Court of the CyberKing. March. That is an order. March!
LAKE: Where is it? Where is it?
ROSITA: That's the door to the sluice. All the sewage runs through there, straight into the Thames.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's too well guarded. We'll have to find another way in.
DOCTOR: Whoa! That's cheating, sneaking up. Do you have your legs on silent?
HARTIGAN: So, what do we have here?
DOCTOR: Listen. Just walk towards me slowly. Don't let them touch you.
HARTIGAN: Oh, but they wouldn't hurt me, my fine boys. They are my knights in shining armour, quite literally.
DOCTOR: Even if they've converted you, that's not a Cyber speech pattern. You've still got free will. I'm telling you, step away.
HARTIGAN: There's been no conversion, sir. No one's ever been able to change my mind. The Cybermen offered me the one thing I wanted. Liberation.
ROSITA: Who are you?
HARTIGAN: You can be quiet. I doubt he paid you to talk. More importantly, who are you, sir, with such intimate knowledge of my companions.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
CYBERMAN: Incorrect. You do not correspond to our image of the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah, but that's because your database got corrupted. Oh, look, look, look. Check this. The Doctor's infostamp.
DOCTOR: Plug it in. Go on. Download.
CYBERMAN: The core has been damaged. This infostamp would damage Cyberunits.
DOCTOR: Oh, well. Nice try.
CYBERMAN: Core repaired. Download.
CYBERMAN: You are the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hello.
CYBERMAN: You will be deleted.
DOCTOR: No, no. Oh, but let me die happy. Tell me, what do you need those children for?
HARTIGAN: What are children ever needed for? They're a workforce.
DOCTOR: But for what?
HARTIGAN: Very soon now, the whole Empire will see. And they will bow down in worship.
DOCTOR: And it's all been timed for Christmas Day. Was that your idea, Miss ?
HARTIGAN: Hartigan. Yes. The perfect day for a birth, with a new message for the people. Only this time, it won't be the words of a man.
DOCTOR: The birth of what?
HARTIGAN: A birth, and a death. Namely, yours. Thank you, Doctor. I'm glad to have been part of your very last conversation. Now, delete them.
CYBERMAN: Delete.
 
LAKE: At your service, Doctor.
HARTIGAN: Shades! Shades!
DOCTOR: Run! Come on!
HARTIGAN: Shades!
ROSITA: One last thing.
DOCTOR: Can I say, I completely disapprove. Come on.
HARTIGAN: Get off me. I said, get off. Tell your masters we're not waiting till dawn. The CyberKing will rise tonight!
DOCTOR: That stronghold down by the river. I need to find a way in.
LAKE: I'm ahead of you. My wife and I were moving to London so I could take up a post at the university. And while my memory is still not intact, this was in the luggage. The deeds. Fifteen Latimer Street. And if I discovered the Cybermen there, in the cellar, then
DOCTOR: That might be our way in. Brilliant.
LAKE: There's still more. I remember the cellar and my wife, but I swear there was something else in that room. If we can find that, perhaps that's the key to defeating these invaders. So, onwards!
DOCTOR: Maybe you should go back
ROSITA: Don't even try.
CYBERLEADER: You have wisdom. If the Doctor is planning to intervene, then the Ascension will commence immediately.
HARTIGAN: Excellent. And as for you, Mister Cole, Mister Scoones, Mister Fetch and Mister Milligan, your work is done.
HARTIGAN: Children! Pay attention. Now let the new Industrial Revolution begin. I want to see you work!
CYBERLEADER: Energy levels sixty percent and rising. Soon the CyberKing will awake.
HARTIGAN: Then show me.
CYBERMAN: Delete.
DOCTOR: It must've been guarding this. A Dimension Vault. Stolen from the Daleks again. That's how the Cybermen travelled through time. Jackson, is this it? The thing you couldn't remember?
LAKE: I don't think so. I just can't see. It's like it's hidden.
DOCTOR: Not enough power. Come on! Avanti!
HARTIGAN: Oh, that is magnificent. That is royalty, indeed. And that's quite a throne. Oh, you will look resplendent.
CYBERLEADER: The chair you designate as throne is not intended for me. My function is to serve the CyberKing, not to become the CyberKing.
HARTIGAN: Then who sits there?
HARTIGAN: No! Now, just. I think if you remember correctly you said I was to be heralded.
CYBERLEADER: All hail the CyberKing.
ALL: All hail the CyberKing.
HARTIGAN: But you promised me. You said I would never be converted.
CYBERLEADER: That was designated a lie.
ROSITA: What do the Cybermen want?
DOCTOR: They want us. That's what Cybermen are. Human beings with their brains put into metal shells. They want every living thing to be like them.
HARTIGAN: You can't do this to me!
CYBERLEADER: Incorrect. It is done.
HARTIGAN: But I would have served you anyway!
CYBERLEADER: Your mind is riven with anger and abuse and revenge. These have no place in a Cybermind. Activate. Emotions have tormented you all of your life. Now you will be set free. This is your liberation.
HARTIGAN: Oh, for the love of God, have you no pity?
CYBERLEADER: Correct.
CYBERLEADER: A CyberKing is born.
ALL: All hail the CyberKing.
LAKE: Upon my soul.
ROSITA: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's an engine. They're generating electricity, but what for?
LAKE: We can set them free.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
HARTIGAN: Behold such information.
DOCTOR: Power at ninety percent. But if we stop the engine, the power dies down, the Cybermen'll come running. Ooo. Hold on. Power fluctuation. That's not meant to happen.
LAKE: It's going wrong.
DOCTOR: No, it's weird. The software's rewriting itself. It's changing.
HARTIGAN: I can see the stars, the worlds beyond, the Vortex of Time itself, and the whole of infinity. Oh, but this is glorious!
CYBERLEADER: That is incorrect. Glorious is an emotional response.
HARTIGAN: Exactly. There is so much joy in this machine.
CYBERLEADER: Joy is not acceptable.
HARTIGAN: Don't you see? My mind is stronger than you ever thought. It dominates, sir. It dominates you.
CYBERLEADER: Alert. You are operating beyond the standard parameters.
HARTIGAN: I am new. The might of your technology combined with my own imagination. Yes! There will be a new race of Cybermen. My Cybermen. Logic and strength combined with fury and passion.
CYBERLEADER: Diagnosis, system failure. You will be removed from the processor.
DOCTOR: Whoa! What the hell's happening? It's out of control.
LAKE: It's accelerating. Ninety six percent, ninety seven.
ROSITA: When it reaches a hundred, what about the children?
DOCTOR: They're disposable. Come on!
HARTIGAN: I am CyberKing. My mind inside the Cybermen. And you will obey me!
ALL: All hail the CyberKing!
CYBERMAN: Power levels now at one hundred percent. Delete the workforce.
CYBERMAN 2: Delete.
CYBERMAN 3: Delete. Delete.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, all of you, out! Do you hear me? That's an order! Every single one of you, run!
LAKE: All of you, come on, as fast as you can. Come on!
DOCTOR: There's a hot pie for everyone, if you leg it!
LAKE: Go!
DOCTOR: Rosita, get them out of sluice gate. Once you're out, keep running. Far as you can! Come on, come on, come on.
ROSITA: Turn right at the corner! Fast as you can. And don't stop! Keep running! Keep running!
HARTIGAN: Come, my soldiers. Come to me.
ROSITA: Come on! Come on! Keep running! Keep running!
DOCTOR: Go! Quick, quick. It's some sort of starter motor, but starting what?
FREDERICK  Help! Father! Father! Father
LAKE: That's my son. My son. Doctor, my son!
DOCTOR: What?
LAKE: They took my son. No wonder my mind escaped. Those damned Cybermen, they took my child! But he's alive, Doctor. Frederick!
DOCTOR: Come on!
LAKE: No, he's too scared. Stay there! Don't move! I'm coming.
HARTIGAN: CyberKing rising.
LAKE: I can't get up there. Fred!
DOCTOR: They've finished with the motor. It's going to blow up.
LAKE: What are we going to do, Doctor? What are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Come on, Jackson. You know me.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's it. Hello. Now, hold on tight. Don't let go.
DOCTOR: Merry Christmas.
ROSITA: Go to St Stephen's. Ask for the Warden, he'll take care of you. Now run! Quickly!
MAN: It's under the water! There's something in the Thames!
DOCTOR: Head for the street.
LAKE: Come on, Doctor. Hurry up!
DOCTOR: Gotcha!
HARTIGAN: Behold, I am risen. Witness me, mankind, as CyberKing of all.
DOCTOR: It's a CyberKing.
LAKE: And a CyberKing is what?
DOCTOR: It's a ship. Dreadnought class. Front line of an invasion. And inside the chest, a Cyberfactory, ready to convert millions.
HARTIGAN: And I will walk. I will stride across this tiny little world.
HARTIGAN: My people. Why do they not rejoice?
DOCTOR: Just head south. Take him south. Go to the parkland.
LAKE: But where are you going?!
DOCTOR: To stop that thing.
LAKE: But I should be with you.
DOCTOR: Jackson, you've got your son. You've got a reason to live.
LAKE: And you haven't? God save you, Doctor.
JED: What the hell is that thing, sir?
DOCTOR: Oh, good man. Jed, wasn't it? Jed, I need your help!
JED: I'm not going out there.
DOCTOR: I'll give you five pound notes.
JED: Er. All right. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: The Tardis is going to fly.
HARTIGAN: People of the world, now hear me. Your governments will surrender. And if not, then behold my power.
JED: You're flaming bonkers, sir.
DOCTOR: It's been said before. Now give me.
DOCTOR: Not enough power. Come on! Jed, let her loose.
JED: Ever flown one of these before?
DOCTOR: Nope, never.
JED: Can I have my money now?
DOCTOR: Oh, get on with it.
ROSITA: Oh, sir. I thought I'd lost you.
LAKE: My son, Rosita. This boy is my son.
JED: Good luck to you, sir!
LAKE: It's the Tardis. She's flying.
YOUNG MAN: Who the hell is that?
LAKE: His name, sir, is the Doctor.
CYBERMAN: Attention. Proximity alert.
HARTIGAN: How is that even possible? Oh, this I would see. Turn!
HARTIGAN: Excellent. The Doctor. Yet another man come to assert himself against me in the night.
DOCTOR: Miss Hartigan? I'm offering you a choice. You might have the most remarkable mind this world has ever seen. Strong enough to control the Cybermen themselves.
HARTIGAN: I don't need you to sanction me.
DOCTOR: No, but such a mind deserves to live. The Cybermen came to this world using a Dimension vault. I can use that device to find you a home, with no people to convert, but a new world where you can live out your mechanical life in peace.
HARTIGAN: I have the world below, and it is abundant with so many minds ready to become extensions of me. Why would I leave this place?
DOCTOR: Because if you don't, I'll have to stop you.
HARTIGAN: What do you make of me, sir? An idiot?
DOCTOR: No. The question is, what do you make of me?
HARTIGAN: Destroy him.
DOCTOR: You make me into this.
HARTIGAN: Then I have made you a failure. Your weapons are useless, sir.
DOCTOR: I wasn't trying to kill you. All I did was break the Cyber-connection, leaving your mind open. Open, I think, for the first time in far too many years. So you can see. Just look at yourself. Look at what you've done.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Miss Hartigan, but look at what you've become.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.
LAKE: He's killed it! Whatever he did, he's killed it.
ROSITA: But it's going to fall!
DOCTOR: Ooo, now you're ready.
LAKE: Well, I'd say he used that Dimension vault to transfer the wreckage of the CyberKing into the Time Vortex, t here to be harmlessly disintegrated. Oh, I've picked up a lot. Ah, but here. Ladies and gentlemen, I know that man, that Doctor on high. And I know that he has done this deed a thousand times. But not once. No, sir, not once, not ever, has he ever been thanked. But no more. For I say to you, on this Christmas morn, bravo, sir! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, sir!
LAKE: Bravo, Doctor.
LAKE: The city will recover, as London always does. Though the events of today will be history, spoken of for centuries to come.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Funny that.
LAKE: And a new history begins for me. I find myself a widower, but with my son and with a good friend.
DOCTOR: Now, take care of that one. She's marvellous.
LAKE: Frederick will need a nursemaid and I can think of none better. But you're welcome to join us. We thought we might all dine together at the Traveller's Halt. A Christmas feast in celebration, and in memory of those we have lost. You won't stay?
DOCTOR: Like I said, you know me.
LAKE: No I don't think anyone does.
LAKE: Oh! And this is it. Oh! Oh, if I might, Doctor. One last adventure?
DOCTOR: Oh, be my guest.
LAKE: Oh. Oh my word. Oh. Oh, goodness me. Well. But this is, but this is nonsense.
DOCTOR: Well, that's one word for it.
LAKE: Complete and utter, wonderful nonsense. How very, very silly. Oh, no. I can't bear it. Oh, it's causing my head to ache. No. No, no, no, no, no, no
LAKE: Oh! Oh, gracious. That's quite enough. I take it this is goodbye.
DOCTOR: Onwards and upwards.
LAKE: Tell me one thing. All those facts and figures I saw of the Doctor's life, you were never alone. All those bright and shining companions. But not any more?
DOCTOR: No.
LAKE: Might I ask why not?
DOCTOR: They leave. Because they should. Or they find someone else. And some of them, some of them forget me. I suppose in the end, they break my heart.
LAKE: That offer of Christmas dinner. It's no longer a request, it's a demand. In memory of those we've lost.
DOCTOR: Oh, go on then.
LAKE: Really?
DOCTOR: Just this once. You've actually gone and changed my mind. Not many people can do that. Jackson, if anyone had to be the Doctor, I'm glad it was you.
LAKE: The feast awaits. Come with me. Walk this way.
DOCTOR: I certainly will. Merry Christmas to you, Jackson.
LAKE: Merry Christmas indeed, Doctor.
