Smith and Jones
RADIO: What can happen on an average beautiful day? You never know. Celebrate seasonal changes. It's hot for brothers. On a beautiful sunshiny day.
MARTHA: You're up early. What's happening?
TISH: It's a nightmare, because Dad won't listen, and I'm telling you, Mum is going mental. Swear to God, Martha, this is epic. You've got to get in there and stop him.
MARTHA: How do I do that?
TISH: Tell him he can't bring her.
MARTHA: Hold on, that's Leo. I'll call you back.
LEO: Martha, If Mum and Dad start to kick off, tell them I don't even want a party. I didn't even ask for one. They can always give me the money instead.
MARTHA: Yeah, but why do I have to tell them? Why can't you?  Hold on, that's Mum. I'll call you back.
FRANCINE: I don't mind your father making a fool of himself in private, but this is Leo's 21st, everyone is going to be there, and the entire family is going to look ridiculous.
MARTHA: Mum, it's a party. I can't stop Dad from bringing his girlfriend.  Hold on, that's Dad, I'll call you back.
CLIVE: Martha? Now, tell your mother, Leo is my son, and I'm paying for half that party. I'm entitled to bring who I like.
MARTHA: I know, but think what it's going to look like for Mum, if you're standing there with Annalise.
CLIVE: What's wrong with Annalise?
ANNALISE: Is that Martha? Say hi. Hi, Martha, hi!
MARTHA: Hi, Annalise.
ANNALISE: Big kiss, lots of love, see you at the party, babe. Now, take me shopping, big boy.
DOCTOR: Like so.
DOCTOR: See?
MARTHA: Oi! Watch, it mate.
FLORENCE: I was all right till this morning, and then, I don't know, I woke up and I felt all dizzy again. It was worse than when I came in.
STOKER: Pulse is slightly thready. Well, let's see what Britain's finest might suggest. Any ideas, Morgenstern?
MORGENSTERN: Dizziness can be a sign of early onset diabetes.
STOKER: Hardly early onset, if you'll forgive me, Miss Finnegan. Any more ideas? Swales?
SWALES: Er, could recommend a CT scan.
STOKER: And spend all our money? Jones?
MARTHA: We could take bloods and check for Meniere's disease.
STOKER: Or we could simply ask the patient. What did you have for dinner last night?
FLORENCE: I had salad.
STOKER: And the night before?
FLORENCE: Salad again.
STOKER: And salad every night for the past week, contrary to my instructions. Salt deficiency, that's all. Simple, honest salt.
STOKER: Hippocrates himself expounded on the virtues of salt. Recommended the inhalation of steam from sea water. Though no doubt if he'd been afflicted with my students, results might have been rather more colourful.
STOKER: Now then, Mister Smith, a very good morning to you. How are you today?
DOCTOR: Oh, not so bad. Still a bit, you know, blah.
STOKER: John Smith, admitted yesterday with severe abdominal pains. Jones, why don't you see what you can find? Amaze me.
MARTHA: That wasn't very clever, running around outside, was it?
DOCTOR: Sorry?
MARTHA: On Chancellor Street this morning? You came up to me and took your tie off.
DOCTOR: Really? What did I do that for?
MARTHA: I don't know, you just did.
DOCTOR: Not me. I was here, in bed. Ask the nurses.
MARTHA: Well, that's weird, cause it looked like you. Have you got a brother?
DOCTOR: No, not any more. Just me.
STOKER: As time passes and I grow ever more infirm and weary, Miss Jones.
MARTHA: Sorry. Right.
STOKER: I weep for future generations. Are you having trouble locating the heart, Miss Jones?
MARTHA: Er, I don't know. Stomach cramps?
STOKER: That is a symptom, not a diagnosis. And you rather failed basic techniques by not consulting first with the patient's chart.
MARTHA: That happened to me this morning.
MORGENSTERN: I had the same thing on the door handle.
SWALES: And me, on the lift.
STOKER: That's only to be expected. There's a thunderstorm moving in and lightning is a form of static electricity, as was first proven by. Anyone?
DOCTOR: Benjamin Franklin.
STOKER: Correct.
DOCTOR: My mate, Ben. That was a day and a half. I got rope burns off that kite, and then I got soaked..
STOKER: Quite.
DOCTOR: And then I got electrocuted.
STOKER: Moving on. I think perhaps a visit from psychiatric. And next we have
MARTHA: No, listen, I've worked out a plan. We tell Annelise that the buffet tonight is one hundred per cent carbohydrate, and she won't turn up.
TISH : I wish you'd take this seriously.
TISH: That's our inheritance she's spending, on fake tan. Tell you what, I'm not that far away, I'll drop by for a sandwich and we can draw up a battle plan.
MARTHA: In this weather? I'm not going out. It's pouring down.
TISH: It's not raining here.
TISH: That's weird. It's raining right on top of you, I can see it, but it's dry where I am.
MARTHA: Well, you just got lucky.
TISH: No, but it's like in cartoons. You know, when a man's got a cloud over his head.
MARTHA : Yeah, but listen
MARTHA: I'll tell you what we'll do.
MARTHA: We tell Dad and Annalise to get there early, about seven thirty, and we tell Leo get there at the same time so we can do all that birthday stuff. We tell Mum to get there for about eight thirty, nine, and that gives me time to have a word with Annalise, and
MARTHA: What?
SWALES: The rain.
MARTHA: It's only rain.
TISH: Martha, have you seen the rain?
MARTHA: Why's everyone fussing about rain?
SWALES: It's going up.
  
TISH: The rain is going up.
MARTHA: What the hell was that?
SWALES: Are you all right?
MARTHA: I think so, yeah. It felt like an earthquake, or
SWALES: Martha? It's night. Look. It was lunchtime.
MARTHA: It's not night.
SWALES: But it's got to be. It's dark.
MARTHA: We're on the moon.
SWALES: We can't be.
MARTHA: We're on the moon. We're on the bloody moon.
POLICEMAN: Sorry, miss, no.
TISH: My god.
TISH: Martha? Martha, can you hear me? Martha!
FLORENCE: Have you seen?
MARTHA: I'm sorry, I can't.
MARTHA: All right now, everyone back to bed, we've got an emergency but we'll sort it out. Don't worry.
MARTHA: It's real. It's really real. Hold on.
SWALES: Don't! We'll lose all the air.
MARTHA: But they're not exactly air tight. If the air was going to get sucked out it would have happened straight away, but it didn't. So how come?
DOCTOR: Very good point. Brilliant, in fact. What was your name?
MARTHA: Martha.
DOCTOR: And it was Jones, wasn't it? Well then, Martha Jones, the question is, how are we still breathing?
SWALES: We can't be.
DOCTOR: Obviously we are, so don't waste my time. Martha, what have we got? Is there a balcony on this floor, or a veranda, or
MARTHA: By the patients' lounge, yeah.
DOCTOR: Fancy going out?
MARTHA: Okay.
DOCTOR: We might die.
MARTHA: We might not.
DOCTOR: Good. Come on. Not her, she'd hold us up.
MARTHA: We've got air. How does that work?
DOCTOR: Just be glad it does.
MARTHA: I've got a party tonight. It's my brother's twenty first. My mother's going to be really, really
DOCTOR: You okay?
MARTHA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Sure?
MARTHA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Want to go back in?
MARTHA: No way. I mean, we could die any minute, but all the same, it's beautiful.
DOCTOR: Do you think?
MARTHA: How many people want to go to the moon? And here we are.
DOCTOR: Standing in the Earthlight.
MARTHA: What do you think happened?
DOCTOR: What do you think?
MARTHA: Extraterrestrial. It's got to be. I don't know, a few years ago that would have sounded mad, but these days? That spaceship flying into Big Ben, Christmas, those Cybermen things. I had a cousin. Adeola. She worked at Canary Wharf. She never came home.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
MARTHA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I was there, in the battle.
MARTHA: I promise you, Mister Smith, we will find a way out. If we can travel to the moon, then we can travel back. There's got to be a way.
DOCTOR: It's not Smith. That's not my real name.
MARTHA: Who are you, then?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
MARTHA: Me too, if I can pass my exams. What is it then, Doctor Smith?
DOCTOR: Just the Doctor.
MARTHA: How do you mean, just the Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just the Doctor.
MARTHA: What, people call you the Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
MARTHA: Well, I'm not. As far as I'm concerned, you've got to earn that title.
DOCTOR: Well, I'd better make a start, then. Let's have a look. There must be some sort of
DOCTOR: Forcefield keeping the air in.
MARTHA: But if that's like a bubble sealing us in, that means this is the only air we've got. What happens when it runs out?
DOCTOR: How many people in this hospital?
MARTHA: I don't know. A thousand?
DOCTOR: One thousand people Suffocating.
MARTHA: Why would anyone do that?
DOCTOR: Head's up! Ask them yourself.
MARTHA: Aliens. That's aliens. Real, proper aliens.
DOCTOR: Judoon.
FLORENCE: Mister Stoker? I'm sorry, I didn't know who else to ask, but can you help me?
STOKER: I think we've gone beyond aspirin, Miss er
FLORENCE: Finnegan.
STOKER: Names. What are names now when something unnamable is marching towards us across the moon? Two more years, I thought. Two more years and then retire to Florida. But there is Florida, in the sky. I can see it. My daughter, she's still in university. I am never going to see her again.
FLORENCE: But I need help, Mister Stoker.
STOKER: I can't do anything.
FLORENCE: Oh, I think you can.
STOKER: What do you two want? It's a bit too late to sign for anything.
FLORENCE: These are my lovely boys. I prefer not to get my hands dirty.
STOKER: I'm sorry?
FLORENCE: You see, there are great tests to come, and terrible deeds. Some of them my own. But if I am to survive this, I need you.
STOKER: What are you talking about?
FLORENCE: Blood. Specifically, yours.
STOKER: What are you doing? What are you doing? Well, let go of me! What the hell? Let go.
FLORENCE: You see, I was only salt deficient because I am so very good at absorbing it. But now I need fire in my veins, and who better than a consultant, with blood full of salty fats and vintage wines and all those Michelin star sauces.
STOKER: Who are you?
FLORENCE: Oh, I'm a survivor, Mister Stoker. At any cost. Look, I've even brought a straw.
WOMAN: What are they doing?
JUDOON: Blos so folt do no cro blo cos so ro.
MORGENSTERN: Er, we are citizens of planet Earth. We welcome you in peace.
MORGENSTERN: Please don't hurt me. I was just trying to help. I'm sorry, don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.
JUDOON: Language assimilated. Designation Earth English. You will be catalogued.
JUDOON: Category human.
JUDOON: Catalogue all suspects.
DOCTOR: Oh, look down there, you've got a little shop. I like a little shop.
MARTHA: Never mind that. What are Judoon?
DOCTOR: They're like police. Well, police for hire. They're more like interplanetary thugs.
MARTHA: And they brought us to the moon?
DOCTOR: Neutral territory. According to galactic law, they've got no jurisdiction over the Earth, and they isolated it. That rain, lightning? That was them, using an H2O scoop.
MARTHA: What are you on about, galactic law? Where'd you get that from? If they're police, are we under arrest? Are we trespassing on the moon or something?
DOCTOR: No, but I like that. Good thinking. No, I wish it were that simple. They're making a catalogue. That means they're after something non human, which is very bad news for me.
MARTHA: Why? Oh, you're kidding me. Don't be ridiculous. Stop looking at me like that.
DOCTOR: Come on then.
JUDOON: Troop five, floor one. Troop six, floor two. Identify humans and find the transgressor. Find it.
JUDOON: Prepare to be catalogued.
MORGENSTERN: Do what they say. All they want is to shine this light thing. It's all right. They're not going to hurt us. Just listen to them.
JUDOON: Witness the crime. Charge, physical assault. Plea, guilty. Sentence, execution.
MORGENSTERN: You didn't have to do that.
JUDOON: Justice is swift.
MARTHA: They've reached third floor. What's that thing?
DOCTOR: Sonic screwdriver.
MARTHA: Well, if you're not going to answer me properly.
DOCTOR: No, really, it is. It's a screwdriver, and it's sonic. Look.
MARTHA: What else have you got, a laser spanner?
DOCTOR: I did, but it was stolen by Emily Pankhurst, cheeky woman. Oh, this computer! The Judoon must have locked it down. Judoon platoon upon the moon. Because I was just travelling past. I swear, I was just wandering. I wasn't looking for trouble, honestly, I wasn't, but I noticed these plasma coils around the hospital, and that lightning, that's a plasma coil. Been building up for two days now, so I checked in. I thought something was going on inside. It turns out the plasma coils were the Judoon up above.
MARTHA: But what were they looking for?
DOCTOR: Something that looks human, but isn't.
MARTHA: Like you, apparently.
DOCTOR: Like me. But not me.
MARTHA: Haven't they got a photo?
DOCTOR: Well, might be a shape-changer.
MARTHA: Whatever it is, can't you just leave the Judoon to find it?
DOCTOR: If they declare the hospital guilty of harbouring a fugitive, they'll sentence it to execution.
MARTHA: All of us?
DOCTOR: Oh yes. If I can find this thing first. Oh! You see, they're thick! Judoon are thick! They are completely thick! They wiped the records. Oh, that's clever.
MARTHA: What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Say, any patient admitted in the past week with unusual symptoms. Maybe there's a back-up.
MARTHA: Just keep working. I'll go ask Mister Stoker. He might know.
MARTHA: Mister Stoker?
FLORENCE: Kill her!
DOCTOR: I've restored the back-up.
MARTHA: I found her.
DOCTOR: You did what?
DOCTOR: Run!
DOCTOR: When I say now, press the button.
MARTHA: But I don't know which one.
DOCTOR: Then find out!
DOCTOR: Now!
MARTHA: What did you do?
DOCTOR: Increased the radiation by five thousand per cent. Killed him dead.
MARTHA: But isn't that going to kill you?
DOCTOR: Nah, it's only roentgen radiation. We used to play with roentgen bricks in the nursery. It's safe for you to come out. I've absorbed it all. All I need to do is expel it. If I concentrate I can shake the radiation out of my body and into one spot. It's in my left shoe. Here we go, here we go. Easy does it. Out, out, out, out, out. Out, out. Ah, ah, ah, ah! It is, it is, it is, it is, it is hot. Hold on.
DOCTOR: Done.
MARTHA: You're completely mad.
DOCTOR: You're right. I look daft with one shoe.
DOCTOR: Barefoot on the moon.
MARTHA: So what is that thing? And where's it from, the planet Zovirax?
DOCTOR: It's just a Slab. They're called Slabs. Basic slave drones. See? Solid leather, all the way through. Someone has got one hell of a fetish.
MARTHA: But it was that woman, Miss Finnegan. It was working for her, just like a servant.
DOCTOR: My sonic screwdriver.
MARTHA: She was one of the patients, but
DOCTOR: Oh, no. My sonic screwdriver.
MARTHA: She had a straw like some kind of vampire.
DOCTOR: I loved my sonic screwdriver.
MARTHA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sorry.
DOCTOR: You called me Doctor.
MARTHA: Anyway? Miss Finnegan is the alien. She was drinking Mister Stoker's blood.
DOCTOR: Funny time to take a snack. You'd think she'd be hiding. Unless. No. Yes, that's it. Wait a minute. Yes! Shape-changer. Internal shape-changer. She wasn't drinking blood, she was assimilating it.
JUDOON: Prepare to be catalogued. Human.
DOCTOR: If she can assimilate Mister Stoker's blood, mimic the biology, she'll register as human. We've got to find her and show the Judoon. Come on!
JUDOON: Human.
DOCTOR: That's the thing about Slabs. They always travel in pairs.
MARTHA: What about you?
DOCTOR: What about me what?
MARTHA: Haven't you got back-up? You must have a partner or something?
DOCTOR: Oh. Humans. We're stuck on the moon running out of air with Judoon and a bloodsucking criminal, you're asking personal questions? Come on.
MARTHA: I like that. Humans. I'm still not convinced you're an alien.
JUDOON: Non-human.
MARTHA: Oh my God, you really are.
DOCTOR: And again.
DOCTOR: They've done this floor. Come on. The Judoon are logical and just a little bit thick. They won't go back to check a floor they've checked already. If we're lucky.
MARTHA: How much oxygen is there?
SWALES: Not enough for all these people. We're going to run out.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling? Are you all right?
MARTHA: I'm running on adrenaline.
DOCTOR: Welcome to my world.
MARTHA: What about the Judoon?
DOCTOR: Nah, great big lung reserves. It won't slow them down. Where's Mister Stoker's office?
MARTHA: It's this way.
MARTHA: She's gone. She was here.
DOCTOR: Drained him dry. Every last drop. I was right. She's a plasmavore.
MARTHA: What's she doing on Earth?
DOCTOR: Hiding. On the run. Like Ronald Biggs in Rio de Janeiro. What's she doing now? She's still not safe. The Judoon could execute us all. Come on.
MARTHA: Wait a minute.
DOCTOR: Think, think, think. If I was a plasmavore surrounded by police, what would I do?
DOCTOR: Ah. She's as clever as me. Almost.
JUDOON: Find the non-human. Execute.
DOCTOR: Martha, stay here. I need time. You've got to hold them up.
MARTHA: How do I do that?
DOCTOR: Just forgive me for this. It could save a thousand lives. It means nothing. Honestly, nothing.
MARTHA: That was nothing?
DOCTOR: Have you seen them? There are these things. These great big space rhino things. I mean, rhinos from space. And we're on the moon! Great big space rhinos with guns on the moon. And I only came in for my bunions, look. I mean, all fixed now. Perfectly good treatment. The nurses were lovely. I said to my wife, I said I'd recommend this place to anyone, but then we end up on the moon. And did I mention the rhinos?
FLORENCE: Hold him.
JUDOON: Find the non-human. Execute.
MARTHA: Now listen, I know who you're looking for. She's this woman. She calls herself Florence.
JUDOON: Human. Wait. Non-human traits suspected. Non-human element confirmed. Authorise full scan. What are you? What are you?
DOCTOR: Er, that, that big er machine thing. Is it supposed to be making that noise?
FLORENCE: You wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: But isn't that a magnetic resonance imaging thing? Like a ginormous sort of a magnet? I did magnetics GCSE. Well, I failed, but all the same.
FLORENCE: The magnetic setting now increased to fifty thousand Tesla.
DOCTOR: Ooo, that's a bit strong, isn't it?
FLORENCE: It'll send out a magnetic pulse that'll fry the brain stems of every living thing within two hundred and fifty thousand miles. Except for me, safe in this room.
DOCTOR: But er, hold on, hold on, I did geography GCSE. I passed that one. Doesn't that distance include the Earth?
FLORENCE: Only the side facing the moon. The other half will survive. Call it my little gift.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me, I'm a little out of my depth. I've spent the past fifteen years working as a postman. Hence the bunions. Why would you do that?
FLORENCE: With everyone dead, the Judoon ships will be mine, to make my escape.
DOCTOR: No, that's weird. You're talking like you're some sort of an alien.
FLORENCE: Quite so.
DOCTOR: No!
FLORENCE: Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: You're joshing me.
FLORENCE: I am not.
DOCTOR: I'm talking to an alien? In hospital? What, has the place got an ET department?
FLORENCE: It's the perfect hiding place. Blood banks downstairs for a midnight feast, and all this equipment ready to arm myself with should the police come looking.
DOCTOR: So, those rhinos, they're looking for you?
FLORENCE: Yes. But I'm hidden.
DOCTOR: Right. Maybe that's why they're increasing their scans.
FLORENCE: They're doing what?
DOCTOR: Big chief rhino boy, he said, no sign of a non-human, we must increase our scans up to setting two?
FLORENCE: Then I must assimilate again.
DOCTOR: What does that mean?
FLORENCE: I must appear to be human.
DOCTOR: Well, you're welcome to come home and meet the wife. She'd be honoured. We can have cake.
FLORENCE: Why should I have cake? I've got my little straw.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's nice. Milkshake? I like banana.
FLORENCE: You're quite the funny man. And yet, I think, laughing on purpose at the darkness. I think it's time you found some peace. Steady him!
DOCTOR: What are you doing?
FLORENCE: I'm afraid this is going to hurt. But if it's any consolation, the dead don't tend to remember.
JUDOON: Confirm human. Traces of facial contact with non-human. Continue the search.
JUDOON: You will need this.
MARTHA: What's that for?
JUDOON: Compensation.
FLORENCE: Now see what you've done. This poor man just died of fright.
JUDOON: Scan him. Confirmation. Deceased.
MARTHA: No, he can't be. Let me through. Let me see him.
JUDOON: Stop. Case closed.
MARTHA: But it was her. She killed him. She did it. She murdered him.
JUDOON: Judoon have no authority over human crime.
MARTHA: But she's not human.
FLORENCE: Oh, but I am. I've been catalogued.
MARTHA: But she's not! She assimi. Wait a minute. You drank his blood? The Doctor's blood? 
FLORENCE: Oh, I don't mind. Scan all you like.
JUDOON: Non-human.
FLORENCE: But, what?
JUDOON: Confirm analysis.
FLORENCE: Oh, but it's a mistake, surely. I'm human. I'm as human as they come.
MARTHA: He gave his life so they'd find you.
JUDOON: Confirm. Plasmavore, charged with the crime of murdering the child princess of Patrival Regency Nine.
FLORENCE: Well, she deserved it! Those pink cheeks and those blonde curls and that simpering voice. She was begging for the bite of a plasmavore.
JUDOON: Then you confess?
FLORENCE: Confess? I'm proud of it! Slab, stop them!
JUDOON: Verdict, guilty. Sentence, execution.
FLORENCE: Enjoy your victory, Judoon, because you're going to burn with me. Burn in hell!
JUDOON: Case closed.
MARTHA: But what did she mean, burn with me? The scanner shouldn't be doing that. She's done something.
JUDOON: Scans detect lethal acceleration of monomagnetic pulse.
MARTHA: Well, do something! Stop it!
JUDOON: Our jurisdiction has ended. Judoon will evacuate.
MARTHA: What? You can't just leave it. What's it going to do?
JUDOON: All units withdraw.
MORGENSTERN: What about the air? We're running out of air.
MARTHA: You can't go! That thing's going to explode and it's your fault!
MARTHA: One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Two hearts! One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five.
MARTHA: The scanner. She did something.
DOCTOR: Soddit.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on, come on, come on, please. Come on, Judoon, reverse it.
DOCTOR: It's raining, Martha. It's raining on the moon.
MORGENSTERN: I told them I represented the human race. I told them, you can't do that. I said, we have rights.
TISH: Martha! Oh, God! I thought you were dead! What happened? It was so weird, because the police wouldn't say. They didn't have a clue. And I tried phoning. Mum's on her way, but she can't get through. They've closed off all the roads.
TISH: There's thousands of people trying to get in. The whole city's come to a halt. And Dad phoned, because it's on the news and everything. He was crying.
TISH: Oh, what a mess. What happened? I mean, what really happened? Where were you?
RADIO: Eyewitness reports from the Royal Hope Hospital continue to pour in, and it all seems to be remarkably consistent. This from medical student Oliver Morgenstern.
MORGENSTERN : I was there. I saw it happen. And I feel uniquely privileged. I looked out at the surface of the moon. I saw the Earth, suspended in space, and it all just proves Mister Saxon right. We're not alone in the universe. There's life out there. Wild and extraordinary life.
ANNALISE: I am not staying in there to be insulted!
CLIVE: She didn't mean it, sweetheart. She was just saying you look healthy.
FRANCINE: No, I did not. I said orange.
ANNALISE: Clive, that woman is disrespecting me. She's never liked me.
FRANCINE: Oh, I can't think why, after you stole my husband.
ANNALISE: I was seduced. I'm entirely innocent. Tell her, babe.
FRANCINE: And then she has a go at Martha, practically accused her of making the whole thing up.
MARTHA: Mum, I don't mind. Just leave it.
ANNALISE: Oh. I've been to the moon! As if. They were drugged. It said so on the news.
FRANCINE: Since when did you watch the news? You can't handle Quiz Mania.
TISH: Annalise started it. She did. I heard her.
LEO: Tish, don't make it worse.
TISH: Oh, come off it, Leo. What did she buy you? Soap. A seventy five pence soap.
ANNALISE: Oh, I'm never talking to your family again!
FRANCINE: Oh, stay. Have a night out with Clive.
CLIVE: Don't you dare. I'm putting my foot down.
ANNALISE: You coming?
CLIVE: This is me, putting my foot down.
FRANCINE: Doing it for the last twenty five years!
CLIVE: Please.
FRANCINE: Clive, stop, now!
TISH: Mum, don't. I
MARTHA: I went to the moon today.
DOCTOR: A bit more peaceful than down here.
MARTHA: You never even told me who you are.
DOCTOR: The Doctor.
MARTHA: What sort of species? It's not every day I get to ask that.
DOCTOR: I'm a Time Lord.
MARTHA: Right! Not pompous at all, then.
DOCTOR: I just thought since you saved my life and I've got a brand new sonic screwdriver which needs road testing, you might fancy a trip.
MARTHA: What, into space?
DOCTOR: Well.
MARTHA: But I can't. I've got exams. I've got things to do. I have to go into town first thing and pay the rent, I've got my family going mad.
DOCTOR: If it helps, I can travel in time as well.
MARTHA: Get out of here.
DOCTOR: I can.
MARTHA: Come on now, that's going too far.
DOCTOR: I'll prove it.
DOCTOR: Told you.
MARTHA: No, but, that was this morning. Did you? Oh, my God. You can travel in time. But hold on. If you could see me this morning, why didn't you tell me not to go in to work?
DOCTOR: Crossing into established events is strictly forbidden. Except for cheap tricks.
MARTHA: And that's your spaceship?
DOCTOR: It's called the Tardis. Time and Relative Dimension in Space.
MARTHA: Your spaceship's made of wood. There's not much room. We'd be a bit intimate.
DOCTOR: Take a look.
MARTHA: No, no, no.
MARTHA: But it's just a box. But it's huge.
MARTHA: How does it do that? It's wood. It's like a box with that room just rammed in. It's bigger on the inside.
DOCTOR: Is it? I hadn't noticed.
DOCTOR: Right then, let's get going.
MARTHA: But is there a crew, like a navigator and stuff? Where is everyone?
DOCTOR: Just me.
MARTHA: All on your own?
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes I have guests. I mean some friends, travelling alongside. I had. There was recently, a friend of mine. Rose, her name was. Rose. And we were together. Anyway.
MARTHA: Where is she now?
DOCTOR: With her family. Happy. She's fine. She's. Not that you're replacing her.
MARTHA: Never said I was.
DOCTOR: Just one trip to say thanks. You get one trip, then back home. I'd rather be on my own.
MARTHA: You're the one that kissed me.
DOCTOR: That was a genetic transfer.
MARTHA: And if you will wear a tight suit.
DOCTOR: Now, don't!
MARTHA: And then travel all the way across the universe just to ask me on a date.
DOCTOR: Stop it.
MARTHA: For the record? I'm not remotely interested. I only go for humans.
DOCTOR: Good. Well, then. Close down the gravitic anomaliser, fire up the helmic regulator. And finally, the hand brake. Ready?
MARTHA: No.
DOCTOR: Off we go.
MARTHA: Blimey, it's a bit bumpy.
DOCTOR: Welcome aboard, Miss Jones.
MARTHA: It's my pleasure, Mister Smith.
