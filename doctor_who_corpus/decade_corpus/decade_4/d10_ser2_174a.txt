The Impossible Planet
DOCTOR: I don't know what's wrong though. She's sort of queasy. Indigestion, like she didn't want to land.
ROSE: Oh, if you think there's going to be trouble, we could always get back inside and go somewhere else.
DOCTOR: I think we've landed inside a cupboard. Here we go.
COMPUTER: Open door 15.
DOCTOR: Some sort of base. Moon base, sea base, space base. They build these things out of kits.
COMPUTER: Close door 15.
ROSE: Glad we're indoors. sounds like a storm out there.
COMPUTER: Open door 16.
DOCTOR: Human design. You've got a thing about kits. This place was put together like a flat pack wardrobe, only bigger. And easier.
COMPUTER: Open door 17.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a sanctuary base.
COMPUTER: Close door 17.
DOCTOR: Deep Space exploration. We've gone way out. And listen to that, underneath. Someone's drilling.
ROSE: Welcome to hell.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not that bad.
ROSE: No, over there.
DOCTOR: Hold on, what does that say? That's weird, it won't translate.
ROSE: But I thought the Tardis translated everything, writing as well. We should see English.
DOCTOR: Exactly. If that's not working, then it means this writing is old. Very old. Impossibly old. We should find out who's in charge.
DOCTOR: We've gone beyond the reach of the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move. And if someone's lucky enough
COMPUTER: Open door 19.
DOCTOR: Oh! Right. Hello. Sorry. I was just saying, er, nice base.
ALL OOD: We must feed.
DOCTOR: You've got to what?
ALL OOD: We must feed.
ROSE: Yeah. I think they mean us.
ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed.
ALL OOD: We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed. We must feed.
OOD: We must feed.
OOD: You, if you are hungry.
DOCTOR: Sorry?
OOD: We apologise. Electromagnetics have interfered with speech systems. Would you like some refreshment?
DOCTOR: Er
COMPUTER: Open door 18.
JEFFERSON: What the hell? How did?
JEFFERSON: Captain, you're not going to believe this. We've got people. Out of nowhere. I mean, real people. I mean two living people, just standing here right in front of me.
ZACH : Don't be stupid, that's impossible.
JEFFERSON: I suggest telling them that.
ROSE: But you're a sort of space base. You must have visitors now and then. It can't be that impossible.
JEFFERSON: You're telling me you don't know where you are?
DOCTOR: No idea. More fun that way.
SCOOTI : Stand by, everyone. Buckle down. We have incoming. And it's a big one. Quake point five on its way.
JEFFERSON: Through here, now. Quickly, come on! Move!
JEFFERSON: Move it! Come on! Keep moving. Come on! Quickly! Move it!
ZACH: Oh, my God. You meant it.
SCOOTI: People! Look at that, real people!
DOCTOR: That's us. Hooray!
ROSE: Yeah, definitely real. My name's Rose. Rose Tyler. And, and this is the Doctor.
DANNY: Come on the oxygen must be offline. We're hallucinating. They can't be. No, they're real.
ZACH: Come on, we're in the middle of an alert! Danny, strap up. The quake's coming in! Impact in thirty seconds! Sorry you two, whoever you are. Just hold on, tight.
ROSE: Hold on to what?
ZACH: Anything. I don't care. Just hold on. Ood, are we fixed?
OOD: Your kindness in this emergency is much appreciated.
DOCTOR: What's this planet called, anyway?
IDA: Now, don't be stupid. It hasn't got a name. How could it have a name? You really don't know, do you?
ZACH: And impact!
DOCTOR: Oh, well, that wasn't so bad.
ZACH: Okay, that's it. Everyone all right? Speak to me, Ida.
IDA: Yeah, yeah!
ZACH: Danny?
DANNY: Fine.
ZACH: Toby?
TOBY: Yeah, fine.
ZACH: Scooti?
SCOOTI: No damage.
ZACH: Jefferson?
JEFFERSON: Check!
DOCTOR: We're fine, thanks, fine. Yeah, don't worry about us.
ZACH: The surface caved in.
ZACH: I deflected it onto storage five through eight. We've lost them completely. Toby, go and check the rocket link.
TOBY: That's not my department.
ZACH: Just do as I say, yeah?
IDA: Oxygen holding. Internal gravity fifty six point six. We should be okay.
ROSE: Never mind the earthquake, that's, that's one hell of a storm. What is that, a hurricane?
SCOOTI: You'd need an atmosphere for a hurricane. There's no air out there. It's a complete vacuum.
ROSE: Then what's shaking the roof?
IDA: You're not joking. You really don't know. Well introductions. F Y I, as they said in the olden days. I'm Ida Scott, science officer. Zachary Cross Flane, acting Captain, sir. You've met Mister Jefferson, he's Head of Security. Danny Bartock, Ethics committee.
DANNY: Not as boring as it sounds.
IDA: And that man who just left, that was Toby Zed, Archaeology, and this is Scooti Manista, Trainee maintenance. And this? This is home.
ZACH: Brace yourselves. The sight of it sends some people mad.
ROSE: That's a black hole.
DOCTOR: But that's impossible.
ZACH: I did warn you.
DOCTOR: We're standing under a black hole.
IDA: In orbit.
DOCTOR: But we can't be
IDA: You can see for yourself. We're in orbit.
DOCTOR: But we can't be.
IDA: This lump of rock is suspended in perpetual geostationary orbit around that black hole without falling in. Discuss.
ROSE: And that's bad, yeah?
DOCTOR: Bad doesn't cover it. A black hole's a dead star. It collapses in on itself, in and in and in until the matter's so dense and tight it starts to pull everything else in too. Nothing in the universe can escape it. Light, gravity, time. Everything just gets pulled inside and crushed.
ROSE: So, they can't be in orbit. We should be pulled right in.
DOCTOR: We should be dead.
IDA: And yet here we are, beyond the laws of physics. Welcome on board.
ROSE: But if there's no atmosphere out there, what's that?
IDA: Stars breaking up. Gas clouds. We have whole solar systems being ripped apart above our heads, before falling into that thing.
ROSE: So, a bit worse than a storm, then.
IDA: Just a bit.
ROSE: Just a bit, yeah.
VOICE : Toby.
TOBY: Who's that? Danny?
COMPUTER: Close door 1.
TOBY: The rocket link's fine.
ZACH: That's the black hole, officially designated K three seven Gen five.
IDA: In the scriptures of the Falltino, this planet is called Kroptor, the bitter pill. And the black hole is supposed to be a mighty demon. It was tricked into devouring the planet, only to spit it out, because it was poison.
ROSE: The bitter pill. I like that.
DOCTOR: We are so far out. Lost in the drifts of the universe. How did you even get here?!
ZACH: We flew in. You see, this planet's generating a gravity field. We don't know how. We've no idea. But it's kept in constant balance against the black hole. And the field extends out there as a funnel. A distinct gravity funnel, reaching out into clear space. That was our way in.
ROSE: You flew down that thing? Like a rollercoaster.
ZACH: By rights, the ship should have been torn apart. We lost the Captain, which is what put me in charge.
IDA: You're doing a good job.
ZACH: Yeah, well, needs must.
DANNY: But if that gravity funnel closes, there's no way out.
SCOOTI: We had fun speculating about that.
DANNY: Oh, yeah. That's the word. Fun.
DOCTOR: But that field would take phenomenal amounts of power. I mean not just big, but off the scale! Can I?
IDA: Sure. Help yourself.
OOD: Your refreshment.
ROSE: Oh, yeah. Thanks. Thank you. I'm sorry, what was your name?
OOD: We have no titles. We are as one.
ROSE: Er, what are they called?
DANNY: Oh, come on. Where have you been living? Everyone's got one.
ROSE: Well, not me, so, what are they?
DANNY: They're the Ood.
ROSE: The Ood?
DANNY: The Ood.
ROSE: Well that's ood.
DANNY: Very ood, but handy. They work the mine shafts. All the drilling and stuff. Supervision and maintenance. They're born for it. Basic slave race.
ROSE: You've got slaves?
SCOOTI: Don't start. She's like one of that lot. Friends of the Ood.
ROSE: Well maybe I am, yeah. Since when do humans need slaves?
DANNY: But the Ood offer themselves. If you don't give them orders, they just pine away and die.
ROSE: Seriously, you like being ordered about?
OOD: It is all we crave.
ROSE: Why's that, then?
OOD: We have nothing else in life.
ROSE: Yeah, well, I used to think like that, a long time ago.
DOCTOR: There we go. Do you see? To generate that gravity field, and the funnel, you'd need a power source with an inverted self extrapolating reflex of six to the power of six every six seconds.
ROSE: That's a lot of sixes.
DOCTOR: And it's impossible.
ZACH: It took us two years to work that out
DOCTOR: I'm very good.
IDA: But that's why we're here. This power source is ten miles below through solid rock. Point Zero. We're drilling down to try and find it.
ZACH: It's giving off readings of over ninety stats on the Blazon scale.
IDA: It could revolutionise modern science.
JEFFERSON: We could use it to fuel the Empire.
DOCTOR: Or start a war.
TOBY: It's buried beneath us, in the darkness, waiting.
ROSE: What's your job, chief dramatist?
TOBY: Well, whatever it is down there is not a natural phenomena. And this, er, planet once supported life eons ago, before the human race had even learned to walk.
DOCTOR: I saw that lettering written on the wall. Did you do that?
TOBY: I copied it from fragments we found unearthed by the drilling, but I can't translate it.
DOCTOR: No, neither can I. And that's saying something.
TOBY: There was some form of civilisation. They buried something. Now it's reaching out, calling us in.
DOCTOR: And you came.
IDA: Well, how could we not?
DOCTOR: So, when it comes right down to it, why did you come here? Why did you do that? Why? I'll tell you why. Because it was there. Brilliant. Excuse me, er, Zach, wasn't it?
ZACH: That's me.
DOCTOR: Just stand there, because I'm going to hug you. Is that all right?
ZACH: I suppose so.
DOCTOR: Here we go. Come on, then.
DOCTOR: Oh, human beings. You are amazing! Ha! Thank you.
ZACH: Not at all.
DOCTOR: But apart from that, you're completely mad. You should pack your bags, get back in that ship and fly for your lives.
IDA: You can talk. And how the hell did you get here?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got this er, this ship. It's hard to explain. It just sort of appears.
ROSE: We can show you, we parked down the corridor from er. Oh, what's it called? Habitation area
DOCTOR: Three.
ROSE: Three. Three.
ZACH: Do you mean storage six?
DOCTOR: It was a bit of a cupboard, yeah. Storage six. But you said. You said. You said storage five to eight.
ROSE: What is it? What's wrong?
COMPUTER: Open door 19. Close door 19.
DOCTOR: Open the door! Come on!
COMPUTER: Open door 17.
COMPUTER: Open door 15. Door 16 out of commission.
DOCTOR: It can't be. It can't be!
ROSE: What's wrong? What is it? Doctor, the Tardis is in there. What's happened?
DOCTOR: The Tardis is gone.
COMPUTER: Door 16 out of commission.
DOCTOR: The earthquake. This section collapsed.
ROSE: But it's got to be out there somewhere.
DOCTOR: Look down.
DOCTOR: The ground gave way. My Tardis must've fallen down right into the heart of the planet. But you've got robot drills heading the same way.
ZACH: We can't divert the drilling.
DOCTOR: But I need my ship. It's all I've got. Literally the only thing.
ZACH: Doctor, we've only got the resources to drill one central shaft down to the power source, and that's it. No diversions, no distractions, no exceptions. Your machine is lost. All I can do is offer you a lift if we ever get to leave this place, and that is the end of it.
IDA: I'll er, put you on the duty roster. We need someone in the laundry.
COMPUTER: Open door 1. Close door 1.
DOCTOR: I've trapped you here.
ROSE: No, don't worry about me.
ROSE: Okay, we're on a planet that shouldn't exist, under a black hole and no way out. Yeah, I've changed my mind. Start worrying about me.
COMPUTER: Entering night shift. Your chosen track for transition is Ravel's Bolero.
SCOOTI: All finished. Coming back inside.
DANNY: Ood 7 Gamma 10. Ood 7 Gamma 11. Ood 7 Gamma 12.
VOICE : Toby. I can see you
TOBY: Danny, is that you? It's, it's not funny, all right? Dan?
TOBY: I'm. I'm trying to work, Daniel. Look, if, if that's you, then can you just stop it ?
ZACH : Danny, check the temperature in Ood Habitation. It seems to be rising.
SCOOTI: Help yourself. Just don't have the green. Or the blue.
ROSE: Er, bit of that, thanks.
OOD: Would you like sauce with that?
ROSE: I'll have a go, yeah. I did that job once. I was a, a dinner lady. Not that I'm calling you a lady. Although, I don't know, you might be. Do you actually get paid, though? Do they give you money?
OOD: The Beast and his Armies shall rise from the Pit to make war against God.
ROSE: I'm sorry?
OOD: Apologies. I said, I hope you enjoy your meal.
ROSE: Yeah.
COMPUTER: Drill head now at point sixteen. Drill head speed increasing.
ZACH: Keep pressure at sixty.
COMPUTER: Close door 3.
DANNY: I've closed door 3.
COMPUTER: He is awake.
DANNY: What did you say?
COMPUTER: Close door 3.
VOICE : Toby. Don't turn around.
TOBY: Dan? That's not Dan.
VOICE : Don't look at me.
TOBY: Who are you?
VOICE : I have so many names.
TOBY: If if I could
VOICE : If you look at me, you will die.
TOBY: But who are you?
VOICE : I'm behind you, Toby. I'm right behind you. Don't look. Don't look at me. One look and you will die. I'm reaching out, Toby. I'm so close. Don't turn around. Oh, I can touch you.
 IDA: Zach? Have we got a problem?
ZACH : No more than usual. Got the Scarlet System burning up. Might be worth a look.
IDA: You might want to see this. Moment in history.
IDA: There. On the edge. That red cloud. That used to be the Scarlet System. Home to the Peluchi, a mighty civilisation spanning a billion years, disappearing forever. Their planets and suns consumed. Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed its passing.
DOCTOR: Er, no, could you leave it open? Just for a bit. I won't go mad, I promise.
IDA: How would you know? Scooti, check the lockdown. Jefferson, sign off the airlock seals for me.
COMPUTER: Open door 18.
ROSE: I've seen films and things, yeah. They say black holes are like gateways to another universe.
COMPUTER: Close door 18.
DOCTOR: Not that one. It just eats.
ROSE: Long way from home.
DOCTOR: Go that way, turn right, keep going for er, about, er, five hundred years, and you'll reach the Earth.
ROSE: No signal. That's the first time we've gone out of range. Mind you, even if I could. What would I tell her? Can you build another Tardis?
DOCTOR: They were grown, not built. And with my own planet gone, we're kind of stuck.
ROSE: Well, it could be worse. This lot said they'd give us a lift.
DOCTOR: And then what?
ROSE: I don't know. Find a planet, get a job, live a life, same as the rest of the universe.
DOCTOR: I'd have to settle down. Get a house or something. A proper house with, with doors and things. Carpets. Me, living in a house. Now that, that is terrifying.
ROSE: You'd have to get a mortgage.
DOCTOR: No.
ROSE: Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: I'm dying. That's it. I'm dying. It is all over.
ROSE: What about me? I'd have to get one, too. I don't know, could be the same one. We could both, I don't know, share. Or not, you know. Whatever. I don't know. We'll sort something out
DOCTOR: Anyway.
ROSE: We'll see.
DOCTOR: I promised Jackie I'd always take you back home.
ROSE: Everyone leaves home in the end.
DOCTOR: Not to end up stuck here.
ROSE: Yeah, but stuck with you, that's not so bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah?
ROSE: Yes.
VOICE : He is awake.
DOCTOR: Evening.
ROSE: Only us.
DANNY: The mysterious couple. How are you, then? Settling in?
DOCTOR: Yeah. Sorry, straight to business, the Ood how do they communicate? I mean, with each other.
DANNY: Oh, just empaths. There's a low level telepathic field connecting them. Not that that does them much good. They're basically a herd race. Like cattle.
DOCTOR: This telepathic field. Can it pick up messages?
ROSE: Because I was having dinner, and one of the Ood said something, well, odd.
DANNY: Hmm. An odd Ood.
ROSE: And then I got something else on my er, communicator thing.
DANNY: Oh, be fair. We've got whole star systems burning up around us. There's all sorts of stray transmissions. Probably nothing. Look, if there was something wrong, it would show. We monitor the telepathic field. It's the only way to look after them. They're so stupid, they don't even tell us when they're ill.
DOCTOR: Monitor the field. That's this thing?
DANNY: Yeah. But like I said, it's low level telepathy. They only register basic five.
DOCTOR: Well, that's not basic five. Ten, twenty. They've gone up to basic thirty.
DANNY: But they can't.
ROSE: Doctor, the Ood. What does basic thirty mean?
DANNY: Well, it means that they're shouting, screaming inside their heads.
DOCTOR: Or something's shouting at them.
DANNY: But where is it coming from? What is it saying? What did it say to you?
ROSE: Something about the beast in the pit.
DANNY: What about your communicator? What did that say?
ROSE: He is awake.
ALL OOD: And you will worship him.
DANNY: What the hell?
DOCTOR: He is awake.
ALL OOD: And you will worship him.
DOCTOR: Worship who?  Who's talking to you? Who is it?
SCOOTI: Toby, I've got your expenditure
COMPUTER: Open door 41. Close door 41.
SCOOTI: Forty one?
COMPUTER: Close Door 40.
SCOOTI: Computer, did you open and close door 41?
COMPUTER: Confirmed.
SCOOTI: But that's the airlock. Why would you open the airlock? It's the night shift. We're not allowed outside. Has someone gone out?
COMPUTER: Confirmed.
SCOOTI: But who was it?
COMPUTER: Cannot confirm.
SCOOTI: Okay. But hold on. I know. Tell me whose spacesuit's been logged out.
COMPUTER: No spacesuit has been logged out.
SCOOTI: But you're not making any sense. You can't go outside without. Zach, I think we've got breakdown on door 41. It's saying somebody's gone outside onto the planet's surface. Zach? Zach! Computer, trace fault.
COMPUTER: There is no fault.
SCOOTI: Tell me who went through that door.
COMPUTER: He is awake.
SCOOTI: What?
COMPUTER: He is awake.
SCOOTI: What's that supposed to mean?
COMPUTER: He bathes in the black sun.
SCOOTI: Toby. But there's no air, there's no
SCOOTI: No! Stop it! You can't be!
SCOOTI: Open door 40! Open door 40! Open door 40! Open door 40! Open door 40!
COMPUTER: Emergency hull breach. Emergency hull breach.
DANNY: Which section?
ZACH: Everyone, evacuate eleven to thirteen. We've got a breach. The base is open. Repeat, the base is open!
COMPUTER: Open door 19.
COMPUTER: Close door 19.
ZACH: I can't contain the oxygen field. We're going to lose it.
JEFFERSON: Come on! Keep moving!
JEFFERSON: And you too, Toby!
COMPUTER: Breach sealed. Breach sealed.
DOCTOR: Everyone all right?! What happened? What was it?
COMPUTER: Oxygen levels normal.
JEFFERSON: Hull breach. We were open to the elements. Another couple of minutes and we'd have been inspecting that black hole at close quarters.
DOCTOR: That wasn't a quake. What caused it?
ZACH: We've lost sections eleven to thirteen Everyone all right?
JEFFERSON: We've got everyone here except Scooti. Scooti, report. Scooti Manista? That's an order. Report.
ZACH : She's all right. I've picked up her biochip. She's in
ZACH: Habitation three. Better go and check if she's not responding. She might be unconscious.
ZACH: How about that, eh? We survived.
JEFFERSON: Habitation three. Come on. I don't often say this, but I think we could all do with a drink. Come on.
DOCTOR: What happened?
TOBY: I don't. I don't know. I was working and then I can't remember. All that noise. The room was falling apart. There was no air
ROSE: Come on. Up you get. Come and have some protein one.
DOCTOR: Oh, you've gone native.
ROSE: Oi, don't knock it. It's nice. Protein one with just a dash of three.
IDA: I've checked Habitation four. Can you hear me?
JEFFERSON: There's no sign of her. The biochip says she's in the area. Have any of you seen Scooti?
TOBY: No, no, no, I don't think so.
IDA: Scooti, please respond. If you can hear this, please respond. Habitation six.
JEFFERSON: Nowhere here. Zach? We've got a problem. Scooti's still missing.
ZACH : It says Habitation three.
JEFFERSON: Yeah, well, that's where I am, and I'm telling you she's not here.
DOCTOR: I've found her.
ROSE: Oh, my God.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
JEFFERSON: Captain. Report Officer Scootori Manista PKD, deceased. Forty three K two point one.
IDA: She was twenty. Twenty years old.
JEFFERSON: For how should man die better than facing fearful odds? For the ashes of his father and the temples of his Gods.
IDA: It's stopped.
ROSE: What was that? What was it?
DOCTOR: The drill.
IDA: We've stopped drilling. We've made it. Point Zero.
ZACH : All non essential Oods to be confined.
IDA: Capsule established. All systems functioning. The mineshaft is go. Bring systems online now.
DOCTOR: Reporting as a volunteer for the expeditionary force.
ZACH: Doctor, this is breaking every single protocol. We don't even know who you are.
DOCTOR: Yeah, but you trust me, don't you? And you can't let Ida go down there on her own. Go on. Look me in the eye. Yes you do, I can see it. Trust.
ZACH: I should be going down.
DOCTOR: The Captain doesn't lead the mission. He stays here, in charge.
ZACH: Not much good at it, am I? Positions! We're going down in two. Everyone, positions! Mister Jefferson! I want maximum system enhancement.
DOCTOR: Oxygen, nitro balance, gravity. It's ages since I wore one of these.
ROSE: I want that spacesuit back in one piece, you got that?
DOCTOR: Yes, sir.
ROSE: It's funny, because people back home think that space travel's going to be all whizzing about and teleports and anti gravity, but it's not, is it? It's tough.
DOCTOR: I'll see you later.
ROSE: Not if I see you first.
DANNY: You will remain here. No command can override this. Have you got that? My instructions only.
ZACH: Capsule active. Counting down in ten, nine
ZACH : Eight, seven, six
ZACH : Five, four, three, two, one. Release.
ZACH: You've gone beyond the oxygen field. You're on your own.
ROSE: Don't forget to breath. Breathing's good.
ZACH: Rose, stay off the comm.
ROSE: No chance.
ROSE: Doctor? Doctor, are you all right?
ZACH: Ida, report to me. Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's all right. We've made it. Getting out of the capsule now.
ROSE : What's it like down there?
DOCTOR: It's hard to tell. Some sort of cave. Cavern. It's massive.
IDA: Well, this should help. Gravity globe.
IDA: That's, that's. My God, that's beautiful.
DOCTOR: Rose, you can tell Toby we've found his civilisation
ROSE: Oi, Toby. Sounds like you've got plenty of work.
TOBY: Good, good. Good.
ZACH: Concentrate now, people. Keep on the mission. Ida, what about the power source?
IDA: We're close. Energy signature indicates north north west. Are you getting pictures up there?
ZACH : There's too much interference. We're in your hands.
IDA: Well, we've come this far. There's no turning back.
DOCTOR: Oh, did you have to? No turning back? That's almost as bad as nothing can possible go wrong, or this is going to be the best Christmas Walford's ever had.
IDA: Are you finished?
DOCTOR: Yeah. Finished.
DANNY: Captain, sir. There's something happening with the Ood.
ZACH: What are they doing?
DANNY: They're staring at me. I've told them to stop, but they won't.
ZACH : Danny, you're a big boy.
ZACH: I think you can take being stared at.
DANNY: But the telepathic field, sir. It's at basic one hundred. I've checked. there isn't any fault. It's definitely one hundred.
ZACH : But that's impossible.
ROSE: What's basic one hundred mean?
DANNY: They should be dead.
JEFFERSON: Basic one hundred's brain death.
ZACH: But they're safe. They're not actually moving?
DANNY: No, sir.
ZACH: Keep watching them. And you, Jefferson?
ZACH : Keep a guard on the Ood.
JEFFERSON: Officer at arms!
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.
ROSE: You can't fire a gun in here. What if you hit a wall?
JEFFERSON: I'm firing stock fifteen. It only impacts upon organics. Keep watch. Guard them.
GUARD: Yes, sir.
DOCTOR : Is everything all right up there?
ROSE: Yeah, yeah.
ZACH: It's fine.
DANNY: Great.
DOCTOR: We've found something. It looks like metal. Like some sort of seal. I've got a nasty feeling the word might be trapdoor. Not a good word, trapdoor. Never met a trapdoor I liked.
IDA: The edge is covered with those symbols.
ZACH : Do you think it opens?
DOCTOR: That's what trapdoors tend to do.
IDA: Trapdoor doesn't do it justice. It's massive, Zach. About thirty feet in diameter.
ZACH : Any way of opening it?
IDA: I don't know. I can't see any sort of mechanism.
DOCTOR: I suppose that's the writing. It'll tell us what to do. The letters that defy translation.
ZACH: Toby, did you get anywhere with decoding it?
ROSE: Toby, they need to know that lettering. Does it make any sort of sense?
TOBY: I know what it says.
ROSE: Then tell them.
JEFFERSON: When did you work that out?
ROSE: It doesn't matter, just tell them.
TOBY: These are the words of the Beast. And he has woken. He is the heart that beats in the darkness. He is the blood that will never cease. And now he will rise.
JEFFERSON: Officer, stand down. Stand down.
DOCTOR: What is it? What's he done? What's happening? Rose, what's going on?
ZACH: Jefferson? Report. Report!
JEFFERSON: Officer, as Commander of Security, I order you to stand down and be confined. Immediately!
ROSE: He's come out in those symbols all over his face. They're all over him.
TOBY: Mister Jefferson. Tell me, sir. Did your wife ever forgive you?
JEFFERSON: I don't know what you mean.
TOBY: Let me tell you a secret. She never did.
JEFFERSON: Officer, you stand down and be confined.
TOBY: Or what?
JEFFERSON: Or under the strictures of Condition Red, I am authorised to shoot you.
TOBY: But how many can you kill?
ALL OOD: We are the Legion of the Beast.
DOCTOR: Rose? What is it, Rose? I'm going back up.
ZACH : Report. Report!
ZACH: Jefferson, report. Someone, report!
ALL OOD: The Legion shall be many, and the Legion shall be few.
ROSE: It's the Ood.
JEFFERSON: Sir, we have contamination in the livestock.
ROSE: Doctor, I don't know what it is. It's like they're possessed.
JEFFERSON: They won't listen to us.
