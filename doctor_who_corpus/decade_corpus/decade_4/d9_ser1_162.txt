The Long Game
WOMAN : Solar flare activity has increased across space lanes five, five, six and all commercial flights are advised to avoid
DOCTOR: So, it's two hundred thousand, and it's a spaceship. No, wait a minute, space station, and er, go and try that gate over there. Off you go.
ROSE: Two hundred thousand?
DOCTOR: Two hundred thousand.
ROSE: Right.
ROSE: Adam? Out you come.
ADAM: Oh, my God.
ROSE: Don't worry, you'll get used to it.
ADAM: Where are we?
ROSE: Good question. Let's see. So, er, judging by the architecture, I'd say we're around the year two hundred thousand. If you listen
ADAM: Yeah.
ROSE: Engines. We're on some sort of space station. Yeah, definitely a space station. It's a bit warm in here. They could turn the heating down. Tell you what - let's try that gate. Come on!
ROSE: Here we go! And this is. I'll let the Doctor describe it.
DOCTOR: The Fourth great and bountiful Human Empire. And there it is, planet Earth at it's height. Covered with mega-cities, five moons, population ninety six billion. The hub of a galactic domain stretching across a million planets, a million species, with mankind right in the middle.
DOCTOR: He's your boyfriend.
ROSE: Not anymore.
 
DOCTOR: Come on, Adam. Open your mind. You're going to like this. Fantastic period of history. The human race at its most intelligent. Culture, art, politics. This era has got fine food, good manners.
MAN: Out of the way!
CHEF: Thank you very much indeed. Somebody there? That's great. What do you want, love? All right, keep moving. I'll be with you lot in a minute. Here you are. One at a time. What now, what was it? Kronkburger with cheese, kronkburger with pajatos. Do you want a drink? Oi, you, mate. Stop pushing. Get back. I said, back.
ROSE: Fine cuisine?
DOCTOR: My watch must be wrong. No, it's fine. It's weird.
ROSE: That's what comes of showing off. Your history's not as good as you thought it was.
DOCTOR: My history's perfect.
ROSE: Well, obviously not.
ADAM: They're all human. What about the millions of planets, the millions of species? Where are they?
DOCTOR: Good question. Actually, that is a good question. Adam, me old mate, you must be starving.
ADAM: No, I'm just a bit time sick.
DOCTOR: No, you just need a bit of grub. Oi, mate - how much is a kronkburger?
CHEF: Two credits twenty, sweetheart. Now join the queue.
DOCTOR: Money. We need money. Let's use a cashpoint.
TANNOY: Attention all staff. All coverage of the Glasgow water riots being transferred five through nine.
DOCTOR: There you go, pocket money. Don't spend it all on sweets.
ADAM: How does it work?
DOCTOR: Go and find out. Stop nagging me. The thing is, Adam, time travel's like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guide book, you've got to throw yourself in. Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers. Or is that just me? Stop asking questions, go and do it. Off you go, then. Your first date.
ROSE: You're going to get a smack, you are.
DOCTOR: Er, this is going to sound daft, but can you tell me where I am?
CATHICA: Floor One Three Nine. Could they write it any bigger?
DOCTOR: Floor one three nine of what?
CATHICA: Must've been a hell of a party.
SUKI: You're on Satellite Five.
DOCTOR: What's Satellite Five.
CATHICA: Come on, how could you get on board without knowing where you are?
DOCTOR: Look at me. I'm stupid.
SUKI: Hold on, wait a minute. Are you a test? Some sort of management test kind of thing?
DOCTOR: You've got me. Well done. You're too clever for me.
SUKI: We were warned about this in basic training. All workers have to be versed in company promotion.
CATHICA: Right, fire away, ask your questions. If it gets me to Floor five hundred I'll do anything.
DOCTOR: Why, what happens on Floor five hundred?
CATHICA: The walls are made of gold. And you should know, Mister Management. So, this is what we do.
CATHICA: Latest news, sandstorms on the new Venus archipelago. Two hundred dead. Glasgow water riots into their third day. Space lane seventy seven closed by sunspot activity. And over on the Bad Wolf channel, the Face of Bo has just announced he's pregnant.
DOCTOR: I get it. You broadcast the news.
CATHICA: We are the news. We're the journalists. We write it, package it and sell it. Six hundred channels
CATHICA : All coming out of Satellite Five, broadcasting everywhere.
EDITOR: Something is wrong. Something fictional. Those people.
CATHICA: Nothing happens in the whole human empire without it going though us.
EDITOR: Security check. Go deep.
TANNOY: All staff are reminded that the canteen area now operates a self cleaning table system. Thank you!
ROSE: Try this. It's called Zaphic. It's nice, it's like a, er, Slush Puppy.
ADAM: What flavour?
ROSE: Sort of beef?
ADAM: Oh, my God. It's like everything's gone, home, family, everything.
ROSE: This helps. The Doctor gave it a bit of a top-up. Who's back home, your mum and dad?
ADAM: Yeah.
ROSE: Phone them up.
ADAM: But that's one hundred and ninety eight thousand years ago.
ROSE: Honestly, try it. Go on.
ADAM: Is there a code for planet Earth?
ROSE: Just dial.
MACHINE: I'm sorry we're not in. Please leave a message. Thanks. Bye
ADAM: It's er. Hi. It's me.
ADAM: I've sort of gone travelling. I met these people and we've gone travelling together.
ADAM: But, er, I'm fine, and I'll call you later. Love you. Bye. That is so
DOCTOR: Oi! Mutt and Jeff! Over here!
COMPUTER: Security check cleared.
EDITOR: No, something's wrong. I can taste it. A tiny little shift in the information. Someone down there shouldn't be here. Double check. Triple check. Follow them.
CATHICA: Now, everybody behave. We have a management inspection. How do you want it, by the book?
DOCTOR: Right from scratch, thanks.
CATHICA: Okay. So, ladies, gentlemen, multi-sex, undecided or robot,- my name is Cathica Santini Khadeni. That's Cathica with a C, in case you want to write to Floor five hundred praising me, and please do. Now, please feel free to ask any questions. The process of news gathering must be open, honest, and beyond bias. That's company policy.
SUKI: Actually, it's the law.
CATHICA: Yes, thank you, Suki. Okay, keep it calm. Don't show off for the guests. Here we go.
CATHICA: And engage safety
CATHICA: And three, two, and spike.
DOCTOR: Compressed information, streaming into her. Reports from every city, every country, every planet, and they all get packaged inside her head. She becomes part of the software. Her brain is the computer.
ROSE: If it all goes through her, she must be a genius.
DOCTOR: Nah, she wouldn't remember any of it. There's too much. Her head'd blow up. The brain's the processor. As soon as it closes, she forgets.
ROSE: So, what about all these people round the edge?
DOCTOR: They've all got tiny little chips in their head, connecting them to her and they transmit six hundred channels. Every single fact in the Empire beams out of this place. Now that's what I call power.
COMPUTER: Analysis confirmed. Security breach.
EDITOR: I knew it. Which one? It's someone inside that room. Which one?
COMPUTER: Isolating breach.
EDITOR: Come on, show me. Who is it?
ROSE : You all right?
ADAM : I can see her brain.
ROSE: Do you want to get out?
ADAM: No. No, this technology, it's amazing.
DOCTOR: This technology's wrong.
ROSE: Trouble?
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah.
EDITOR: That's it! Oh yes, she's the liar. Intercept and scan.
EDITOR: Gotcha.
CATHICA: Come off it, Suki. I wasn't even halfway. What was that for?
SUKI: Sorry. It must've been a glitch.
CATHICA: Oh.
EDITOR: Her information's been tampered with. There's a second biography hidden underneath.
EDITOR: Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir. Yes, well, her data was encrypted, so there's no way we could have found her sooner.
EDITOR: I'm sorry, I. Yes, sorry, sir. Absolutely. Get her up here. Now.
TANNOY: Promotion.
CATHICA: Come on. This is it. Come on. Oh God, make it me. Come on, say my name, say my name, say my name.
TANNOY: Promotion for Suki Macrae Cantrell. Please proceed to Floor five hundred.
SUKI: I don't believe it. Floor five hundred.
CATHICA: How the hell did you manage that? I'm above you.
SUKI: I don't know. I just applied on the off chance and they've said yes.
CATHICA: That's so not fair. I've been applying to Floor five hundred for three years.
ROSE: What's Floor five hundred?
DOCTOR: The walls are made of gold.
SUKI: Cathica, I'm going to miss you. Floor five hundred, thank you.
DOCTOR: I didn't do anything.
SUKI: Well, you're my lucky charm.
DOCTOR: All right. I'll hug anyone.
ROSE: Come on, it's not that bad.
ADAM: What, with the head thing?
ROSE: Yeah, well, she's closed it now!
ADAM: Yeah, but. It's everything. It freaks me out. And I just need to. If I could just cool down. Sort of acclimatise.
ROSE: How do you mean?
ADAM: Maybe I could just go and sit on the observation deck. Would that be all right? Soak it in, you know. Pretend I'm a citizen of the year two hundred thousand.
ROSE: Do you want me to come with you?
ADAM: No, no, you stick with the Doctor. You'd rather be with him. It's going to take a better man than me to get between you two. Anyway, I'll be on the deck.
ROSE: Here you go. Take the Tardis key. You know, just in case it gets a bit too much.
ADAM: Yeah, like it's not weird in there.
TANNOY: All staff are reminded that the sixteen forty break session has been shortened by ten minutes. Thank you.
SUKI: Oh, my God, I've got to go. I can't keep them waiting. I'm sorry. Say goodbye to Steve for me. Bye!
CATHICA: Good riddance.
DOCTOR: You're talking like you'll never see her again. She's only going upstairs.
CATHICA: We won't. Once you go to Floor five hundred you never come back.
DOCTOR: Have you ever been up there?
CATHICA: I can't. You need a key for the lift, and you only get a key with promotion. No one gets to five hundred except for the chosen few.
SUKI: Who're you?
EDITOR: I'm the Editor.
SUKI: What's happening? There are bodies out there. What's going on?
EDITOR: While we're asking questions, would you please confirm your name.
SUKI : My name is Suki Macrae Cantrell. I was born one nine nine apostrophe eight nine in the Independent Republic of Morocco.
EDITOR: Liar.
SUKI : Hobbies include reading and archeology. I'm not an expert or anything, I just like digging.
EDITOR: Liar.
SUKI : I want to work for Satellite Five because my sister can't afford university, and the pay scheme is really good
EDITOR: Liar! Let's look at the facts, shall we?
EDITOR: Ah, hidden behind a genetic graft, but that's still you. Eva Saint Julienne, last surviving member of the Freedom Fifteen. Hmm, self declared anarchist, is that right?
SUKI: Who controls Satellite Five?
EDITOR: There's the truth!
SUKI: The Freedom Foundation has been monitoring Satellite Five's transmissions. We have absolute proof that the facts are being manipulated. You are lying to the people.
EDITOR: Ooo, I love it. Say it again.
SUKI: This whole system is corrupt. Who do you represent?
EDITOR: I'm merely a humble slave. I answer to the Editor in Chief.
SUKI: Who is he? Where is he?
EDITOR: He's overseeing everything. Literally everything. If you don't mind, I'm going to have to refer this upwards.
SUKI: What is that?
EDITOR: Your boss. This has always been your boss, since the day you were born.
ADAM: Give me access.
ADAM: Give me
ADAM: I can learn anything.
ADAM: Oh my God.
CATHICA: Look, they only give us twenty minutes maintenance. Can't you give it a rest?
DOCTOR: But you've never been to another floor? Not even one floor down?
CATHICA: I went to floor sixteen when I first arrived. That's medical. That's when I got my head done, and then I came straight here. Satellite Five, you work, eat and sleep on the same floor. That's it, that's all. You're not management, are you.
DOCTOR: At last. She's clever.
CATHICA: Yeah, well, whatever it is, don't involve me. I don't know anything.
DOCTOR: Don't you even ask?
CATHICA: Well, why would I?
DOCTOR: You're a journalist. Why's all the crew human?
CATHICA: What's that got to do with anything?
DOCTOR: There's no aliens on board. Why?
CATHICA: I don't know. No real reason. They're not banned or anything.
DOCTOR: Then where are they?
CATHICA: I suppose immigration's tightened up. It's had to, what with all the threats.
DOCTOR: What threats?
CATHICA: I don't know all of them. Usual stuff. And the price of space warp doubled so that kept the visitors away. Oh, and the government on Chavic Five's collapsed, so that lot stopped coming, you see. Just lots of little reasons, that's all.
DOCTOR: Adding up to one great big fact, and you didn't even notice.
CATHICA: Doctor, I think if there was any kind of conspiracy, Satellite Five would have seen it. We see everything.
DOCTOR: I can see better. This society's the wrong shape, even the technology.
CATHICA: It's cutting edge.
DOCTOR: It's backwards. There's a great big door in your head. You should've chucked this out years ago.
ROSE: So, what do you think's going on?
DOCTOR: It's not just this space station, it's the whole attitude. It's the way people think. The great and bountiful Human Empire's stunted. Something's holding it back.
CATHICA: And how would you know?
DOCTOR: Trust me, humanity's been set back about ninety years. When did Satellite Five start broadcasting?
CATHICA: Ninety one years ago.
ADAM: Mum, Dad, keep this message, okay?
ADAM : Whatever you do, don't erase it. Save it. You got that?
ADAM: The microprocessor became
ADAM : Redundant in the year two thousand nineteen, replaced
ADAM: By a system called SMT. That's Single Molecule Transcription
ADAM: No, no, no, no, no! What're you doing? Come back! Why are you doing that? What's Floor sixteen? What's down there?
ADAM: Sorry, er, floor sixteen, that's, er. What do you cover?
NURSE: Medical non-emergency.
ADAM: Right. Yeah, wrong floor. I'm having technical difficulties. My screen keeps freezing, blocking me out.
NURSE: No, that's medical. There must be something wrong with your chip.
ADAM: Yes. Yeah, of course, yeah. I haven't got one.
NURSE: No wonder you can't get a screen to work. What are you, a student?
ADAM: Yes. Yeah, I'm er, I'm on a research project from the University of Mars.
NURSE: The Martian boondocks. Typical.
ADAM: Yeah.
NURSE: Well, you still need chipping.
ADAM: So, does that mean like brain surgery?
NURSE: That's an old fashioned phrase, but it's the same thing, yes.
ADAM: Oh. Okay, never mind. But if I get a chip that means I could use any computer.
NURSE: Absolutely. You'll have to pay for it. They've stopped subsidising.
ADAM: Oh! Right. Sorry. Wasting your time. Thanks.
ADAM: Hold on. Can I use this?
NURSE: That'll do nicely.
 
NURSE: It all comes down to two basic types. Type one, the head chip inserted into the back of the skull, one hundred credits. There's the chip. Tiny. Invisible. No scarring. Type two is the full info-spike.
ADAM: Oh, that's the
ADAM: Thing.
NURSE: That's the one. It does cost ten thousand.
ADAM: Oh, well, I, er, I couldn't afford it then.
NURSE: Not at all. It turns out you've got unlimited credit.
ADAM: No, but I couldn't have it done, I mean, that's got to hurt, hasn't it?
NURSE: Painless. Contractual guarantee.
ADAM: No, my mate's waiting upstairs, I can't have major surgery.
NURSE: It takes ten minutes. That sort of money buys a very fast picosurgeon.
ADAM: No, but I, I couldn't. No, no, it's
NURSE: Type one, you can interface with a simple computer. Type two, you are the computer. You can transmit any piece of information from the archive of Satellite Five, which is just about the entire history of the human race. Now, which one's it going to be?
CATHICA: We are so going to get in trouble. You're not allowed to touch the mainframe. You're going to get told off.
DOCTOR: Rose, tell her to button it.
CATHICA: You can't just vandalise the place. Someone's going to notice!
EDITOR: I don't understand. We did a full security scan. That man was there when we found Suki Macrae Cantrell. There were no indications about him. And yet here he is, clearly acting outside the parameters. Fascinating.
EDITOR: Yes, sir. Absolutely. At once. Check him. Double check him. Triple check him. Quadruple. 
CATHICA: This is nothing to do with me. I'm going back to work.
DOCTOR: Go on, then. See you!
CATHICA: I can't just leave you, can I!
ROSE: If you want to be useful, get them to turn the heating down. It's boiling. What's wrong with this place? Can't they do something about it?
CATHICA: I don't know. We keep asking. Something to do with the turbine.
DOCTOR: Something to do with the turbine.
CATHICA: Well, I don't know!
DOCTOR: Exactly. I give up on you, Cathica. Now, Rose. Look at Rose. Rose is asking the right kind of question.
ROSE: Oh, thank you.
DOCTOR: Why is it so hot?
CATHICA: One minutes you're worried about the Empire and the next it's the central heating!
DOCTOR: Well, never underestimate plumbing. Plumbing's very important.
COMPUTER: Security scan complete.
EDITOR: Well, who is he?
COMPUTER: He is no one.
EDITOR: What does that mean?
COMPUTER: He is no one.
EDITOR: What, you mean he has a fake ID?
COMPUTER: He has no identification.
EDITOR: But everyone's registered. We have a census for the entire Empire.
COMPUTER: He is no one.
EDITOR: What, he doesn't exist? Not anywhere?
COMPUTER: He is no one.
EDITOR: What about the blonde?
COMPUTER: She is no one.
EDITOR: Both of them? Well, we all know what happens to non-entities. They get promoted. Bring them up.
DOCTOR: Here we go. Satellite Five, pipes and plumbing. Look at the layout.
CATHICA: This is ridiculous. You've got access to the computer's core. You can look at the archive, the news, the stock exchange and you're looking at pipes?
DOCTOR: But there's something wrong.
CATHICA: I suppose.
ROSE: Why, what is it?
CATHICA: The ventilation system. Cooling ducts, ice filters, all working flat out channelling massive amounts of heat down.
DOCTOR: All the way from the top.
ROSE: Floor five hundred.
DOCTOR: Something up there is generating tons and tons of heat.
ROSE: Well, I don't know about you, but I feel like I'm missing out on a party. It's all going on upstairs. Fancy a trip?
CATHICA: You can't. You need a key.
DOCTOR: Keys are just codes, and I've got the codes right here. Here we go. Override two one five point nine.
CATHICA: How come it's given you the code?
DOCTOR : Someone up there likes me.
NURSE: I told you it was painless. No scarring, you see? Perfect success.
ADAM: How do I activate it?
NURSE: It's a personal choice. Some people whistle. I know one man who triggers it with O, Danny Boy. But you're set on default for now. That's a click of the fingers.
ADAM: So you mean, I just
NURSE: Click.
ROSE: Come on. Come with us.
CATHICA: No way.
DOCTOR: Bye!
CATHICA: Well, don't mention my name. When you get in trouble, just don't involve me.
DOCTOR: That's her gone. Adam's given up. Looks like it's just you and me.
ROSE: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.
ROSE: Yep.
ADAM: Oh, my God. I'm going to be sick.
NURSE: Special offer. We installed the vomitomatic at the same time. Nano-termites have been placed in the lining of your throat. In the event of sickness, they freeze the waste.
DOCTOR: The walls are not made of gold. You should go back downstairs.
ROSE: Tough.
EDITOR: I started without you. This is fascinating. Satellite Five contains every piece of information within the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. Birth certificates, shopping habits, bank statements, but you two, you don't exist. Not a trace. No birth, no job, not the slightest kiss. How can you walk through the world and not leave a single footprint?
ROSE: Suki. Suki! Hello? Can you hear me? Suki? What have you done to her?
DOCTOR: I think she's dead.
ROSE: She's working.
DOCTOR: They've all got chips in their head, and the chips keep going, like puppets.
EDITOR: Oh! You're full of information. But it's only fair we get some information back, because apparently, you're no one. It's so rare not to know something. Who are you?
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter, because we're off. Nice to meet you. Come on.
EDITOR: Tell me who you are.
DOCTOR: Since that information's keeping us alive, I'm hardly going to say, am I.
EDITOR: Well, perhaps my Editor in Chief can convince you otherwise.
DOCTOR: And who's that?
EDITOR: It may interest you to know that this is not the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire. In fact, it's not actually human at all. It's merely a place where humans happen to live.
EDITOR: Yeah. Yeah, sorry. It's a place where humans are allowed to live by kind permission of my client.
ROSE: What is that?
DOCTOR: You mean that thing's in charge of Satellite Five?
EDITOR: That thing, as you put it, is in charge of the human race. For almost a hundred years, mankind has been shaped and guided, his knowledge and ambition strictly controlled by it's broadcast news, edited by my superior, your master, and humanity's guiding light, the mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe. I call him Max.
EDITOR: Create a climate of fear and it's easy to keep the borders closed. It's just a matter of emphasis. The right word in the right broadcast repeated often enough can destabilise an economy, invent an enemy, change a vote.
ROSE: So all the people on Earth are like, slaves.
EDITOR: Well, now, there's an interesting point. Is a slave a slave if he doesn't know he's enslaved?
DOCTOR: Yes.
EDITOR: Oh. I was hoping for a philosophical debate. Is that all I'm going to get? Yes?
DOCTOR: Yes.
EDITOR: You're no fun.
DOCTOR: Let me out of these manacles. You'll find out how much fun I am.
EDITOR: Oh, he's tough, isn't he. But, come on. Isn't it a great system? You've got to admire it, just a little bit.
ROSE: You can't hide something on this scale. Somebody must have noticed.
EDITOR: From time to time, someone, yes, but the computer chip system allows me to see inside their brains. I can see the smallest doubt and crush it.
EDITOR: Then they just carry on, living the life, strutting about downstairs and all over the surface of the Earth like they're so individual, when of course, they're not. They're just cattle. In that respect, the Jagrafess hasn't changed a thing.
ROSE: What about you? You're not a Jagrabelly
DOCTOR: Jagrafess.
ROSE: Jagrafess. You're not a Jagrafess. You're human.
EDITOR: Yeah, well, simply being human doesn't pay very well.
ROSE: But you couldn't have done this all on your own.
EDITOR: No. I represent a consortium of banks. Money prefers a long-term investment. Also, the Jagrafess needed a little hand to install himself.
DOCTOR: No wonder, a creature that size. What's his life span?
EDITOR: Three thousand years.
DOCTOR: That's one hell of a metabolism generating all that heat. That's why Satellite Five's so hot. You pump it out of the creature, channel it downstairs. Jagrafess stays cool, it stays alive. Satellite Five is one great big life support system.
ADAM : It's me again. Don't wipe this message. It's just going to sound like white noise, but save it because I can
ADAM: Translate it, okay? Three, two, one and spike.
EDITOR: But that's why you're so dangerous. Knowledge is power, but you remain unknown. Who are you?
DOCTOR: Leave her alone. I'm the Doctor, she's Rose Tyler. We're nothing, we're just wandering.
EDITOR: Tell me who you are!
DOCTOR: I just said!
EDITOR: Yes, but who do you work for? Who sent you? Who knows about us? Who exactly
EDITOR: Time Lord.
DOCTOR: What?
EDITOR: Oh, yes. The last of the Time Lords in his travelling machine. Oh, with his little human girl from long ago
DOCTOR: You don't know what you're talking about.
EDITOR: Time travel.
ADAM: Help!
DOCTOR: Someone's been telling you lies.
EDITOR: Young master Adam Mitchell?
ROSE: Oh, my God. His head!
DOCTOR: What the hell's he done? What the hell's he gone and done? They're reading his mind. He's telling them everything.
EDITOR: And through him, I know everything about you. Every piece of information in his head is now mine. And you have infinite knowledge, Doctor. The Human Empire is tiny compared to what you've seen in your T A R D I S. Tardis.
DOCTOR: Well, you'll never get your hands on it. I'll die first.
EDITOR: Die all you like. I don't need you. I've got the key.
DOCTOR: You and your boyfriends!
EDITOR: Today, we are the headlines. We can rewrite history. We could prevent mankind from ever developing.
DOCTOR: And no one's going to stop you because you've bred a human race that doesn't bother to ask questions. Stupid little slaves, believing every lie. They'll just trot right into the slaughter house if they're told it's made of gold.
CATHICA: Disengage safety.
EDITOR: What's happening?
CATHICA: Maximum access. Override Floor one three nine.
CATHICA: And spike!
EDITOR: Someone's disengaged the safety. Who's that?
ROSE: It's Cathica.
DOCTOR: And she's thinking. She's using what she knows.
EDITOR: Terminate her access.
DOCTOR: Everything I told her about Satellite Five. The pipes, the filters, she's reversing it. Look at that.
DOCTOR: It's getting hot.
EDITOR:  I said, terminate. Burn out her mind.
CATHICA: Oh no, you don't. You should have promoted me years back.
DOCTOR: She's venting the heat up here. The Jagrafess needs to stay cool and now it's sitting on top of a volcano.
EDITOR: Yes, I'm trying, sir, but I don't know how she did it. It's impossible. A member of staff with an idea.
ROSE: What do I do?
DOCTOR: Flick the switch! Oi, mate, want to bank on a certainty? Massive heat in a massive body, massive bang. See you in the headlines!
EDITOR: Actually, sir, if it's all the same to you, I think I'll resign. Bye, then!
EDITOR: Let go of me!
EDITOR: Let go of me! Let go of me!
DOCTOR: We're just going to go. I hate tidying up. Too many questions. You'll manage.
CATHICA: You'll have to stay and explain it. No one's going to believe me.
DOCTOR: Oh, they might start believing a lot of things now. The human race should accelerate. All back to normal.
CATHICA: What about your friend?
DOCTOR: He's not my friend.
ROSE: Now, don't
ADAM: I'm all right now. Much better. And I've got the key. Look, it's. It all worked out for the best, didn't it? You know, it's not actually my fault, because you were in charge.
ADAM: It's my house. I'm home! Oh, my God, I'm home! Blimey. I thought you were going to chuck me out of an airlock.
DOCTOR: Is there something else you want to tell me?
ADAM: No. What do you mean?
DOCTOR: The archive of Satellite Five. One second of that message could've changed the world.
DOCTOR: That's it, then. See you.
ADAM: How do you mean, see you?
DOCTOR: As in goodbye.
ADAM: But what about me? You can't just go. I've got my head. I've got a chip type two. My head opens.
DOCTOR: What, like this?
ADAM: Don't.
DOCTOR: Don't do what?
ADAM: Stop it!
ROSE: All right now, Doctor, that's enough. Stop it.
ADAM: Thank you.
ADAM: Oi!
ROSE: Sorry, I couldn't resist.
DOCTOR: The whole of history could have changed because of you.
ADAM: I just wanted to help.
DOCTOR: You were helping yourself.
ADAM: And I'm sorry. I've said I'm sorry, and I am, I really am, but you can't just leave me like this.
DOCTOR: Yes I can. 'Cause if you show that head to anyone, they'll dissect you in seconds. You'll have to live a very quiet life. Keep out of trouble. Be average, unseen. Good luck.
ADAM: But I want to come with you.
DOCTOR: I only take the best. I've got Rose.
ADAM: Rose, Rose. Oh, my God.
MUM : Who's that? Geoff, is that you?
ADAM: It's me, mum. Don't come in. Wait there a minute.
MUM : Oh, my Lord. You never told me you were coming home! Hold on, I'll just take my coat off. You should've told me you were coming home. I would've got your favourite tea in.
ADAM: Rose, take me with you.
MUM : Hey, what's that noise? Have you left the back door open? Blimey, there's a draft.
MUM: What a surprise. Oh, let me look at you. Oh, six months. It's like I saw you yesterday. Isn't it funny? The time goes by like that.
