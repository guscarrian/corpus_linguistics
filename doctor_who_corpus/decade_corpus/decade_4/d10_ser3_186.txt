Blink
SALLY: Kathy?
DOCTOR : Yet. They're coming. They're coming for you, but listen, your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast, faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink. Good luck.
KATHY: Hello?
SALLY: Bit freaked. Need to talk. Making you a coffee.
KATHY : Sally Sparrow, it's one in the morning. Do you think I'm coming round at one in the morning?
SALLY: No.
SALLY : I'm in the kitchen. What's that on all those screens in your front room?
KATHY: Oh, God. Oh, God. Sally, you've met my brother Larry, haven't you?
SALLY: No.
KATHY : You're about to.
LARRY: Okay. Not sure, but really, really hoping. Pants?
SALLY: No.
KATHY : Put them on! Put them on! I hate you! What're you thinking?
KATHY: Sorry. My useless brother. Sally? What's wrong? What's happened?
KATHY: Okay, let's investigate! You and me, girl investigators. Love it. Hey! Sparrow and Nightingale. That so works.
SALLY: Bit ITV.
KATHY: I know!
KATHY: What did you come here for anyway?
SALLY: I love old things. They make me feel sad.
KATHY: What's good about sad?
SALLY: It's happy for deep people.
SALLY: The Weeping Angel.
KATHY: Not bad in my garden.
SALLY: It's moved.
KATHY: It's what?
SALLY: Since yesterday. I'm sure of it. It's closer. It's got closer to the house.
SALLY: How can my name be written here? How is that possible?
KATHY: Who'd come here? What are you doing? It could be a burglar.
SALLY: A burglar who rings the doorbell?
KATHY: Okay. I'll stay here in case of
SALLY: In case of?
KATHY: Incidents?
SALLY: Okay.
MALCOLM: I'm looking for Sally Sparrow.
SALLY: How did you know I'd be here?
MALCOLM: I was told to bring this letter on this date at this exact time to Sally Sparrow.
SALLY: Looks old.
MALCOLM: It is old. I'm sorry, do you have anything with a photograph on it, like a driving licence?
SALLY : How did he know I was coming here? I didn't tell anyone. How could anyone have known? 
MALCOLM : It's all a bit complicated. I'm not sure I understand it myself.
MALCOLM: I'm sorry, I feel really stupid, but I was told to make absolutely sure. It's so hard to tell with these little photographs, isn't it?
SALLY: Apparently.
MALCOLM: Well, here goes, I suppose. Funny feeling, after all these years.
SALLY: Who's it from?
MALCOLM: Well, that's a long story, actually.
SALLY: Give me a name.
MALCOLM : Katherine Wainwright.
MALCOLM : But she specified I should tell you that prior to marriage
MALCOLM: She was called Kathy Nightingale.
SALLY: Kathy?
MALCOLM: Kathy, yes. Katherine Costello Nightingale.
SALLY: Is this a joke?
MALCOLM: A joke?
SALLY: Kathy, is this you? Very funny.
SALLY: Kathy?
SALLY: Kathy? Kathy!
MALCOLM: Please, you need to take this. I promised.
KATHY: Excuse me? Where am I? I was in London. I was in the middle of London.
BEN: You're in Hull.
KATHY: No, I'm not.
BEN: This is Hull.
KATHY: No, it isn't.
BEN: You're in Hull.
KATHY: I'm not in Hull. Stop saying Hull.
SALLY: Who are you? Why are you here?
MALCOLM: I made a promise.
SALLY: Who to?
MALCOLM: My grandmother. Katherine Costello Nightingale.
BEN: Don't have that in London. There's no call for it. It's all Hull.
KATHY: 1920?
SALLY: Your grandmother?
MALCOLM: Yes. She died twenty years ago.
SALLY: So they're related?
MALCOLM: I'm sorry?
SALLY: My Kathy, your grandmother. They're practically identical.
BEN: Where are you going?
KATHY : My dearest Sally Sparrow. If my grandson has done as he promises he will, then as you read these words it has been mere minutes since we last spoke. For you. For me, it has been over sixty years. The third of the photographs is of my children. The youngest is Sally. I named her after you, of course.
SALLY: This is sick. This is totally sick.
SALLY: Kathy? Kathy! Kathy?
SALLY: No, wait! Hang on!
KATHY : I suppose, unless I live to a really exceptional old age, I will be long gone as you read this. Don't feel sorry for me. I have led a good and full life. I've loved a good man and been well loved in return. You would have liked Ben. He was the very first person I met in 1920.
KATHY: Are you following me?
BEN: Yeah.
KATHY: Are you going to stop following me?
BEN: No, I don't think so.
KATHY: To take one breath in 2007 and the next in 1920 is a strange way to start a new life, but a new life is exactly what I've always wanted.
SALLY: 1902? You told him you were eighteen? You lying cow.
KATHY: My mum and dad are gone by your time, so really there's only Lawrence to tell. He works at the DVD store on Queen Street. I don't know what you're going to say to him, but I know you'll think of something. Just tell him I love him.
SALLY: Excuse me, I'm looking for Lawrence Nightingale.
BANTO: Through the back.
SALLY: Hello?
DOCTOR : Martha.
MARTHA : Sorry.
DOCTOR: Quite possibly.  Afraid so.
LARRY: Oh. Hello. Can I help you?
SALLY: Hi.
DOCTOR : Thirty eight.
LARRY: Er, just a mo.
LARRY: Hang on. We've met, haven't we.
SALLY: It'll come to you.
LARRY: Oh, my God.
SALLY: There it is.
LARRY: Sorry. Sorry again about the whole
SALLY: Message from your sister.
LARRY: Oh! Okay. What? What is it? What's the message?
SALLY: She's had to go away for a bit.
LARRY: Where?
SALLY: Just a work thing. Nothing to worry about.
LARRY: Okay.
SALLY: And
LARRY: And what?
SALLY: She loves you.
LARRY: She what?
SALLY: She said to say. She just sort of mentioned it. She loves you. There, that's nice, isn't it?
LARRY: Is she ill?
SALLY: No! No.
LARRY: Am I ill?
SALLY: No!
LARRY: Is this a trick?
SALLY: No. She loves you.
DOCTOR : Yeah. Yeah, people don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
SALLY: Who is this guy?
LARRY: Sorry, the pause thing keeps slipping. Stupid thing.
SALLY: Last night at Kathy's, you had him on all those screens. That same guy. Talking about, I don't know, blinking or something.
LARRY: Yeah, the bit about the blinking's great. I was just checking to see if they were all the same.
SALLY: What were the same? What is this? Who is he?
LARRY: An Easter egg.
SALLY: Excuse me?
LARRY: Like a DVD extra, yeah? You know how on DVDs they put extras on, documentaries and stuff? Well, sometimes they put on hidden ones, and they call them Easter eggs. You have to go looking for them. Follow a bunch of clues on the menu screen.
DOCTOR : Complicated.
LARRY: Sorry. It's interesting, actually. He is on seventeen different DVDs. There are seventeen totally unrelated DVDs, all with him on. Always hidden away, always a secret. Not even the publishers know how he got there. I've talked to the manufacturers, right? They don't even know. He's like he's a ghost DVD extra. Just shows up where he's not supposed to be. But only on those. Those seventeen.
SALLY: Well, what does he do?
LARRY: Just sits there, making random remarks. It's like we're hearing half a conversation. Me and the guys are always trying to work out the other half.
SALLY: When you say you and the guys, you mean the internet, don't you?
LARRY: How'd you know?
SALLY: Spooky, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Very complicated.
BANTO : Laurence? Need you.
LARRY: Excuse me a sec.
DOCTOR : People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.
SALLY: Started well, that sentence.
DOCTOR: It got away from me, yeah.
SALLY: Okay, that was weird. Like you can hear me.
DOCTOR: Well, I can hear you.
SALLY: Okay, that's enough. I've had enough now. I've had a long day and I've had bloody enough! Sorry. Bad day.
LARRY: Got you the list.
SALLY: What?
LARRY: The seventeen DVDs. I thought you might be interested.
SALLY: Yeah, great. Thanks.
BANTO: Go to the police, you stupid woman. Why does nobody ever just go to the police?
SALLY: Look, I know how mad I'm sounding.
DESK SERGEANT: Shall we try it from the beginning this time?
SALLY: Okay. There's this house. A big old house, been empty for years, falling apart. Wester Drumlins, out by the estate. You've probably seen it.
DESK SERGEANT: Wester Drumlin?
SALLY: Yes.
DESK SERGEANT: Could you just wait here for a minute?
SALLY: Okay, cracking up now.
BILLY: Hi. DI Billy Shipton. Wester Drumlins, that's mine. Can't talk to you now, got a thing I can't be late for, so if you could just. Hello.
SALLY: Hello.
BILLY: Eh, Marcie, can you tell them I'm going to be late for that thing?
SALLY: All of them?
BILLY: Over the last two years, yeah. They all still have personal items in them and a couple still had the motor running.
SALLY: So over the last two years, the owners of all of these vehicles have driven up to Wester Drumlins House, parked outside and just disappeared.
SALLY: What's that?
BILLY: Ah! The pride of the Wester Drumlins collection. We found that there, too. Somebody's idea of a joke, I suppose.
SALLY: But what is it? What's a police box?
BILLY: Well, it's a special kind of phone box for policemen. They used to have them all over. But this isn't a real one. The phone's just a dummy, and the windows are the wrong size. We can't even get in it. Ordinary Yale lock, but nothing fits. But that's not the big question. See, you're missing the big question.
SALLY: Okay, what's the big question?
BILLY: Will you have a drink with me?
SALLY: I'm sorry?
BILLY: Drink? You? Me? Now?
SALLY: Aren't you on duty, Detective Inspector Shipton?
BILLY: Nope. Knocked off before I left. Told them I had a family crisis.
SALLY: Why?
BILLY: Because life is short and you are hot. Drink?
SALLY: No.
BILLY: Ever?
SALLY: Maybe.
BILLY: Phone number?
SALLY: Moving kind of fast, DI Shipton.
BILLY: Billy. I'm off duty.
SALLY: Aren't you just.
BILLY: Is that your phone number?
SALLY: Just my phone number. Not a promise. Not a guarantee. Not an IOU. Just a phone number.
BILLY: And that's Sally?
SALLY: Sally Shipton. Sparrow! Sally Sparrow. I'm going now. Don't look at me.
BILLY: I'll phone you.
SALLY: Don't look at me.
BILLY: Phone you tomorrow.
SALLY: Don't look at me.
BILLY: Might even phone you tonight.
SALLY: Don't look at me!
BILLY: Definitely going to phone you, gorgeous girl!
SALLY: You definitely better!
BILLY : Ordinary Yale lock, but nothing fits.
DOCTOR: Welcome.
BILLY: Where am I?
DOCTOR: 1969. Not bad, as it goes. You've got the moon landing to look forward to.
MARTHA: Oh, the moon landing's brilliant. We went four times, back when we had transport.
DOCTOR: Working on it.
BILLY: How did I get here?
DOCTOR: The same way we did. The touch of an angel. Same one, probably, since you ended up in the same year. No, no. No, no, no, don't get up. Time travel without a capsule. Nasty. Catch your breath. Don't go swimming for half an hour.
BILLY: I don't. I can't.
DOCTOR: Fascinating race, the Weeping Angels. The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death. The rest of your life used up and blown away in the blink of an eye. You die in the past, and in the present they consume the energy of all the days you might have had. All your stolen moments. They're creatures of the abstract. They live off potential energy.
BILLY: What in God's name are you talking about?
MARTHA: Trust me. Just nod when he stops for breath.
DOCTOR: Tracked you down with this. This is my timey-wimey detector. It goes ding when there's stuff. Also, it can boil an egg at thirty paces, whether you want it to or not, actually, so I've learned to stay away from hens. It's not pretty when they blow.
BILLY: I don't understand. Where am I?
MARTHA: 1969, like he says.
DOCTOR: Normally, I'd offer you a lift home, but somebody nicked my motor. So I need you to take a message to Sally Sparrow. And I'm sorry, Billy. I am very, very sorry. It's going to take you a while.
SALLY: Hello? Billy, where are you? Where?
SALLY: Billy?
BILLY: It was raining when we met.
SALLY: It's the same rain.
SALLY: She looks nice.
BILLY: Her name was Sally, too.
SALLY: Sally Shipton.
BILLY: Sally Shipton. I often thought about looking for you before tonight, but apparently it would've torn a hole in the fabric of space and time, and destroyed two thirds of the universe. Also, I'd lost my hair.
SALLY: Two thirds of the universe. Where'd you get that from?
BILLY: There's a man in 1969. He sent me with a message for you.
SALLY: What man?
BILLY: The Doctor.
SALLY: And what was the message?
BILLY: Just this. Look at the list.
SALLY: What does that mean? Is that it? Look at the list?
BILLY: He said you'd have it by now. A list of seventeen DVDs. I didn't stay a policeman back then. Got into publishing. Then video publishing. Then DVDs, of course.
SALLY: You put the Easter Egg on.
BILLY: Have you noticed what all seventeen DVDs have in common yet? I suppose it's hard for you, in a way.
SALLY: How could the Doctor have even known I had a list? I only just got this.
BILLY: I asked him how, but he said he couldn't tell me. He said you'd understand it one day, but that I never would.
SALLY: Soon as I understand it, I'll come and tell you.
BILLY: No, gorgeous girl, you can't. There's only tonight. He told me all those years ago that we'll only meet again this one time. On the night I die.
SALLY: Oh, Billy.
BILLY: It's kept me going. I'm an old, sick man. But I've had something to look forward to. Ah, life is long, and you are hot. Oh, look at my hands. They're old man's hands. How did that happen?
SALLY: I'll stay. I'm going to stay with you, okay?
BILLY: Thank you, Sally Sparrow. I have till the rain stops.
LARRY: Banto's.
SALLY : They're mine.
LARRY: What?
SALLY: The DVDs on the list. The seventeen DVDs. What they've got in common is me. They're all the DVDs I own. The Easter Egg was intended for me.
LARRY: You've only got seventeen DVDs?
SALLY: Do you have a portable DVD player?
LARRY : Of course. Why?
SALLY: I want you to meet me.
LARRY: Where?
SALLY : Wester Drumlins.
LARRY: You live in Scooby Doo's house.
SALLY: For God's sake, I don't live here.
LARRY: Okay, this is the one with the clearest sound. Slightly better picture quality on this one, but I don't know
SALLY: It doesn't matter.
LARRY: Okay. There he is.
SALLY: The Doctor.
LARRY: Who's the Doctor?
SALLY: He's the Doctor.
DOCTOR : Yup. That's me.
SALLY: Okay, that was scary.
LARRY: No, it sounds like he's replying, but he always says that.
DOCTOR : Yes, I do.
LARRY: And that.
DOCTOR : Yup. And this.
SALLY: He can hear us. Oh, my God, you can really hear us?
LARRY: Of course he can't hear us. Look, I've got a transcript. See? Everything he says. Yup, that's me. Yes, I do. Yup, and this. Next it's
DOCTOR  + LARRY: Are you going to read out the whole thing?
LARRY: Sorry.
SALLY: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm a time traveller. Or I was. I'm stuck in 1969.
MARTHA : We're stuck. All of space and time, he promised me. Now I've got a job in a shop. I've got to support him!
DOCTOR : Martha.
MARTHA : Sorry.
SALLY: I've seen this bit before.
DOCTOR : Quite possibly.
SALLY: 1969, that's where you're talking from?
DOCTOR : Afraid so.
SALLY: But you're replying to me. You can't know exactly what I'm going to say, forty years before I say it.
DOCTOR : Thirty eight.
LARRY: I'm getting this down. I'm writing in your bits.
SALLY: How? How is this possible? Tell me.
LARRY: Not so fast.
DOCTOR : People don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
SALLY: Then what is it?
DOCTOR : Complicated.
SALLY: Tell me.
DOCTOR : Very complicated.
SALLY: I'm clever and I'm listening. And don't patronise me because people have died, and I'm not happy. Tell me.
DOCTOR : People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.
SALLY: Yeah, I've seen this bit before. You said that sentence got away from you.
DOCTOR : It got away from me, yeah.
SALLY: Next thing you're going to say is, well I can hear you.
DOCTOR : Well, I can hear you.
SALLY: This isn't possible.
LARRY: No. It's brilliant!
DOCTOR : Well, not hear you, exactly, but I know everything you're going to say.
LARRY: Always gives me the shivers, that bit.
SALLY: How can you know what I'm going to say?
DOCTOR : Look to your left.
LARRY: What does he mean by look to your left? I've written tons about that on the forums. I think it's a political statement.
SALLY: He means you. What are you doing?
LARRY: I'm writing in your bits. That way I've got a complete transcript of the whole conversation. Wait until this hits the net. This will explode the egg forums.
DOCTOR : I've got a copy of the finished transcript. It's on my autocue.
SALLY: How can you have a copy of the finished transcript? It's still being written.
DOCTOR : I told you. I'm a time traveller. I got it in the future.
SALLY: Okay, let me get my head round this. You're reading aloud from a transcript of a conversation you're still having.
DOCTOR : Yeah. Wibbly wobbly, timey-wimey.
SALLY: Never mind that. You can do shorthand?
LARRY: So?
DOCTOR : What matters is, we can communicate. We have got big problems now. They have taken the blue box, haven't they? The angels have the phone box.
LARRY: The angels have the phone box. That's my favourite, I've got it on a t-shirt.
SALLY: What do you mean, angels? You mean those statue things?
DOCTOR : Creatures from another world.
SALLY: But they're just statues.
DOCTOR : Only when you see them.
SALLY: What does that mean?
DOCTOR : The lonely assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the universe, or very nearly, and they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defence system ever evolved. They are quantum-locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they are seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice. It's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. Of course, a stone can't kill you either. But then you turn your head away, then you blink, and oh yes it can.
SALLY: Don't take your eyes off that.
DOCTOR : That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping. They can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. The loneliest creatures in the universe. And I'm sorry. I am very, very sorry. It's up to you now.
SALLY: What am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR : The blue box, it's my time machine. There is a world of time energy in there they could feast on forever, but the damage they could do could switch off the sun. You have got to send it back to me.
SALLY: How? How?
DOCTOR : And that's it, I'm afraid. There's no more from you on the transcript, that's the last I've got. I don't know what stopped you talking, but I can guess. They're coming. The angels are coming for you. But listen, your life could depend on this. Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink. Good luck.
SALLY: No! Don't! You can't!
LARRY: I'll rewind him.
SALLY: What good would that do? You're not looking at the statue.
LARRY: Neither are you.
SALLY: Keep looking at it. Keep looking at it.
LARRY: There's just one, right, there's just this one. We're okay if we just keep staring at this one statue. Everything's going to be fine.
SALLY: There are three more.
LARRY: Three?
SALLY: They were upstairs before, but I think I heard them moving.
LARRY: Moving where? Three of them? Moving where?
SALLY: I'm going to look around. I'm going to check. You keep looking at this one. Don't blink. Remember what he said. Don't even blink.
LARRY: Who blinks? I'm too scared to blink.
SALLY: Okay, we're going to the door. The front door.
 Okay. We can't both get to the front door without taking our eyes off that thing, so you stay here.
LARRY: What?
SALLY: I'll be just round the corner. You stay here. They've locked it. They've locked us in!
LARRY: Why?
SALLY : I've got something they want.
LARRY: What?
SALLY: The key. I took it last time I was here. They followed me to get it back. I led them to the blue box. Now they've got that.
LARRY: Well, give them the key.
SALLY: I'm going to check the back door. You wait here.
LARRY: Give them the key! Give them what they want! Sally, no. What if they come behind me?
SALLY : Hang on!
LARRY: Oh, God. Oh, God.
SALLY : It's locked!
LARRY: Sally! Sally!
SALLY : It won't open!
LARRY: Sally, please, I can't do this! Sally, hurry up! Where are you?
SALLY: Larry? They've blocked off the back door, but there's a cellar. There might be a way out. A delivery hatch or something.
LARRY: Coming! I can't stay here.
SALLY: Okay, boys, I know how this works. You can't move so long as I can see you. Whole world in the box, the Doctor says. Hope he's not lying, because I don't see how else we're getting out.
SALLY: Oh, and there's your one.
LARRY: Why's it pointing at the light?
SALLY: Oh, my God, it's turning out the lights.
LARRY: Quickly!
SALLY: I can't find the lock!
LARRY: Sally, hurry up! Get it open! They're getting closer. Sally, come on!
SALLY: It won't turn!
LARRY: Sally!
DOCTOR : This is security protocol seven one two. This time capsule has detected the presence of an authorised control disc, valid one journey.
DOCTOR : Please insert the disc and prepare for departure.
SALLY: Looks like a DVD player. There's a slot.
LARRY: They're trying to get in!
SALLY: Well, hurry up then!
LARRY: What's happening?
SALLY: Oh, my God, it's leaving us behind. Doctor, no! You can't!
SALLY: Doctor!
SALLY: Look at them! Quick, look at them!
LARRY: I don't think we need to. He tricked them, The Doctor tricked them. They're looking at each other. They're never going to move again.
LARRY: Can you mind the shop? I'm just nipping next door for some milk.
SALLY: Yeah. No worries.
LARRY: What's this?
SALLY: Nothing.
LARRY: Sally, can't you let it go?
SALLY: Of course I can't let it go.
LARRY: This is over.
SALLY: How did the Doctor know where to write the words on the wall? How could he get a copy of the transcript? Where did he get all that information from?
LARRY: Look, some things you never find out. And that's okay.
SALLY: No, it isn't.
LARRY: Ever think this might be getting in the way of other things?
SALLY: We just run a shop together. That's all it is, just a shop.
LARRY: Anyway, milk. Back in a mo.
SALLY: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hello. Sorry, bit of a rush. There's a sort of thing happening. Fairly important we stop it.
SALLY: My God, it's you. It really is you. Oh, you don't remember me, do you?
MARTHA: Doctor, we haven't have time for this. The migration's started.
DOCTOR: Look, sorry, I've got a bit of a complex life. Things don't always happen to me in quite the right order. Gets a bit confusing at times, especially at weddings. I'm rubbish at weddings, especially my own.
SALLY: Oh, my God, of course. You're a time traveller. It hasn't happened to you yet. None of it. It's still in your future.
DOCTOR: What hasn't happened?
MARTHA: Doctor, please. Twenty minutes to red hatching.
SALLY: It was me. Oh, for God's sake, it was me all along. You got it all from me.
DOCTOR: Got what?
SALLY: Okay, listen. One day you're going to get stuck in 1969. Make sure you've got this with you. You're going to need it.
MARTHA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Yeah, listen, listen, got to dash. Things happening. Well, four things. Well, four things and a lizard.
SALLY: Okay. No worries. On you go. See you around some day.
DOCTOR: What was your name?
SALLY: Sally Sparrow.
DOCTOR: Good to meet you, Sally Sparrow.
SALLY: Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Don't blink.
DOCTOR : Blink and you're dead. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink. Good luck.
