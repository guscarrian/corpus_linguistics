Fear Her
POSTMAN: Morning, love.
WOMAN: Morning.
DALE: Yes!
WOMAN: Hiya!
TOM'S DAD: All right?
TRISH: Maeve? Are you okay?
MAEVE: No, love, I'm not.
TRISH: Do you want me to call a doctor?
MAEVE: Doctor can't help. Can't you, can't you feel it, Trish?
TRISH: I can't feel anything.
MAEVE: Boys, get indoors! Get inside! Get them inside!
TOM'S DAD: What's up with you? They ain't done nothing wrong.
MAEVE: It's happening again!
CHLOE:  Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.
MAEVE: They're not safe.
TOM'S DAD: They're in the garden.
MAEVE: That's what it likes. It likes it when they're playing. Get them in, I'm begging you.
CHLOE: Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.
TOM'S DAD: It's all right. I've got my beady eyes on them. Come on.
MAEVE: But, I
TOM'S DAD: Come on.
MAEVE: No!
TOM'S DAD: Tom?
MAEVE: What are you?
TOM'S DAD: Where's he gone?
MAEVE : What do you want with our children??
DOCTOR: Ah.
DOCTOR: Ah!
ROSE: So, near future, yeah?
DOCTOR: I had a passing fancy. Only it didn't pass, it stopped.
DOCTOR: Thirtieth Olympiad.
ROSE: No way! Why didn't I think of this? That's great.
DOCTOR: Only seems like yesterday a few naked Greek blokes were tossing a discus about, wrestling each other in the sand with crowds stood around baying. No, wait a minute, that was Club Med. Just in time for the opening doo dah, ceremony, tonight, I thought you'd like that. Last one they had in London was dynamite. Wembley, 1948. I loved it so much, I went back and watched it all over again. Fella carrying the torch. Lovely chap, what was his?
DOCTOR: Mark? John? Mark? Legs like pipe cleaners, but strong as a whippet.
ROSE: Doctor.
DOCTOR: And in those days, everybody had a tea party to go to.
ROSE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Did you ever have one of those little cakes with the crunchy ball bearings on top?
ROSE: You should really look at this.
DOCTOR: Do you know those things? Nobody else in this entire galaxy's ever even bothered to make edible ball bearings. Genius.
DOCTOR: What's taking them, do you think? Snatching children from a thoroughly ordinary street like this. Why's it so cold? Is someone reducing the temperature?
ROSE: It says they all went missing this week. Why would a person do something like this?
DOCTOR: What makes you think it's a person?
ROSE: Whatever it is, it's got the whole street scared to death. Doctor, what
KEL: There you go. Fifth today. Not natural, is it?
DRIVER: I don't know what happened, I had it serviced less than a month ago.
KEL: Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate. All the cars are doing it. And do you know what? It's bonkers. Bonkers. Come on then, pal. I'll help you shift it. Quicker you're on the way, happier you'll be.
KEL: There we go.
ROSE: Do you want a hand?
KEL: No, we're all right, love.
ROSE: You're not. I'm tougher than I look, honest.
ROSE: Does this happen a lot?
DRIVER: Cheers, mate!
KEL: Been doing it all week.
ROSE: Since those children started going missing?
KEL: Yeah, I suppose so.
DOCTOR: Ooo, tickles!
TOM'S DAD: What's your game?
DOCTOR: My er. Snakes and Ladders? Quite good at squash. Reasonable. I'm being facetious, aren't I. There's no call for it.
KEL: Every car cuts out. The council are going nuts. I mean, they've given this street the works. Renamed it. I've been tarmacking every pot hole. Look at that. Beauty, init? Yeah! And all that is because that Olympic Torch comes right by the end of this Close. Just down there. Everything's got to be perfect, ain't it? Only it ain't.
MAEVE: It takes them when they're playing.
ROSE: What takes them?
MAEVE: Danny, Jane, Dale. Snatched in the blink of an eye.
DOCTOR: I'm, I'm a police officer! That's what I am. I've got a badge and a police car. You don't have to get. I can, I can prove it. Just hold on.
TOM'S DAD: We've had plenty of coppers poking around here, and you don't look or sound like any of them.
DOCTOR: See, look. I've got a colleague. Lewis.
TOM'S DAD: Well, she looks less like a copper than you do.
DOCTOR: Training. New recruit. It was either that or hairdressing, so, voila!
TRISH: What are you going to do?
MAEVE: The police have knocked on every door. No clues, no leads, nothing.
TOM'S DAD: Look, kids run off sometimes, all right? That's what they do.
MAEVE: Saw it with me own eyes. Dale Hicks in your garden, playing with your Tommy, and then pfft! Right in front of me, like he was never there. There's no need to look any further than this street. It's right here amongst us.
DOCTOR: Why don't we
WOMAN: Why don't we start with him? There's been all sorts like him in this street, day and night.
KEL: Fixing things up for the Olympics.
TOM'S DAD: Yeah, and taking an awful long time about it.
DOCTOR: I'm of the opinion that all we've got to do is just
KEL: You don't. What you just said, that's slander!
WOMAN: I don't care what it is.
DOCTOR: I think we need to just
KEL: I want an apology off her.
MAEVE: Stop picking on him.
KEL: Yeah, stop picking on me.
MAEVE: And stop pretending to be blind. It's evil!
WOMAN: I don't believe in evil.
KEL: Oh no, you just believe in tarmackers with sack loads of kidnapped kiddies in their van.
TOM'S DAD: Here, here, here, that's not what she's saying.
KEL: Would you stop ganging up on me.
WOMAN: Feeling guilty, are we?
DOCTOR: Fingers on lips!
DOCTOR: In the last six days, three of your children have been stolen. Snatched out of thin air, right?
MAEVE: Er, can I? Look around you. This was a safe street till it came. It's not a person. I'll say it if no one else will. Maybe you're coppers, maybe you're not. I don't care who you are. Can you please help us?
ROSE: Want a hanky?
DOCTOR: Can you smell it? What does it remind you of?
ROSE: Sort of metal?
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm.
ROSE: Oh.
DOCTOR: Danny Edwards cycled in one end but never came out the other. Whoa, there it goes again! Look at the hairs on the back of my manly hairy hand.
ROSE: And there's that smell. It's like a er, a burnt fuse plug or something.
DOCTOR: There's a residual energy in the spots where the kids vanished. Whatever it was, it used an awful lot of power to do this.
TRISH: You have to come down some time, Chloe.
CHLOE: I'm busy, mum.
TRISH: Look at it in here. You must've used up half a rainforest.
TRISH: That's Dale. Why did you draw him so sad?
CHLOE: I didn't draw him like that. Dale made himself sad, so I'm going to draw him a friend. That's what he needs. More friends.
TRISH: Have you seen the TV?
TRISH: Look, this'll cheer you up. The Torch is getting close. It'll pass right by our street. And tonight they'll light the Olympic Flame in the stadium, and the whole world will be looking at our city. I mean, doesn't that make you feel part of something? Sweetheart? Chloe?
CHLOE: I'm busy, mum.
HUW EDWARDS : Danny Fairweather carries the torch past them on this wonderful summer's day. Very fitting. We've seen lots of our sporting royalty, too.
TRISH: Okay. You're tired, Chloe. I heard you calling out again, last night.
CHLOE: It's fine.
TRISH: Nightmares?
CHLOE: I'm drawing!
TRISH: Whatever they are, they're just dreams, you do know that? They can't hurt you.
CHLOE: I'm busy. Unless you want me to draw you, mum.
TRISH: If you want to stay cooped up in here, fine. I'll leave you to it.
ROSE: Aren't you a beautiful boy??
DOCTOR: Thanks! I'm experimenting with back combing. Oh.
ROSE: I used to have one like you. What?
DOCTOR: No, I'm not really a cat person. Once you've been threatened by one in a nun's wimple, it kind of takes the joy out of it.
ROSE: Come here, puss. What do you want to go in there for?
ROSE: Doctor! Phew.
DOCTOR: Whoa! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Ion residue. Blimey! That takes some doing. Just to snatch a living organism out of space-time. This baby is just like, I'm having some of that. I'm impressed.
ROSE: So the cat's been transported?
DOCTOR: It can harness huge reserves of ionic power. We need to find the source of that power. Find the source and you will find whatever has taken to stealing children and fluffy animals. See what you can see. Keep them peeled, Lewis.
CHLOE: I've given you friends and you still moan. Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky. You're all together. You don't know what it is to be alone. If you did, you'd be thanking me. No! 
 
ROSE: Is that you, puss cat? Are you trapped?
ROSE: Not going to open it, not going to open it, not going to open it
DOCTOR: Stay still!
DOCTOR: Okey dokey?
ROSE: Yeah, cheers.
DOCTOR: No probs. I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me what the hell it is, because I haven't got the foggiest.
ROSE: Well, I can tell you you've just killed it.
DOCTOR: It was never living. It's animated by energy. Same energy that's snatching people. That is so dinky! The go anywhere creature. Fits in your pocket, makes friends, impresses the boss, breaks the ice at parties.
DOCTOR: Oh, hi ho, here we go. Let's have a look. Get out of here.
ROSE: What's it say?
DOCTOR: It is. It's graphite. Basically the same material as an HB pencil.
ROSE: I was attacked by a pencil scribble?
DOCTOR: Scribble creature, brought into being with ionic energy. Whatever we're dealing with, it can create things as well as take them. But why make a scribble creature?
ROSE: Maybe it was a mistake I mean, you scribble over something when you want to get rid of it, like a, like a drawing. Like a, a child's drawing. You said it was in the street.
DOCTOR: Probably.
ROSE: The girl.
DOCTOR: Of course! What girl?
ROSE: Something about her gave me the creeps. Even her own mum looked scared of her.
DOCTOR: Are you deducting?
ROSE: I think I am.
DOCTOR: Copper's hunch?
ROSE: Permission to follow it up, Sarge?
DOCTOR: Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Rose. Can we see your daughter?
TRISH: No, you can't.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bye.
TRISH: Why? Why do you want to see Chloe?
DOCTOR: Well, there's some interesting stuff going on in this street, and I just thought. Well, we thought, that she might like to give us a hand.
ROSE: Sorry to bother you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, sorry. We'll let you get on with things. On your own. Bye again.
TRISH: Wait! Can you help her?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can.
HUW EDWARDS : The Torch Bearer is running up the Mall, which I can tell you is
TRISH: She stays in her room most of the time. I try talking to her, but it's like trying to speak to a brick wall. She gives me nothing, just asks to be left alone.
ROSE: What about Chloe's dad?
TRISH: Chloe's dad died a year ago.
ROSE: I'm sorry.
TRISH: You wouldn't be if you'd known him.
DOCTOR: Well, let's go and say hi.
TRISH: I should check on her first. She might be asleep.
DOCTOR: Why are you afraid of her, Trish?
TRISH: I want you to know before you see her that's she's really a great kid.
DOCTOR: I'm sure she is.
TRISH: She's never been in trouble at school you should see her report from last year. A's and B's.
ROSE: Can I use your loo?
TRISH: She's in the choir. She's singing in an old folks home. Any mum would be proud. You know I want you to know these things before you see her, Doctor, because right now, she's not herself. 
DOCTOR: All right, there? I'm the Doctor.
CHLOE: I'm Chloe Webber.
DOCTOR: How're you doing, Chloe Webber?
CHLOE: I'm busy. I'm making something, aren't I, mum.
TRISH: And like I said, she's not been sleeping.
DOCTOR: But you've been drawing, though. I'm rubbish. Stick men about my limit. Can do this, though.
DOCTOR: Can you do that?
CHLOE: They don't stop moaning.
TRISH: Chloe.
CHLOE: I try to help them, but they don't stop moaning.
DOCTOR: Who don't?
CHLOE: We can be together.
TRISH: Sweetheart.
CHLOE: Don't touch me, mum.
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming.
CHLOE: I'm busy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on, Chloe. Don't be a spoil sport. What's the big project? I'm dying to know. What're you making up there?
ROSE : Doctor!
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you.
ROSE: Look at it.
DOCTOR: No, ta.
TRISH: What the hell was that?
ROSE: A drawing. The face of a man.
TRISH: What face?
ROSE: Best not.
TRISH: What've you been drawing?
CHLOE: I'm drew him yesterday.
TRISH: Who?
CHLOE: Dad.
TRISH: Your dad? But he's long gone. Chloe, with all the lovely things in the world, why him?
CHLOE: I dream about him, staring at me.
TRISH: I thought we were putting him behind us. What's the matter with you?
CHLOE: We need to stay together.
TRISH: Yes, we do.
CHLOE: No. Not you, us. We need to stay together, and then it'll be all right.
ROSE: Trish, the drawings. Have you seen what Chloe's drawings can do?
TRISH: Who gave you permission to come into her room? Get out of my house.
DOCTOR: Tell us about the drawings, Chloe.
TRISH: I don't want to hear any more of this.
ROSE: But that drawing of her dad. I heard a voice. He spoke.
TRISH: He's dead. And these, they're kid's pictures. Now get out!
ROSE: Chloe has a power. And I don't know how, but she used it to take Danny Edwards, Dale Hicks. She's using it to snatch the kids.
TRISH: Get out.
ROSE: Have you seen those drawings move?
TRISH: I haven't seen anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, you have, out of the corner of your eye.
TRISH: No.
DOCTOR: And you dismissed it, because what choice do you have when you see something you can't possibly explain? You dismiss it, right? And if anyone mentions it, you get angry, so it's never spoken of, ever again.
TRISH: She's a child.
DOCTOR: You're terrified of her. But there's nowhere to turn to, because who's going to believe the things you see out of the corner of your eye? No one. Except me.
TRISH: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm help.
ROSE: Ahem.
ROSE: Those pictures, they're alive. She's drawing people and they end up in her pictures.
DOCTOR: Ionic energy. Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids and place them in some kid of holding pen made up of ionic power.
ROSE: And what about the dad from hell in her wardrobe?
TRISH: How many times do I have to tell you he's dead.
ROSE: Well, he's got a very loud voice for a dead bloke.
DOCTOR: If living things can become drawings, then maybe drawings can become living things. Chloe's real dad is dead, but not the one who visits her in her nightmares. That dad seems very real. That's the dad she's drawn and he's a heartbeat away from crashing into this world.
TRISH: She always got the worst of it when he was alive.
ROSE: Doctor, how can a twelve year old girl be doing any of this?
DOCTOR: Let's find out.
DOCTOR: Nice one.
DOCTOR: There we go.
TRISH: I can't let him do this
ROSE: Shush, it's okay. Trust him.
DOCTOR: Now we can talk.
CHLOE: I want Chloe. Wake her up. I want Chloe.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
CHLOE: I want Chloe Webber.
TRISH: What've you done to my little girl?
ROSE: Doctor, what is it?
DOCTOR: I'm speaking to you, the entity that is using this human child. I request parley in compliance with the Shadow Proclamation.
CHLOE: I don't care about shadows or parleys.
DOCTOR: So what do you care about?
CHLOE: I want my friends.
DOCTOR: You're lonely, I know. Identify yourself.
CHLOE: I am one of many. I travel with my brothers and sisters. We take an endless journey. A thousand of your lifetimes. But now I am alone. I hate it. It's not fair, and I hate it.
DOCTOR: Name yourself!
CHLOE: Isolus.
DOCTOR: You're Isolus. Of course.
CHLOE: Our journey began in the Deep Realms when we were a family.
TRISH: What's that?
DOCTOR: The Isolus Mother, drifting in deep space. See, she jettisons millions of fledgling spores. Her children. The Isolus are empathic beings of intense emotions, but when they're cast off from their mother, their empathic link, their need for each other, is what sustains them. They need to be together. They cannot be alone.
CHLOE: Our journey is long.
DOCTOR: The Isolus children travel, each inside a pod. They ride the heat and energy of solar tides. It takes thousands and thousands of years for them to grow up.
ROSE: Thousands of years just floating through space. Poor things. Don't they go mad with boredom?
CHLOE: We play.
ROSE: You play?
DOCTOR: While they travel, they play games. They use their ionic power to literally create make believe worlds in which to play.
ROSE: In flight entertainment.
DOCTOR: Helps keep them happy. While they're happy, they can feed off each others love. Without it, they're lost. Why did you come to Earth?
CHLOE: We were too close.
DOCTOR: That's a solar flare from your sun. Would have made a tidal wave of solar energy that scattered the Isolus pods.
CHLOE: Only I fell to Earth. My brothers and sisters are left up there, and I cannot reach them. So alone.
DOCTOR: Your pod crashed. Where is it?
CHLOE: My pod was drawn to heat, and I was drawn to Chloe Webber. She was like me, alone. She needed me, and I her.
DOCTOR: You empathised with her. You wanted to be with her because she was alone like you.
CHLOE: I want my family. It's not fair.
DOCTOR: I understand. You want to make a family. But you can't stay in this child. It's wrong. You can't steal any more friends for yourself.
CHLOE: I am alone.
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming.
DOCTOR: Trish, how do you calm her?
TRISH: What?
DOCTOR: When she has nightmares, what do you do?
TRISH: I, I
DOCTOR: What do you do?
TRISH: I sing to her.
DOCTOR: Then start singing.
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe, I'm coming.
TRISH: Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry, merry king of the bush is he
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe.
TRISH: Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.
TRISH: He came to her because she was lonely. Chloe, I'm sorry.
TRISH: Chloe usually got the brunt of his temper when he'd had a drink. The day he crashed the car, I thought we were free. I thought it was over.
ROSE: Did you talk to her about it?
TRISH: I didn't want to.
ROSE: But maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone. Because she has all these terrible dreams about her dad, but she can't talk to you about them.
DOCTOR: Her and the Isolus. Two lonely kids who need each other.
ROSE: And it won't stop, will it, Doctor? It'll just keep pulling kids in.
DOCTOR: It's desperate to be loved. It's used to a pretty big family.
ROSE: How big?
DOCTOR: Say around four billion?
HUW EDWARDS : The queues started a week ago for those desperate enough to be inside, and lots of them are expecting a capacity crowd of eighty thousand for this evening's opening ceremony. I have to say there's been
DOCTOR: We need that pod.
ROSE: It crashed. Won't it be destroyed?
DOCTOR: Well, it's been sucking in all the heat it can. Hopefully that should keep it in a fit state to launch. It must be close. It should have a weak energy signature that the Tardis can trace. Once we find it, then we can stop the Isolus.
TRISH: She's running a temperature. I can't go into that now, Kirsty. Yes, we've got a doctor.
TRISH: Yeah, he said he can help her.
DOCTOR: We can scan for the same trace that I picked up from the scribble creature. We'd need to widen the field a bit.
ROSE: You knew the Isolus was lonely before it told you. How?
DOCTOR: I know what it's like to travel a long way on your own. Give me the styner-magnetic. The thing in your left hand.
ROSE: Sounds like you're on its side.
DOCTOR: I sympathise, that's all.
ROSE: The Isolus has caused a lot of pain for these people.
DOCTOR: It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe. Two lonely mixed up kids.
ROSE: Feels to me like a temper tantrum because it can't get its own way.
DOCTOR: It's scared. Come on, you were a kid once. Binary dot.
ROSE: Yes, and I know what kids can be like. Right little terrors.
DOCTOR: Gum.
ROSE: I've got cousins. Kids can't have it all their own way. That's part of being a family.
DOCTOR: What about trying to understand them?
ROSE: Easy for you to say. You don't have kids.
DOCTOR: I was a dad once.
ROSE: What did you say?
DOCTOR: I think we're there. Fear, loneliness. They're the big ones, Rose. Some of the most terrible acts ever committed have been inspired by them. We're not dealing with something that wants to conquer or destroy. There's a lot of things you need to get across this universe. Warp drive, wormhole refractors. You know the thing you need most of all? You need a hand to hold.
ROSE: No, Look, I'm pointing.
DOCTOR: It's the pod! It is in the street. Everything's coming up Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's about two inches across. Dull grey, like a gull's egg. Very light.
ROSE: So these pods they travel from sun to sun using heat, yeah? So it's not all about love and stuff. Doesn't the pod just need heat?
ROSE: Doctor?
ROSE: Doctor!
TRISH: It's okay. I've taken all the pencils off her.
CHLOE: Leave me alone. I want to be with Chloe Webber. I love Chloe Webber.
ROSE: Bring him back, now.
CHLOE: No.
ROSE: Don't you realise what you've done? He was the only one who could help you. Now bring him back!
CHLOE: Leave me alone! I love Chloe Webber!
ROSE: I know. I know. Doctor, if you can hear me, I'm going to get you out of there. I'll find the pod.  Don't leave her alone, no matter what.
HUW EDWARDS : The Torch Bearer getting even closer to the Olympic Stadium heading down the Strand before turning east along the Embankment.
ROSE: Heat. They travel on heat.
KEL: Look at this finish. Smooth as a baby's bottom. Not a bump or a lump.
ROSE: Kel, was there anything in this street in the last few days giving off a lot of heat?
KEL: I mean, you can eat your dinner off this. Beautiful. So you tell me why the other one's got a lump in it when I gave it the same love and craftsmanship as I did this one.
ROSE: Well, when you've worked it out, put it in a big book about tarmacking, but before you do that, think back six days.
KEL: Six days. When I was laying this the first time round.
ROSE: What?
KEL: Well, that's when I filled in this pothole for the first time.
ROSE: Six days ago.
KEL: Yeah.
ROSE: Hot fresh tar.
KEL: Blended to a secret council recipe.
KEL: I don't keep it in the van! Hey, that's a council van. Out.
KEL: Whoa, wait, wait, wait. You just removed a council axe from a council van. Put it back. No, don't, wait. Put the axe back in the van. That's my van. Give me the axe. No! Wait! No!
KEL: No! You, stop! You just took a council axe from a council van and now you're digging up a council road! I'm reporting you to the council!
ROSE: It went for the hottest thing in the street. Your tar.
KEL: What is it?
ROSE: It's a spaceship. Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid.
HUW EDWARDS : We're live on News 24. The opening ceremony of the London Olympics of 2012 is well underway, and people from all over the world are streaming into the stadium right now. They all have their dreams. They've all put in years of hard work 
ROSE: I've found it! I don't know what to do with it, but maybe the Isolus will just hop on board. Hang on, I told you not to leave her.
HUW EDWARDS : My God! Er, what's going on here?
KEL: I don't care if you've got Snow White and the Seven Dwarves buried under there, you don't go digging up
ROSE: Shut up and look!
HUW EDWARDS : The crowd has vanished! Er, they're gone. Everyone has gone. Thousands of people have just gone. Right in front of my eyes. It's impossible. Bob, can we join you in the box? Bob? Not you too, Bob?
ROSE: The stadium won't be enough. The Isolus has four billion brothers and sisters.
HUW EDWARDS : Over eighty thousand spectators and thirteen thousand athletes.
CHLOE: Not enough.
HUW EDWARDS : They're gone. All of those people. It's a terrible, terrible turn of events.
CHLOE: We won't be alone, Chloe Webber. We'll have all of them. And then we'll never feel alone, ever again.
HUW EDWARDS : Since the battle of Torchwood.
ROSE : Chloe? Chloe, it's Rose! Open the door!
ROSE: We found your ship. We can send you home.
TRISH: Chloe?
ROSE: Open up! Right, stand back.
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. 
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming, coming to hurt you.
ROSE: Chloe!
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you. I'm coming.
ROSE: I've got to stop her.
CHLOE: If you stop Chloe Webber, I will let him out. We will let him out together. I cannot be alone. It's not fair.
ROSE: Look, I've got your pod.
CHLOE: The pod is dead.
ROSE: It only needs heat.
CHLOE: It needs more than heat.
ROSE: What, then?
KEL: I'm not being funny or nothing, but that picture just moved. And that one!
ROSE: She didn't draw that, he did. But it needs more than heat, Doctor.
HUW EDWARDS : Is still on its way. I suppose it's much more than a torch now, it's a beacon. It's a beacon of hope and fortitude and courage. And it's a beacon of love.
ROSE: Love.
HUW EDWARDS : So let's have a look from the helicopter. There we go, the torch bearer running
ROSE: I know how to charge up the pod.
HUW EDWARDS: Past Dame Kelly Holmes Close.
POLICEMAN: Sorry, you'll have to watch from here.
ROSE: No, I've got to get closer.
POLICEMAN: No way.
ROSE: I can stop this from happening!
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe.
TRISH: Chloe.
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming to hurt you.
TRISH: She's my baby! You're not going to hurt her again!
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming.
ROSE: You felt it, didn't you? Feel the love.
ROSE: Yes!
CHLOE: I can go home. Goodbye, Chloe Webber. I love you.
CHLOE: Mum?
TRISH: I'm here.
CHLOE: Mummy!
KEL: You did it! What was it you did?
DALE: Mummy!
JANE'S MOTHER: Oh, Jane!
ROSE: Doctor.
MAEVE: I don't know who you are, or what you did, but thank you, darling! And thank that man for me too.
ROSE: Where is he? He should be here. All the drawings have come to life. That means all of them. Oh, no.
ROSE: Trish, get out!
TRISH: I can't! The door's stuck!
ROSE: Is the Doctor in there?
TRISH: I don't think so.
CHLOE: Mummy.
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you.
CHLOE: Please, dad. No more.
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe
ROSE: Chloe, listen to me. It isn't real like the others. It's just energy left over by the Isolus, but you can get rid of it.
TRISH: Help us!
ROSE: Oh, it's because you're so scared that he's real. But you can get shot of him, Chloe.
CHLOE: Mummy!
ROSE: You can do it, Chloe!
CHLOE: I can't!
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe, I'm coming.
CHLOE: I can't! I can't!
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming.
CHLOE: I can't.
CHLOE'S DAD : I'm coming.
CHLOE: Mummy.
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe.
TRISH: I'm with you, Chloe. You're not alone. You'll never be alone again.
ROSE: Sing again! Chloe, sing!
CHLOE'S DAD : Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe. Chloe, I'm coming to hurt you. Chloe!
CHLOE + TRISH: Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.
CHLOE + TRISH: Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree. Merry merry king of the bush is he. Laugh, Kookaburra, laugh, Kookaburra, gay your life must be.
KEL: Maybe he's gone somewhere.
ROSE: Who's going to hold his hand now?
HUW EDWARDS : Just look at this! Utterly incredibly scenes at the Olympic stadium. Eighty thousand athletes and spectators. They disappeared, they've come back!
HUW EDWARDS : They've returned. They've reappeared. It's quite incredible. Bob, this will certainly
ROSE: Eighty thousand people, so where's the Doctor? I need him.
HUW EDWARDS : But hang on, the Torch Bearer seems to be in a bit of trouble. We did see a flash of lightning earlier that seemed to strike him. Maybe he's injured. He's definitely in trouble.
HUW EDWARDS : Does this mean that the Olympic dream is dead?
ROSE: Doctor.
HUW EDWARDS : There's a mystery man. He's picked up the flame. We've no idea who he is. He's carrying the flame. Yes, he's carrying the flame and no one wants to stop him. It's more than a flame now, Bob. It's more than heat and light. It's hope, and it's courage, and it's love.
DOCTOR: Go on. Join your brothers and sisters. They'll be waiting.
ROSE: Cake?
DOCTOR: Top banana. Mmm. I can't stress this enough. Ball bearings you can eat, masterpiece!
ROSE: I thought I'd lost you.
DOCTOR: Nah. Not on a night like this. This is a night for lost things being found. Come on.
ROSE: What now?
DOCTOR: I want to go to the Games. It's what we came for.
ROSE: Go on, give us a clue. Which events do we do well in?
DOCTOR: Well, I will tell you this. Papua New Guinea surprises everyone in the shot put.
ROSE: Really? You're joking, aren't you? Doctor, are you serious or are you joking?
DOCTOR: Wait and see.
ROSE: You know what? They keep on trying to split us up, but they never ever will.
DOCTOR: Never say never ever.
ROSE: Nah, we'll always be okay, you and me. Don't you reckon, Doctor?
DOCTOR: There's something in the air. Something coming.
ROSE: What?
DOCTOR: A storm's approaching.
