The Witch's Familiar
MISSY: Consider the Doctor. The Doctor, trapped. The Doctor, alone. You all right there, dear?
CLARA: Where are we? How did we ?
MISSY: Shh, now. Mummy's talking. Okay, I'm going to tell you a story of the Doctor. It's classic. On the run, no Tardis. No friends, no help. In other words, the Doctor, happy. It was a long time ago.
MISSY: Doesn't matter which face he was wearing, they're all the Doctor to me. So let's give it to the eyebrows.
CLARA: But the Daleks
MISSY: Yes, I'm coming to that.
CLARA: Shouldn't we be, um? I don't want to say dead.
MISSY: Hush! He's travelling by teleporter. Unfortunately, his teleporter is out of power. Also unfortunate, he's being stalked by, oh, say about fifty android assassins? I may be rounding up.
MISSY: Ow. Fifty invisible, indestructible android assassins, all exclusively programmed to kill him.
CLARA: Why are you sharpening that stick?
MISSY: Well, I've no idea how long we're going to be stuck out here. Might have to go hunting.
CLARA: So why am I tied up?
MISSY: In case there's nothing to hunt.
MISSY: The Doctor, then. Surrounded. Outnumbered. Outgunned. And freeze. Nanoseconds to live. Four, I'd say, being generous. Now, my question is this. How did he survive?
MISSY: Oh, come on, Clara! You know him. Consider the Doctor.
CLARA: Where did he get that teleport thingy?
MISSY: Oh, good, good. He stole one from an android.
CLARA: So, I'm guessing he uses the same energy as the android weapons, right?
MISSY: Excellent! Not seeing you as sandwiches now.
CLARA: Okay, then. He uses the energy wave from the android weapons to recharge the teleport bracelet and at the exact moment he's supposed to disintegrate,
CLARA: He actually teleports. Hang on, that's how you did it. That's how we escaped the Daleks.
MISSY: I modified the same principle for our vortex manipulators, yes. Blew them off, I'm afraid. But the Doctor, he, he improvised it. He must have got through several thousand calculations in the time it takes to fire up a disintegrator. Seriously, what a swot!
CLARA: So the androids think he's dead and the Doctor escapes.
MISSY: No, he's the Doctor. He fell into a nest of vampire monkeys.
MISSY: But that's another story!
CLARA: Oh!
MISSY: Why does the Doctor always survive?
CLARA: Because he's clever.
MISSY: Yes, but there's lots of clever dead people. I love killing clever clogs, they make the best faces.
CLARA: Because he always assumes he's going to win. He always knows there's a way to survive. He just has to go and find it.
MISSY: Yes, except this time, he made a will and threw himself a goodbye party. Now, if the Doctor assumes he's going to die, what happens then?
CLARA: We do.
MISSY: He's trapped at the heart of the Dalek empire. He's a prisoner of the creatures who hate him most in the universe. Between us and him is everything the deadliest race in all of history can throw at us. We, on the other hand, have a pointy stick. How do we start?
CLARA: We assume we're going to win.
MISSY: Oh. Pity, really. I was actually quite peckish.
CLARA: Can I have a stick too?
MISSY: Make your own stick.
DAVROS: It took me so very long to realise it was you, standing at the gates of my beginning. And here you are at the end.
DAVROS: But this time, I have you at my mercy. Exterminate.
DAVROS: Ancient. Inoperable.
DOCTOR: Genius.
DAVROS: You would threaten a dying man? Have I not suffered enough?
DOCTOR: Get out.
DAVROS: I cannot leave this chamber. It sustains me.
DOCTOR: Get out!
DALEK: Alert! Alert! The infirmary is breached.
DALEK SUPREME: Protect Davros. Davros must be assisted.
DALEK: Davros is leaving the infirmary.
DALEK SUPREME: Davros must remain. Davros cannot leave.
DAVROS : My children! Help me!
DALEK SUPREME: You must return to the infirmary.
DAVROS : The Doctor is escaping. Find him. Find the Doctor.
DALEK SUPREME: Find the Doctor! Seek, locate, destroy!
 
DALEKS: Seek, locate, destroy. Seek, locate.
BATTLE DALEK: Exterminate the Doctor!
DALEKS : Exterminate the Doctor! Exterminate!
CLARA: What's happening?
MISSY: What do you think?
CLARA: He's in the middle of that?
MISSY: Ah, that's what we need.
DAVROS : Assist me!
DALEK: Davros approaches.
DALEK SUPREME: Admit Davros. Admit the creator.
DAVROS: Help me!
DALEK SUPREME: Assist Davros. Assist.
DOCTOR: Admit it. You've all had this exact nightmare.
DAVROS: Get me Sarff!
COLONY SARFF: I am here.
DOCTOR: So,anyone for dodgems?
DALEK SUPREME: Exterminate!
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate!
CLARA: Daleks have sewers?
MISSY: With one significant difference.
CLARA: Being?
MISSY: They're ever so slightly alive.
CLARA: They're what?
MISSY: How much of a drop would you say that is? Can you see the bottom?
CLARA: Too dark. Er, we could chuck a stone down, or something.
MISSY: Oh yeah, good idea.
CLARA: Oh!
MISSY: Twenty feet.
DOCTOR: Of course, the real question is, where did I get the cup of tea? Answer? I'm the Doctor. Just accept it.
DALEK SUPREME: You are unharmed.
DOCTOR: Proposition. Davros is an insane, paranoid genius who has survived among several billion trigger-happy mini-tanks for centuries. Conclusion? I'm definitely having his chair.
DALEK SUPREME: You cannot escape, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm guessing his personal forcefield only works in one direction.
DALEK SUPREME: The Doctor does not use weapons.
DOCTOR: Doesn't he? Ah, listen to your little hearts beat!
CLARA: Ah
MISSY: Hello.
MISSY: Oh, poppet. Do you really think you could?
CLARA: First chance I get.
MISSY: You won't survive down here on your own.
CLARA: You won't survive turning your back.
MISSY: Ooo. How exciting.
MISSY: God, you're dull.
MISSY: In future, if you're going to take my stick, do me the courtesy of actually killing me. Team work is all about respect.
CLARA: We're not a team.
MISSY: Of course we are. Every miner needs a canary. Now, hush, look around. Bit of a mess, isn't it?
CLARA: You said it was a sewer.
MISSY: Daleks don't generate much in the way of waste.
CLARA: So what is it all, then?
MISSY: Decaying Daleks. Daleks can't die. Genetically hard-wired to keep on living, whatever happens. Well. But they still age, poor loves. Over time, the body breaks down, rots, liquefies. Interestingly, the Dalek word for sewer is the same as their word for graveyard.
DOCTOR: Ask me what I want.
DALEK SUPREME: Irrelevant. You will not prevail. You will not succeed.
DOCTOR: I've been at the heart of your empire for forty two minutes, and I own it, and I haven't even got out of my chair. Ask me what I want.
DALEK SUPREME: What do you want?
DOCTOR: Clara Oswald.
DOCTOR: I want Clara Oswald, safe, alive, and returned to me immediately. You bring her back. You do that. You do that now. Unharmed. Unhurt. Alive.
DALEK SUPREME: Your associate
DOCTOR: I saw what happened. I was there. And I'm hoping, for all of our sakes, that it was a trick.
DALEK SUPREME: It was not a deception.
DOCTOR: Because if Clara Oswald is really dead, then you'd better be very, very careful how you tell me.
MISSY: Listen to that. The Doctor without hope.
DOCTOR : Who's going to tell me?
DOCTOR: Who's going to go first?
MISSY: Nobody is safe now.
DOCTOR : All the power Davros had is mine.
DOCTOR: Everything he had, I have.
DOCTOR : Who's going to tell me that Clara Oswald is really dead?
MISSY: He'll burn everything. Us too.
DALEK SUPREME: Clara Oswald is not alive.
DAVROS : Doctor, this urge for conquest. It is gratifying to see you learn.
DOCTOR: Davros. You're up. Sorry, this seat's taken.
DAVROS : Indeed. But not by you.
DAVROS : You've met my Head of Personal Security, I think. Colony Sarff. His agents are everywhere.
DAVROS: Are you ready?
COLONY SARFF: Of course.
DAVROS: Be subtle, Colony Sarff. Tonight, we entrap a Time Lord.
CLARA: What is that? A lift?
MISSY: What? Never mind the lift. See that thing on the wall?
CLARA: What about it?
MISSY: Take a look.
CLARA: What is it?
MISSY: Closer.
CLARA: What am I even looking for?
MISSY: Nothing. I'm giving it a good look at you.
DALEK : Intruder alert! Intruder alert!
CLARA: Why the hell did you do that?
MISSY: Ever ring a doorbell and run away?
DALEK : Humanoid detected in lower level.
MISSY: Not this time.
DALEK : Dalek to Lower Level Thirteen.
CLARA: What the hell did you do that for?
MISSY: We need to trap and kill a Dalek. You're the bait, I'm the hook.
MISSY: Dark star alloy. Goes through armour plating like a knife through people.
CLARA: Missy. Missy. Missy, uncuff me now!
MISSY: It's pretty, though, isn't it? Got it in the olden days on Gallifrey. The Doctor gave it to me when my daughter
MISSY: Keep it talking. We need to draw it out of the lift.
CLARA: You can't kill a Dalek with a brooch.
MISSY: Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
DALEK: Humanoid detected. Remain still. Do not move. Scan in progress. Humanoid unauthorised in restricted area.
DALEK: Sterilisation proceeding.
MISSY: Hey, you! Guess what? I just put a hole in you.
MISSY: And another and another. And another!
CLARA: What are you doing?
MISSY: Murdering a Dalek. I'm a Time Lady, it's our golf.
DALEK: Damage levels insignificant.
MISSY: Oh, really? I think you're forgetting you're surrounded by a bunch of very old, very angry Daleks.
MISSY:  You just got yourself a puncture in a bad neighbourhood. Meet the locals? All blind and squelchy and out of their tiny minds, but they can still smell! Nobody hates like a Dalek. Here they come! I think they want to steal your motor.
DALEK: Emergency! Emergency! My vision is impaired.
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate!
MISSY: Oh, here comes the older generation!
MISSY: These young folks today are so tetchy!
DALEK: Emergency! Emergency!
MISSY: Wheeeeeee!
YOUNG DAVROS: Help me! You can't leave me. You promised. You did! You said I could survive. You said you'd help me. Help me!
DAVROS: I hope you are grateful. It wasn't easy to procure. And very nearly unique, of course. You should feel privileged. The only other chair on Skaro.
DAVROS: Don't get up.
DOCTOR: You neither.
DAVROS: The chamber is sealed, and I believe you are not carrying your sonic device.
DOCTOR: I gave it up. Bad memories.
DAVROS: I am dying, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You keep saying that, you keep not dying. Can you give it some welly? Come on.
DAVROS: And it is time for us to conclude our business together.
DOCTOR: We have no business.
DAVROS: We have nothing but. Look again at the cables, Doctor. Understand what they are. What they can do. Just step a little closer.
MISSY: Get in.
DOCTOR: They don't have much respect for you, do they? Your kids. Have you seen the state of this place? I mean, this is exactly where you dump a smelly old uncle slash family pet slash genius scientist who couldn't even invent legs. Seriously, how do your boys take it when everybody else has got two eyes?
DAVROS: You know what it is, of course.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. It's a hyperspace relay, with some kind of a genetic component.
DAVROS: I am connected to the life force of every Dalek on this planet. It is what has kept me alive. As their hearts beat, so does mine.
DOCTOR: Ooo. Nice. Vampiring off your own creations, just to eke out your days. I'm surprised the Daleks allow it.
DAVROS: Oh, they have no choice. My Daleks are afflicted with a genetic defect.
DOCTOR: What defect?
DAVROS: Respect. Mercy for their father. Design flaws I was unable to eliminate. And now he sees it. Now he understands. The cables, Doctor. Touch them. Imagine, to hold in your hand the heartbeat of every Dalek on Skaro. They send me life. Is it beyond the wit of a Time Lord to send them death? A little work and it could be done.
DOCTOR: Er, why would you be telling me this?
DAVROS: Genocide in a moment. Such slaughter, not in self-defence. Not as a simple act of war. Genocide as a choice. Are you ready, Doctor? So many backs with a single knife.
DAVROS: Are you ready to be a god?
DAVROS: Why do you hesitate? No one would know. Clara Oswald is dead. Is this the conscience of the Doctor, or his shame? The shame that brought you here.
DOCTOR: There's no such thing as the Doctor. I'm just a bloke in a box, telling stories. And I didn't come here because I'm ashamed. A bit of shame never hurt anyone. I came because you're sick and you asked. And because sometimes, on a good day, if I try very hard, I'm not some old Time Lord who ran away. I'm the Doctor.
DAVROS: Compassion then.
DOCTOR: Always.
DAVROS: It grows strong and fierce in you, like a cancer.
DOCTOR: I hope so.
DAVROS: It will kill you in the end.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't die of anything else.
DAVROS: You may rely on it.
CLARA: How am I supposed to make it go? Are there pedals?
MISSY: Telepathic control. Open wide.
MISSY: I meant your skull. Never mind
CLARA: Ow!
MISSY: Shh, shh, now, don't worry.
CLARA: Ow.
MISSY: There's loads of nano-tech repairing any damage as the feed goes in.
CLARA: What about when it comes out?
MISSY: No idea. Nobody knows. Anyway, to control the unit, you just have to think. Novel idea for you, but let's try it. Move forwards.
CLARA: I don't know how to
MISSY: You see?
CLARA: Oh! How did I do that?
MISSY: Circle right.
CLARA: I can't
MISSY: Circle left. There you go. All right, this won't hurt a bit.
CLARA: Hang on. No, Missy. No, no, no, no! No, Missy. Missy, no, no, no, please don't! Don't, don't, please!
MISSY: Are you okay?
CLARA: Fine, I think.
DALEK: Fine, I think.
CLARA : Okay.
CLARA DALEK: Okay. That's a bit weird.
MISSY: Just a bit. Okay. All right. Shh. Say your name.
CLARA DALEK: Why?
MISSY: Just just say. Just say it.
CLARA : Clara.
CLARA DALEK: Dalek.
MISSY: Say it again.
CLARA : Clara Oswald.
CLARA DALEK: Dalek. Dalek.
MISSY: One more time.
CLARA : I am Clara Oswald! I'm Clara Oswald!
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek! I am a Dalek! I am a Dalek! I am a Dalek!
MISSY: Whoa! Just don't get emotional. Emotion fires the gun. Okay?
CLARA : I don't understand.
CLARA DALEK: I do not understand.
MISSY: Say I love you. Those exact words. Don't ask me why, just say it.
CLARA : I love you.
CLARA DALEK: Exterminate.
MISSY: Say, you are different from me.
CLARA : You are different from me.
CLARA DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate!
MISSY: Say, "Ex-ter-min-ate!"
CLARA : Exterminate.
CLARA DALEK: Exterminate!
CLARA DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
MISSY: Cybermen suppress emotion. Daleks channel it through a gun. That's why they keep yelling exterminate. It's how they reload. So, let's go and kill them. Come on.
DAVROS: There is a question, Doctor. One I have longed to ask.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, if you're going to put your hand on my knee, it isn't going to go well.
DAVROS: Why did you leave Gallifrey?
DOCTOR: Well, because I did.
DAVROS: You stole the Tardis, and ran and ran. Why?
DOCTOR: It's a boring place, Gallifrey. I was going out of my mind.
DAVROS: Yet you long to return.
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I'm inconsistent.
DAVROS: But it is always the same lie.
DOCTOR: What lie?
DAVROS: You weren't bored. No one runs the way you have run for so small a reason.
DOCTOR: I do.
DAVROS: No, you don't. Colony Sarff confiscated these items on your arrival.
DAVROS: A Time Lord confession dial, I believe. Your confession. Tell me. Send me to my grave with this precious knowledge. What is the Doctor's confession?
DOCTOR: Don't you dare!
DAVROS: Is it possible I have touched a nerve?
DOCTOR: Some things matter to me, Davros. Not many, but a few. And you don't put your fingers anywhere near them.
DOCTOR: And they'd better not be scratched. These are my best ones.
DAVROS: Still you play the fool.
DOCTOR: Well, by now that should make you nervous.
DALEK: Halt! Report.
CLARA : Humanoid intrud
CLARA DALEK: Humanoid intruder found on lower levels.
DALEK: Why has the intruder not been exterminated? Explain. Explain. Explain!
MISSY: I'm a prisoner of special significance. Count the hearts.
DALEK: You are a Time Lord?
MISSY: Time Lady, thank you. Some of us can afford the upgrade. Is it still the same old Supreme Dalek these days? I fought him once on the slopes of the Never Vault. Tell him the bitch is back.
DAVROS: Make your confession, Doctor. Why did you really leave Gallifrey?
DOCTOR: How long has it been, you and I?
DAVROS: Long enough. Galaxies have burned.
DOCTOR: And now you ask me a personal question?
DAVROS: You have slaughtered billions of my children, as I have slaughtered billions of your race. We have exhausted the conventional means of communication.
DOCTOR: My people are alive. They didn't die. I brought them back. I found a way.
DAVROS: Is this true?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey is back in the sky. I don't know where, I may never know. But Gallifrey is back and it is safe from both of us.
DAVROS: Doctor, my most sincere congratulations.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?
DAVROS: This is wonderful news. Beyond all hope. I congratulate you.
DOCTOR: Why are you saying that?
DAVROS: A man should have a race, a people, an allegiance. A man should belong, Doctor. Believe me, please. I am happy for you. So happy.
DOCTOR: I don't, I don't understand this. Why are you
DAVROS: Come closer again. Let me see your face.
DOCTOR: You've seen it often enough.
DAVROS: Let me see it again with my own eyes.
DAVROS: Closer, please.
DAVROS: If you have redeemed the Time Lords from the fire, do not lose them again. Take the darkest path into the deepest hell, but protect your own as I have sought to protect mine. Did I do right, Doctor? Tell me.
DAVROS: Was I right? I need to know before the end. Am I a good man?
DOCTOR: You really are dying, aren't you?
DAVROS: Look at me. Did you doubt it?
DOCTOR: Yes.
DAVROS: Then we have established one thing only.
DOCTOR: What?
DAVROS: You are not a good doctor.
DAVROS: Pity. I had hoped to see the sun one last time with the eyes of my true self.
MISSY: Oh, hello! Look at you all, with your nice, shiny domes. Oh, I am loving this.  You're my secret favourite. Don't tell the others.
DALEK SUPREME: You are an enemy of the Daleks.
MISSY: Yes, well, anyone who's not a Dalek is an enemy of the Daleks, so that was an easy guess.
DALEK SUPREME: You will be exterminated.
MISSY: Please, please do, because I have been on my feet all day.
MISSY: But before you get all exterminate-y, two things. One, I want to see Davros. Two, I have a lovely little gift for you all, if you take me to him right now.
DALEK SUPREME: We do not negotiate.
MISSY: Clara Oswald. I brought you complete control of the Doctor, gift-wrapped. Better. Canned.
DAVROS: It is beautiful, my world, is it not?
DOCTOR: How did you get it back?
DAVROS: The Daleks remade it. Like you, they have a strong concept of home.
DOCTOR: No, like you. Everything you are, they are.
DAVROS: Like both of us, perhaps. How far we have come to go home again.
DOCTOR: I'm trying to pep this up, but you've been going a long time. Every Dalek on Skaro isn't enough any more.
DAVROS: It is so good of you to help me.
DOCTOR: I'm not helping you. I'm helping a little boy I abandoned on a battlefield. I think I owe him a sunrise.
DOCTOR: Come on, chin up.
DOCTOR: Any minute now
DAVROS: I have always admired you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Here it comes.
DAVROS: I wish, just once, we had been on the same side.
DOCTOR: Look, the sun's coming up. We're on the same side now.
DAVROS: I regret I cannot open my eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, don't ever tell anyone that I did this.
DOCTOR: A little bit of regeneration energy. Probably cost me an arm or a leg somewhere down the line. Or I'll just be really little.
DOCTOR: Should be enough, just to
DAVROS: Hold him firm, Colony Sarff. He is precious to us now.
DOCTOR: What are you doing?
DAVROS: Regeneration energy. The ancient magic of the Time Lords. I thought I would have to tear you apart to take it from you but, as always, your compassion is your downfall.
DOCTOR: No! No! No, please! No!
DAVROS: You have opened your veins of your own free will, and all Daleks shall drink the blood of Gallifrey. They shall rise stronger than ever.
DALEK SUPREME: Where is Clara Oswald? You will tell us! You will tell us! You will tell us
MISSY: I'm sorry. Was I, er, was I boring you?
MISSY: No. No, no, no, no, Doctor. What have you done?
CLARA : What's happening?
CLARA DALEK: What is happening?
MISSY: I have to find the Doctor.
CLARA: No!
CLARA DALEK: Exterminate!
CLARA: No!
CLARA DALEK: Exterminate!
CLARA: Please, you can't just leave me here. Please!
DAVROS: There was a prophecy, Doctor, on your own world.
DOCTOR: Please you must, you must stop this. You must stop this!
DAVROS: It spoke of a hybrid creature. Two great warrior races forced together to create a warrior greater than either. Is that what you ran from, Doctor? Your part in the coming of the hybrid? Half Dalek, half Time Lord?
MISSY: Give me your gun!
DOCTOR: Stop!
DALEK SUPREME: We are renewed. We are more powerful. The experiment has succeeded. All praise Davros.
DALEKS: All praise Davros! All praise Davros! 
MISSY: Morning.
DOCTOR: Where's Clara?
MISSY: Oh, hello to you, too.
DOCTOR: You're alive, so she is too. Where is she?
MISSY: I'm fine, thanks for asking.
DAVROS: Oh, you are not fine. Thanks to you, Doctor, my creations shall grow to yet greater supremacy, and my own life is prolonged. This is the final defeat of the Time Lords. Have you nothing to say, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Three.
DAVROS: Do you understand what has happened? Hear my children sing.
DOCTOR: Two.
MISSY: Oh, I know that face.
DAVROS: All praise Davros, creator and saviour of the Daleks.
DOCTOR: One.
DAVROS: What is that? What's happening?
DALEK SUPREME: We are under attack. Explain! Explain!
DOCTOR: I knew exactly what you were doing, and I let you do it. You transmitted regeneration energy into every Dalek on this planet. Every single one.
DAVROS: What have you done?
DOCTOR: One word. Er, no, two words, actually. First word, moron.
DOCTOR: Second word, sewers.
DALEK: Emergency! What is happening? Power is fluctuating!
DAVROS: No. This cannot be correct. How can this be?
DOCTOR: Generations of Daleks just woke up very cross, and they are coming up the pipes. Or to put it another way, bye!
DAVROS: Doctor, you must help me.
MISSY: Can I just say, it's been an absolute pleasure to finally meet you?
MISSY: Doctor!
DALEK: My vision is impaired. I cannot see.
DALEK SUPREME:  Alert. I cannot control.
CLARA DALEK: Doctor!
DOCTOR: This city is about to be sucked into the ground. Your own sewer is about to consume you. There's no way you can win, there is nothing you can do, so just tell me, where is Clara Oswald?
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're a Dalek. Where is Clara?
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know that you're a Dalek. Where is Clara Oswald?
CLARA : It's me, I'm right here! It's me, I'm in here! It's Clara!
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek! I am a Dalek!
MISSY: Doctor, stop! It's you, isn't it? I mean, no offence, you all look alike, but it is it is you?
CLARA : Yes, it's me, it's me. I'm right here.
CLARA DALEK: Affirmative.
MISSY: Clara's dead, Doctor. This is the one that killed her.
CLARA DALEK: Do not listen to her. I am a Dalek, I am a Dalek.
MISSY: I got her out of the city, but this one caught us and shot her down. There was nothing I could do, I'm afraid.
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek.
MISSY: She ran. She screamed. I'm so glad you didn't have to see that.
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek. I am a Dalek.
MISSY: This one's a mad one, isn't it? I mean, it's almost like, like it's proud.
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek. I am a Dalek. I am a Dalek!
MISSY: Kill it, Doctor. They're all going to die anyway. Indulge yourself. Go on, kill the Dalek.
CLARA DALEK: Do not kill me! Do not kill me!
DOCTOR: Is Clara dead?
CLARA : No! Doctor, no! I'm not dead, I'm in here! Can you hear me?
CLARA DALEK: I am a Dalek. I am alive.
CLARA : I'm your friend. I'm your friend!
CLARA DALEK: I am your enemy. Your enemy.
CLARA : No, please, don't.
CLARA DALEK: Mercy. Mercy.
DOCTOR: You shouldn't be able to say that.
CLARA DALEK: Mercy.
DOCTOR: That word shouldn't exist in your vocabulary. How did Davros teach you to say that?
CLARA DALEK: Mercy.
DOCTOR: Why aren't you trying to kill me?
CLARA DALEK: Mercy.
CLARA : Because I would never kill you. You are the last person I would ever kill.
CLARA DALEK: I show mercy.
DOCTOR: I'm putting the gun down. Open your casing.
CLARA : How?
CLARA DALEK: How?
DOCTOR: Just think the word "open". It'll work.
MISSY: Oh, look at that. Now, there's a surprise.
DOCTOR: Missy, run.
CLARA: Oh, Doctor  
MISSY: In a way, this is why I gave her to you in the first place. To make you see. The friend inside the enemy, the enemy inside the friend.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Clara. I'm so sorry!
MISSY: Everyone's a bit of both. Everyone's a hybrid.
DOCTOR: I said, run.
MISSY: It wasn't me who ran, Doctor. That was always you.
DALEK SUPREME: Emergency! Dalek control is compromised.
DOCTOR: Where was the Tardis? It was over there somewhere, wasn't it?
DALEK SUPREME: What is happening? Explain! Explain!
DOCTOR: Dalek Supreme, your sewers are revolting.
DALEK SUPREME: You will assist, or you will be exterminated.
DOCTOR: Oh, well, go on, then. Exterminate away.
CLARA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Oops, sorry. Tardis force field is still here. We get in, you don't.
DALEK SUPREME: The Tardis has been destroyed.
DOCTOR: Ah, don't be silly, of course it hasn't. It just redistributed itself for a moment. Hostile Action Dispersal System. I'll give it a quick blast from my sonic, and the real time envelope will reassemble right here.
CLARA: Doctor, you don't have your screwdriver.
DOCTOR: Oh, yeah, I'm over screwdrivers. They spoil the line of your jacket. These days, I'm all about wearable technology.
CLARA: No! No? Seriously?
DALEK SUPREME: What is happening?
DOCTOR: Oh, same old, same old. Just the Doctor and Clara Oswald in the Tardis.
DALEKS: Humanoid detected. Humanoid detected. Remain still. Do not move. Do not move. You are a Time Lord.
MISSY: You know what? I've just had a very clever idea.
CLARA: No chance you're going to tell me what's in that confession dial, I suppose?
CLARA: Hmm.
DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense.
CLARA: What doesn't?
DOCTOR: When you were in the Dalek, you made it say mercy.. It shouldn't have understood the concept, it shouldn't have been able to say it. How did a tiny piece of mercy get into the DNA of the Daleks?
CLARA: Doctor?
YOUNG DAVROS: Help me! You can't leave me, you promised. You said I had a chance.
YOUNG DAVROS: Who are you? I don't get it. How did you get there?
DOCTOR: From the future.
YOUNG DAVROS: Are you going to save me?
DOCTOR: I'm going to save my friend the only way I can. Exterminate!
DOCTOR: Come on, I'll take you home.
YOUNG DAVROS: Which side are you on? Are you the enemy?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure that any of that matters, friends, enemies. So long as there's mercy. Always mercy.
