Rose
ROSE: Bye!
JACKIE: See you later!
TANNOY: This is a customer announcement. The store will be closing in five minutes. Thank you.
GUARD: Oi!
ROSE: Wilson? Wilson, I've got the lottery money. Wilson, are you there?
ROSE: I can't hang about 'cos they're closing the shop. Wilson! Oh, come on.
ROSE: Hello? Hello, Wilson, it's Rose. Hello? Wilson?
ROSE: Wilson? Wilson!
 
ROSE: You're kidding me.
ROSE: Is that someone mucking about? Who is it?
ROSE: Yeah, you got me. Very funny.
 
ROSE: Right, I've got the joke. Who's idea was this? Is it Derek's? Is it? Derek, is this you?
DOCTOR: Run.
ROSE: You pulled his arm off.
DOCTOR: Yep. Plastic.
ROSE: Very clever. Nice trick! Who were they then, students? Is this a student thing or what?
DOCTOR: Why would they be students?
ROSE: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Well, you said it. Why students?
ROSE: 'Cos to get that many people dressed up and being silly, they got to be students.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Well done.
ROSE: Thanks.
DOCTOR: They're not students.
ROSE: Whoever they are, when Wilson finds them, he's going to call the police.
DOCTOR: Who's Wilson?
ROSE: Chief electrician.
DOCTOR: Wilson's dead.
ROSE: That's just not funny. That's sick!
DOCTOR: Hold on. Mind your eyes.
ROSE: I've had enough of this now.
ROSE: Who are you, then? Who's that lot down there? I said, who are they?
DOCTOR: They're made of plastic. Living plastic creatures. They're being controlled by a relay device in the roof, which would be a great big problem if I didn't have this.  So, I'm going to go up there and blow them up, and I might well die in the process, but don't worry about me. No, you go home. Go on. Go and have your lovely beans on toast. Don't tell anyone about this, because if you do, you'll get them killed.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, by the way. What's your name?
ROSE: Rose.
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you, Rose. Run for your life!
TAXI DRIVER: Watch it!
 
TELEVISION: The whole of Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire. Early reports indicate
JACKIE: I know. It's on the telly. It's everywhere. She's lucky to be alive. Honestly, it's aged her. Skin like an old bible. Walking in now you'd think I was her daughter. Oh, and here's himself.
MICKEY: I've been phoning your mobile. You could've been dead. It's on the news and everything. I can't believe that your shop went up!
ROSE: I'm all right, honestly, I'm fine! Don't make a fuss.
MICKEY: Well, what happened?
ROSE: I don't know!
MICKEY: What was it though? What caused it?
ROSE: I wasn't in the shop. I was outside. I didn't see anything.
JACKIE: It's Debbie on the end. She knows a man on the Mirror. Five hundred quid for an interview.
ROSE: Oh that's brilliant! Give it here.
JACKIE: Well, you've got to find some way of making money. Your job's kaput and I'm not bailing you out.
JACKIE: Bev! She's alive. I've told her, sue for compensation. She was within seconds of death.
MICKEY: What're you drinking, tea? Nah, nah, that's no good, that's no good. You're in shock. You need something stronger.
ROSE: I'm all right.
MICKEY: Now, come on, you deserve a proper drink. We're going down the pub, you and me. My treat. How about it?
ROSE: Is there a match on?
MICKEY: No, I'm just thinking about you, babe.
ROSE: There's a match on, ain't there.
MICKEY: That's not the point, but we could catch the last five minutes.
ROSE: Go on, then. I'm fine, really. Go. Get rid of that.
MICKEY: Bye, bye.
ROSE: Bye.
TELEVISION: Fire then spread throughout the store. Fifteen fire crews are in attendance though it's thought there is very little chance of saving the infrastructure.
JACKIE : There's no point in getting up, sweetheart. You've got no job to go to.
JACKIE: There's Finch's. You could try them. They've always got jobs.
ROSE: Oh, great. The butchers.
JACKIE: Well, it might do you good. That shop was giving you airs and graces. And I'm not joking about compensation. You've had genuine shock and trauma. Arianna got two thousand quid off the council just because the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek! I know she is Greek, but that's not the point. It was a valid claim.
ROSE: Mum, you're such a liar. I told you to nail that cat flap down. We're going to get strays.
JACKIE: I did it weeks back!
ROSE: No, you thought about it.
DOCTOR: What're you doing here?
ROSE: I live here.
DOCTOR: Well, what do you do that for?
ROSE: Because I do. I'm only at home because someone blew up my job.
DOCTOR: I must have got the wrong signal. You're not plastic, are you? No, bonehead. Bye, then.
ROSE: You. Inside. Right now.
JACKIE : Who is it?
ROSE: It's about last night. He's part of the inquiry. Give us ten minutes.
JACKIE: She deserves compensation.
DOCTOR: Oh, we're talking millions.
JACKIE: I'm in my dressing gown.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are.
JACKIE: There's a strange man in my bedroom.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is.
JACKIE: Well, anything could happen.
DOCTOR: No.
ROSE: Don't mind the mess. Do you want a coffee?
DOCTOR: Might as well, thanks. Just milk.
ROSE: We should go to the police. Seriously. Both of us.
DOCTOR: That won't last, he's gay and she's an alien.
ROSE: I'm not blaming you, even if it was just some sort of joke that went wrong.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Sad ending.
ROSE: They said on the news they'd found a body.
DOCTOR: Rose Tyler.
DOCTOR: Ah, could've been worse. Look at the ears.
ROSE: All the same, he was nice. Nice bloke.
ROSE: I want you to explain everything.
DOCTOR: Maybe not.
DOCTOR: What's that, then? You got a cat?
ROSE: No.
ROSE: We did have, but now they're just strays. They come in off the estate.
ROSE: I told Mickey to chuck that out. You're all the same. Give a man a plastic hand. Anyway, I don't even know your name. Doctor, what was it?
DOCTOR: It's all right, I've stopped it. There you go, you see? Armless.
ROSE: Do you think?
DOCTOR: Ow!
ROSE: Hold on a minute. You can't just go swanning off.
DOCTOR: Yes I can. Here I am. This is me, swanning off. See you.
ROSE: But that arm was moving. It tried to kill me.
DOCTOR: Ten out of ten for observation.
ROSE: You can't just walk away. That's not fair. You've got to tell me what's going on.
DOCTOR: No, I don't.
ROSE: All right, then. I'll go to the police. I'll tell everyone. You said, if I did that, I'd get people killed. So, your choice. Tell me, or I'll start talking.
DOCTOR: Is that supposed to sound tough?
ROSE: Sort of.
DOCTOR: Doesn't work.
ROSE: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Told you. The Doctor.
ROSE: Yeah, but Doctor what?
DOCTOR: Just the Doctor.
ROSE: The Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hello!
ROSE: Is that supposed to sound impressive?
DOCTOR: Sort of.
ROSE: Come on, then. You can tell me. I've seen enough. Are you the police?
DOCTOR: No, I was just passing through. I'm a long way from home.
ROSE: But what have I done wrong? How comes those plastic things keep coming after me?
DOCTOR: Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you. You were just an accident. You got in the way, that's all.
ROSE: It tried to kill me.
DOCTOR: It was after me, not you. Last night, in the shop, I was there, you blundered in, almost ruined the whole thing. This morning, I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down. The only reason it fixed on you is 'cos you've met me.
ROSE: So what you're saying is, the entire world revolves around you.
DOCTOR: Sort of, yeah.
ROSE: You're full of it.
DOCTOR: Sort of, yeah.
ROSE: But, all this plastic stuff. Who else knows about it?
DOCTOR: No one.
ROSE: What, you're on your own?
DOCTOR: Well, who else is there? I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed, and watch telly, while all the time, underneath you, there's a war going on.
ROSE: Okay. Start from the beginning. I mean, if we're going to go with the living plastic, and I don't even believe that, but if we do, how did you kill it?
DOCTOR: The thing controlling it projects life into the arm. I cut off the signal, dead.
ROSE: So that's radio control?
DOCTOR: Thought control. Are you all right?
ROSE: Yeah. So, who's controlling it, then?
DOCTOR: Long story.
ROSE: But what's it all for? I mean, shop window dummies, what's that about? Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
DOCTOR: No.
ROSE: No.
DOCTOR: It's not a price war. They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you. Do you believe me?
ROSE: No.
DOCTOR: But you're still listening.
ROSE: Really, though, Doctor. Tell me, who are you?
DOCTOR: Do you know like we were saying about the Earth revolving? It's like when you were a kid. The first time they tell you the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it because everything looks like it's standing still. I can feel it. The turn of the Earth. The ground beneath our feet is spinning at a thousand miles an hour, and the entire planet is hurtling round the sun at sixty seven thousand miles an hour, and I can feel it. We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go. That's who I am. Now, forget me, Rose Tyler. Go home.
MICKEY: Hey, hey, here's my woman. Kit off!
ROSE: Shut up.
MICKEY: Coffee?
ROSE: Yeah, only if you wash the mug. And I don't mean rinse, I mean wash. Can I use your computer?
MICKEY: Yeah. Any excuse to get in the bedroom. Don't read my emails!
ROSE: You're not coming in. He's safe. He's got a wife and kids.
MICKEY: Yeah, who told you that? He did. That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
ROSE: Hello, I've come to see Clive? We've been emailing.
BOY: Dad! It's one of your nutters!
CLIVE: Oh, sorry. Hello. You must be Rose. I'm Clive, obviously.
ROSE: I'd better tell you now. My boyfriend's waiting in the car, just in case you're going to kill me.
CLIVE: No, good point. No murders.
CAROLINE : Who is it?
CLIVE: Oh, it's something to do with the Doctor. She's been reading the website. Please, come through. I'm in the shed.
CAROLINE: She? She's read a website about the Doctor? She's a she?
CLIVE: A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive. I couldn't just send it to you. People might intercept it, if you know what I mean. If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place. Political diaries, conspirisy theories, even ghost stories. No first name, no last name, just the Doctor. Always The Doctor. And the title seems to have been passed down from father to son. It appears to be an inheritance. That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
ROSE: Yeah.
CLIVE: I tracked it down to the Washington public archive just last year. The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original
CLIVE: November the 22nd, 1963. The assassination of President Kennedy. You see?
ROSE: It must be his father.
CLIVE: Going further back. April 1912. This is a photo of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend. This was taken the day before they were due to sail off for the New World on the Titanic, and for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived. And here we are. 1883. Another Doctor.  And look, the same lineage. It's identical. This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra on the very day Krakatoa exploded. The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history. When disaster comes, he's there. He brings the storm in his wake and he has one constant companion.
ROSE: Who's that?
CLIVE: Death.
CLIVE: If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, then one thing's for certain. We're all in danger.
MICKEY: Come on, then.
CLIVE: If he's singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls, then God help you.
ROSE: But who is he? Who do you think he is?
CLIVE: I think he's the same man. I think he's immortal. I think he's an alien from another world.
ROSE: All right, he's a nutter. Off his head. Complete online conspiracy freak. You win! What are we going to do tonight? I fancy a pizza.
MICKEY: Pizza! P-p-p-pizza!
ROSE: Or Chinese.
MICKEY: Pizza!
ROSE: Do you think I should try the hospital? Suki said they had ajobs going in the canteen. Is that it then, dishing out chips. I could do A Levels. I don't know. It's all Jimmy Stone's fault. I only left school because of him. Look where he ended up. What do you think?
MICKEY: So, where did you meet this Doctor?
ROSE: I'm sorry, wasn't I talking about me for a second?
MICKEY: Because I reckon it started back at the shop, am I right? Was he something to do with that?
ROSE: No.
MICKEY: Come on.
ROSE: Sort of.
MICKEY: What was he doing there?
ROSE: I'm not going on about it, Mickey. Really, I'm not, because, I know it sounds daft, but I don't think it's safe. I think he's dangerous.
MICKEY: But you can trust me, sweetheart. Babe,  sugar, babe, sugar. You can tell me anything. Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning, and I can help you, Rose. Because that's all I really want to do, sweetheart, babe, babe, sugar, sweetheart.
ROSE: What're you doing that for?
WAITER: Your champagne.
MICKEY: We didn't order any champagne. Where's the Doctor?
WAITER: Madam, your champagne.
ROSE: It's not ours. Mickey, what is it? What's wrong?
MICKEY: I need to find out how much you know, so where is he?
WAITER: Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
MICKEY: Look, we didn't order it.
MICKEY: Ah. Gotcha.
DOCTOR: Don't mind me. I'm just toasting the happy couple. On the house!
MICKEY: Anyway.
MICKEY: Don't think that's going to stop me.
ROSE: Everyone out! Out now! Get out! Get out! Get out!
ROSE: Open the gate! Use that tube thing. Come on!
DOCTOR: Sonic screwdriver.
ROSE: Use it!
DOCTOR: Nah. Tell you what, let's go in here.
ROSE: You can't hide inside a wooden box. It's going to get us! Doctor!
ROSE: It's going to follow us!
DOCTOR: The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door, and believe me, they've tried. Now, shut up a minute.
DOCTOR: You see, the arm was too simple, but the head's perfect. I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source. Right. Where do you want to start?
ROSE: Er, the inside's bigger than the outside?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROSE: It's alien.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
ROSE: Are you alien?
DOCTOR: Yes. Is that all right?
ROSE: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's called the Tardis, this thing. T A R D I S. That's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
DOCTOR: That's okay. Culture shock. Happens to the best of us.
ROSE: Did they kill him? Mickey? Did they kill Mickey? Is he dead?
DOCTOR: Oh. I didn't think of that.
ROSE: He's my boyfriend. You pulled off his head. They copied him and you didn't even think? And now you're just going to let him melt?
DOCTOR: Melt?
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
ROSE: What're you doing?
DOCTOR: Following the signal. It's fading. Wait a minute, I've got it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Almost there. Almost there. Here we go!
ROSE: You can't go out there. It's not safe.
DOCTOR: I lost the signal, I got so close.
ROSE: We've moved. Does it fly?
DOCTOR: Disappears there and reappears here. You wouldn't understand.
ROSE: If we're somewhere else, what about that headless thing? It's still on the loose.
DOCTOR: It melted with the head. Are you going to witter on all night?
ROSE: I'll have to tell his mother. Mickey. I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him, again! You were right, you are alien.
DOCTOR: Look, if I did forget some kid called Mickey
ROSE: Yeah, he's not a kid.
DOCTOR: It's because I'm trying to save the life of every stupid ape blundering on top of this planet, all right?
ROSE: All right.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is!
ROSE: If you are an alien, how comes you sound like you're from the North?
DOCTOR: Lots of planets have a north.
ROSE: What's a police public call box?
DOCTOR: It's a telephone box from the 1950s. It's a disguise.
ROSE: Okay. And this, this living plastic. What's it got against us?
DOCTOR: Nothing. It loves you. You've got such a good planet. Lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins in the air, perfect. Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs. It's food stock was destroyed in the war, all its protein plants rotted, so Earth, dinner!
ROSE: Any way of stopping it?
DOCTOR: Anti-plastic.
ROSE: Anti-plastic.
DOCTOR: Anti-plastic. But first I've got to find it. How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
ROSE: Hold on. Hide what?
DOCTOR: The transmitter. The Consciousness is controlling every single piece of plastic, so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal.
ROSE: What's it look like?
DOCTOR: Like a transmitter. Round and massive, slap bang in the middle of London.
DOCTOR: A huge circular metal structure like a dish, like a wheel. Radial. Close to where we're standing. Must be completely invisible. What? What?
DOCTOR: What? What is it? What?
DOCTOR: Oh. Fantastic!
DOCTOR: Think of it, plastic all over the world, every artificial thing waiting to come alive. The shop window dummies, the phones, the wires, the cables
ROSE: The breast implants.
DOCTOR: Still, we've found the transmitter. The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
ROSE: What about down here?
DOCTOR: Looks good to me.
DOCTOR: The Nestene Consciousness. That's it, inside the vat. A living plastic creature.
ROSE: Well, then. Tip in your anti-plastic and let's go.
DOCTOR: I'm not here to kill it. I've got to give it a chance.
DOCTOR: I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
DOCTOR: Thank you. If I might have permission to approach?
ROSE: Oh, God! Mickey, it's me! It's okay. It's all right.
MICKEY: That thing down there, the liquid. Rose, it can talk!
ROSE: You're stinking. Doctor, they kept him alive.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that was always a possibility. Keep him alive to maintain the copy.
ROSE: You knew that and you never said?
DOCTOR: Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you?
DOCTOR: Am I addressing the Consciousness? Thank you. If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp shunt technology. So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that you shunt off?
DOCTOR: Oh, don't give me that. It's an invasion, plain and simple. Don't talk about constitutional rights. I am talking! This planet is just starting. These stupid little people have only just learnt how to walk, but they're capable of so much more. I'm asking you on their behalf. Please, just go.
ROSE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: That was just insurance. I wasn't going to use it. I was not attacking you. I'm here to help. I'm not your enemy. I swear, I'm not. What do you mean?
DOCTOR: No. Oh, no. Honestly, no. Yes, that's my ship. That's not true. I should know, I was there. I fought in the war. It wasn't my fault. I couldn't save your world! I couldn't save any of them!
ROSE: What's it doing?!
DOCTOR: It's the Tardis! The Nestene's identified its superior technology. It's terrified. It's going to the final phase. It's starting the invasion! Get out, Rose! Just leg it now!
ROSE: Mum?
JACKIE: Oh, there you are. I was just going to phone. You can get compensation. I said so. I've got this document thing off the police. Don't thank me.
ROSE: Where are you, mum?
JACKIE: I'm in town.
ROSE: No, go home! Just go home right now!
JACKIE: Darling, you're breaking up. Listen, I'm just going to do a bit of late night shopping. I'll see you later. Ta-ra!
ROSE: Mum! Mum!
DOCTOR: It's the activation signal. It's transmitting!
ROSE: It's the end of the world.
CLIVE: There's no point creating a spreadsheet if you're going to spend summer money in winter months.
CAROLINE: Oh, my God! I thought they were dummies. I nearly had a heart-attack.
CLIVE: It's true. Everything I read, all the stories. It's all true.
DOCTOR: Get out, Rose! Just get out! Run!
ROSE: The stairs have gone.
ROSE: I haven't got the key!
MICKEY: We're going to die!
DOCTOR: No!
NESTENE: Time Lord.
MICKEY: Just leave him! There's nothing you can do!
ROSE: I've got no A Levels, no job, no future.
ROSE: But I tell you what I have got. Jericho Street Junior School under 7s gymnastic team. I've got the bronze!
DOCTOR: Rose!
DOCTOR: Now we're in trouble.
JACKIE: Rose, Rose, don't go out of the house.
JACKIE : It's not safe. There were these things, and they were shooting! And they
JACKIE: Hello? Hello?
ROSE: A fat lot of good you were.
DOCTOR: Nestene Consciousness? Easy.
ROSE: You were useless in there. You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I would. Thank you. Right then, I'll be off, unless, er, I don't know, you could come with me. This box isn't just a London hopper, you know. It goes anywhere in the universe free of charge.
MICKEY: Don't. He's an alien. He's a thing.
DOCTOR: He's not invited. What do you think? You could stay here, fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go anywhere.
ROSE: Is it always this dangerous?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
ROSE: Yeah, I can't. I've er, I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump, so.
DOCTOR: Okay. See you around.
ROSE: Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on.
DOCTOR: By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
ROSE: Thanks.
MICKEY: Thanks for what?
ROSE: Exactly.
