The Vampires of Venice
GUIDO: Signora, your school offers a chance for betterment, escape. My daughter. Isabella is seventeen now, but what prospects are there for the daughter of a boat builder? There's no future for us. No future but you.
ROSANNA: I am moved by your concern for your daughter. I believe protecting the future of one's own is a sacred duty.
GUIDO: Signora, she is my world.
ROSANNA: Then we will take your world.
GUIDO: I knew it.
ROSANNA: Say goodbye to your daughter.
GUIDO: Now, signora?
ROSANNA: Why wait? Time ticks.
GUIDO: Be brave, my girl. Make me proud.
ROSANNA: Step into the light, my dear. That's it.
ROSANNA: What say you, Francesco? Do you like her?
FRANCESCO: Oh, I do, Mother. I do.
RORY: Hey! It's me. Hello. How are you?
RORY : The reason for this call is because I haven't told you for seven hours that I love you, which is a scandal, and even if we weren't getting married tomorrow, I'd ask you to marry me anyway.
RORY: Yes, I would, because you are smashing.
RORY: Oh. Oh. Oh, blimey. I've. I've, er got to go. I'll see you tomorrow.
ALL: Out. Out. Out.
DOCTOR: Rory! That's a relief. I thought I'd burst out of the wrong cake, again. That reminds me, there's a girl standing outside in a bikini. Could someone let her in and give her a jumper? Lucy? Lovely girl. Diabetic. Now then, Rory. We need to talk about your fianc�e. She tried to kiss me. Tell you what, though. You're a lucky man. She's a great kisser.
DOCTOR: Funny how you can say something in your head and it sounds fine.
DOCTOR: Oh, the life out there, it dazzles. I mean, it blinds you to the things that are important. I've seen it devour relationships and plans. It's meant to do that. Because for one person to have seen all that, to taste the glory and then go back, it will tear you apart. So, I'm sending you somewhere, together.
AMY: Whoa. What, like a date?
DOCTOR: Anywhere you want. Any time you want. One condition. It has to be amazing. The Moulin Rouge in 1890. The first Olympic Games. Think of it as a wedding present, because it's either this or tokens. It's a lot to take in, isn't it? Tiny box, huge room inside. What's that about? Let me explain.
RORY: It's another dimension.
DOCTOR: It's basically another dimension. What?
RORY: After what happened with Prisoner Zero, I've been reading up on all the latest scientific theories. FTL travel, parallel universes.
DOCTOR: I like the bit when someone says it's bigger on the inside. I always look forward to that.
AMY: So, this date. I'm kind of done with running down corridors. What do you think, Rory?
DOCTOR: How about somewhere romantic?
DOCTOR: Venice.
DOCTOR: Venezia. La Serenissima. Impossible city. Preposterous city. Founded by refugees running from Attila the Hun. It was just a collection of little wooden huts in the middle of the marsh, but became one of the most powerful cities in the world. Constantly being invaded, constantly flooding, constantly just beautiful. Ah, you got to love Venice. So many people did. Byron, Napoleon, Casanova. Ooo, that reminds me. 1580. That's all right. Casanova doesn't get born for a hundred and forty five years. Don't want to run into him. I owe him a chicken.
RORY: You owe Casanova a chicken?
DOCTOR: Long story. We had a bet.
INSPECTOR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Papers, if you please. Proof of residency, current bill of medical inspection.
DOCTOR: There you go, fellow. All to your satisfaction, I think you'll find.
INSPECTOR: I am so sorry, Your Holiness. I didn't realise.
DOCTOR: No worries. You were just doing your job. Sorry, what exactly is your job?
INSPECTOR: Checking for aliens. Visitors from foreign lands what might bring the plague with them.
AMY; Oh, that's nice. See where you bring me? The plague.
INSPECTOR: Don't worry, Viscountess. No, we're under quarantine here. No one comes in, no one goes out, and all because of the grace and wisdom of our patron, Signora Rosanna Calvierri.
DOCTOR: How interesting. I heard the plague died out years ago.
INSPECTOR: Not out there. No, Signora Calvierri has seen it with her own eyes. Streets are piled high with bodies, she said.
DOCTOR: Did she now.
INSPECTOR: Oi.
RORY: Er, according to this, I am your eunuch.
AMY: Oh yeah. I'll explain later.
 The Calvierri girls.
WOMAN: What do you want?
GUIDO: Where's my Isabella?
WOMAN: What are you doing? Get away from there.
GUIDO: Isabella? Isabella, it's me.
WOMAN: Girls, come along.
FRANCESCO: She's gone.
GUIDO: Isabella! It's me!
AMY: What was that about?
GUIDO: Isabella!
AMY: I hate it when he does that.
DOCTOR: Who are those girls?
GUIDO: I thought everyone knew about the Calvierri school.
DOCTOR: My first day here. It's okay. Parents do all sorts of things to get their children into good schools. They move house, they change religion. So why are you trying to get her out?
GUIDO: Something happens in there. Something magical, something evil. My own daughter didn't recognise me. And the girl who pushed me away, her face, like an animal.
DOCTOR: I think it's time I met this Signora Calvierri.
FRANCESCO: Mother?
ROSANNA: Mummy's hydrating, Francesco.
FRANCESCO: And we never interrupt Mummy when she's hydrating.
FRANCESCO: We were accosted again. A man made a grab for one of the girls. The longer we wait, the greater the risk of discovery. I mean, we've already converted more than enough. Surely it's time to introduce them to my brothers?
ROSANNA: I shall decide when we have enough.
FRANCESCO: If it's more you want, let me take the girls into the city tonight. We could
ROSANNA: We follow the plan. Let them hammer on our door. Beg to be taken.
RORY: And what have you been doing?
AMY: Well, running, and fighting. I've been scared. More scared than I thought was
RORY: Did you miss me?
AMY: I knew I'd be coming back.
RORY: He was right. It blots out everything else.
AMY: Rory, this is our date. Let's not do this. Not now.
RORY: Huh. We are in Venice and it is 1580.
AMY: I know.
FLOWER GIRL: Flowers, signor?
RORY: What was that?
RORY: She'll be okay. Where are you? Amy, come back!
GUIDO: You have my daughter. Isabella!
GUARD: No, you're not coming in. Just stop there. Look, we've told you.
GUIDO: You have my daughter. Isabella! I demand you let me see my daughter.
GUARD: Go away.
GUIDO: Isabella, it's me. It's your father.
GUARD: We will arrest you.
GUIDO: Isabella!
GUARD: Give it up, will you. Move off.
DOCTOR: Hello, handsome.
VAMPIRES: Who are you?
DOCTOR: How are you doing that? I am loving it. You're like Houdini, only five slightly scary girls, and he was shorter. Will be shorter. I'm rambling.
VAMPIRES: I'll ask you again, signor. Who are you?
DOCTOR: Why don't you check this out?
DOCTOR: Library card. Of course, it's with. He's. I need a spare. Pale, creepy girls who don't like sunlight and can't be seen. Ha. Am I thinking what I think I'm thinking? But the city. Why shut down the city? Unless
VAMPIRES: Leave now, signor, or we shall call for the Steward, if you are lucky.
DOCTOR: Ooo.
DOCTOR: Tell me the whole plan.  One day that will work. Listen, I would love to stay here. This whole thing. I'm thrilled. Oh, this is Christmas.
AMY: Doctor!
DOCTOR: I just met some vampires.
AMY: We just saw a vampire.
DOCTOR: And creepy girls and everything.
AMY: Vampires.
RORY: We think we just saw a vampire.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. Amy was just telling me.
AMY: Yeah, yeah. The Doctor actually went to their house.
RORY: Oh. Right. Well.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, first we need to get back in there somehow.
RORY: What?
AMY: How do we do that?
RORY: Back in where?
DOCTOR: Come and meet my new friend.
GUIDO: As you saw, there's no clear way in. The House of Calvierri is like a fortress. But there's a tunnel underneath it, with a ladder and shaft that leads up into the house. I tried to get in once myself, but I hit a trapdoor.
AMY: You need someone on the inside.
DOCTOR: No.
AMY: You don't even know what I was going to say.
DOCTOR: Er, that we pretend you're an applicant for the school to get you inside, and tonight you come down and open the trapdoor to let us in.
AMY: Oh. So you do know what I was going to say.
RORY: Are you insane?
AMY: We don't have another option.
RORY: He said no, Amy. Listen to him.
GUIDO: There is another option.
GUIDO: I work at the Arsenale. We build the warships for the navy.
DOCTOR: Gunpowder. Most people just nick stationery from where they work. Look, I have a thing about guns and huge quantities of explosive.
GUIDO: What do you suggest, then? We wait until they turn her into an animal?
AMY: I'll be there three, four hours, tops.
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It can't keep happening like this. This is how they go. But I have to know. We go together, say you're my daughter.
RORY: What? Don't listen to him.
AMY: Your daughter? You look about nine.
DOCTOR: Brother, then.
AMY: Too weird. Fianc�.
RORY: I'm not having him run around telling people he's your fianc�.
AMY: No. No, you're right.
RORY: Thank you.
AMY: I mean, they've already seen the Doctor. You should do it.
RORY: Me?
AMY: Yeah. You can be my brother.
RORY: Why is him being your brother weird, but with me, it's okay?
RORY: Actually, I thought you were her fianc�.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's not helping.
RORY: This whole thing is mental. They're vampires, for God's sake.
DOCTOR: We hope.
AMY: So if they're not vampires?
DOCTOR: Makes you wonder what could be so bad it doesn't actually mind us thinking it's a vampire.
RORY: So, basically, both of our parents are dead from getting the plague. I'm a gondola driver, so money's a bit tight, so having my sister go to your school for special people would be brilliant. Cheers.
FRANCESCO: Have we met?
RORY: I've just got one of those faces.
FRANCESCO: I wasn't talking to you.
RORY: She's got the same face, which is because she's my sister.
ROSANNA: Carlo, explain yourself. Why have you brought me this imbecile?
CARLO: Signora, they have references from His Majesty the King of Sweden.
ROSANNA: What? Let me see.
ROSANNA: Well, now I see what got my Steward so excited. What say you, Francesco? Do you like her?
FRANCESCO: Oh, I do, Mother. I do.
ROSANNA: Then we would be delighted to accept her. Say goodbye to your sister.
AMY: Tell Uncle Doctor I'll see you both really soon, okay? I'll be fine.
RORY: Amy.
CARLO: There are clothes on the bed. Get changed and wait here.
AMY: Blimey. This is private education, then?
AMY: Hey. Hello, I'm Amy. What's your name?
ISABELLA: Isabella.
AMY: Listen, we're going to get you out of here, but I need you to tell me what's going on. What is this place? What are they doing?
ISABELLA: They er, they come at night. They gather around my bed, and they take me to a room with this green light and a chair with straps, as if for a surgeon.
AMY: What happens in there?
ISABELLA: I wake up here. And the sunlight burns my skin like candle wax.
DOCTOR: She'll be fine.
RORY: You can promise me that, can you?
GUIDO: We're here.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, I'll go first. If anything happens to me, go back
RORY: What happened, between you and Amy? You said she kissed you.
DOCTOR: Now? You want to do this now?
RORY: I have a right to know. I'm getting married in four hundred and thirty years.
DOCTOR: She was frightened. I was frightened. But we survived, you know, and the relief of it, and so she kissed me.
RORY: And you kissed her back.
DOCTOR: No. I kissed her mouth.
RORY: Funny.
DOCTOR: Rory. Rory, she kissed me because I was there. It would have been you. It should have been you.
RORY: Yeah, it should have been me.
DOCTOR: Exactly. That's why I brought you here.
DOCTOR: Can we go and see the vampires now, please?
CARLO: Control yourself, child.
AMY: Take your hands off me!
ROSANNA: Psychic paper. Did you really think that would work on me?
DOCTOR: Push. Come on. There we are. Amy. Where's Amy? Amy?
RORY: I can't see a thing. Just as well I brought this, then.
DOCTOR: Ultraviolet. Portable sunlight.
RORY: Yours is bigger than mine.
DOCTOR: Let's not go there.
ROSANNA: Where are you from? Did you fall through the Chasm?
FRANCESCO: Mother this is pointless. Let's just start the process and
ROSANNA: Hold your tongue, Francesco. I need to know what this girl is doing in a world of savages with psychic paper. Who are you with? You see, I scarcely believe your idiot brother sent you. What are you doing in my school?
The chair is brought forward, and a drip bag is hung from a hook above it.)
AMY: Okay, I'll tell you. I'm from Ofsted.
ROSANNA:  Put her in the chair.
AMY: No! Take your hands off me!
ROSANNA: Oh, make sport of me, will you? Tease me as if I were your dog? Well, this dog has a bite, girl.
AMY: Doctor!
RORY: If we cancel now, we lose the deposit on the village hall. The salsa band. Oh.
RORY: What happened to them?
DOCTOR: They've had all the moisture taken out of them.
FRANCESCO: Mother, where you drink from her, may we share? I'm so thirsty.
ROSANNA: Of course, darling.
RORY: That's what vampires do, right? They drink your blood and replace it with their own.
DOCTOR: Yeah, except these people haven't just had their blood taken, but all the water in their entire bodies.
RORY: Why did they die? Why aren't they like the girls in the school?
DOCTOR: Maybe not everyone survives the process.
RORY: You know what's dangerous about you? It's not that you make people take risks, it's that you make them want to impress you. You make it so they don't want to let you down. You have no idea how dangerous you make people to themselves when you're around.
VAMPIRES: Who are you?
DOCTOR: We should run. Run.
ROSANNA: This is how it works. First, we drink you until you're dry. Then we fill you with our blood. It rages through you like a fire, changing you, until one morning you awake and your humanity is a dream now faded.
FRANCESCO: Or you die. That can happen.
AMY: And if I survive?
ROSANNA: Then there are ten thousand husbands waiting for you in the water.
AMY: Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of engaged.
DOCTOR : Oh! Rory, come on.
DOCTOR: Cab for Amy Pond?
ROSANNA: This rescue plan. Not exactly watertight, is it?
DOCTOR: Ah ha!
AMY: Rory.
RORY: Amy.
ISABELLA: Quickly, through here.
ROSANNA: Seal the house.
AMY: They're not vampires.
DOCTOR: What?
AMY: I saw them. I saw her. They're not vampires, they're aliens.
DOCTOR: Classic.
RORY: That's good news? What is wrong with you people?
DOCTOR: Come on, Rory. Move.
DOCTOR: Keep moving. Come on, guys.
ISABELLA: Quickly, quickly. Get out. Quick. Quick.
DOCTOR: Come on. Run.
ISABELLA: I can't.
AMY: Is he dead?
RORY: No, he's breathing.
CARLO: And so in memory of the children lost to the Silence, the traitor is delivered to the arms of those she betrayed.
ISABELLA: Do you expect me to drown? I'm Venetian. I can swim. We can all swim.
ISABELLA: Something touched my leg! They're all around me. They bite!
ROSANNA: Now leave us.
FRANCESCO: Mother, change your form, or my brothers will think they are being fed twice today.
ROSANNA: Not long now. It's not long.
DOCTOR: Long way from Saturnyne, aren't you, Sister of the Water?
ROSANNA: No, let me guess. The owner of the psychic paper. Then I take it you're a refugee, like me?
DOCTOR: I'll make you a deal. An answer for an answer. You're using a perception filter. It doesn't change your features, but manipulates the brainwaves of the person looking at you. But seeing one of you for the first time in, say, a mirror, the brain doesn't know what to fill the gap with, so leaves it blank, hence no reflection.
ROSANNA: Your question?
DOCTOR: Why can we see your big teeth?
ROSANNA: Self preservation over rides the mirage. The subconscious perceives the threat and tries to alert the conscious brain.
DOCTOR: Where's Isabella?
ROSANNA: My turn. Where are you from?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey.
ROSANNA: You should be in a museum. Or in a mausoleum.
DOCTOR: Why are you here?
ROSANNA: We ran from the Silence. Why are you here?
DOCTOR: Wedding present. The Silence?
ROSANNA: There were cracks. Some were tiny. Some were as big as the sky. Through some we saw worlds and people, and through others we saw Silence and the end of all things. We fled to an ocean like ours, and the crack snapped shut behind us. Saturnyne was lost.
DOCTOR: So Earth is to become Saturnyne Mark Two?
ROSANNA: And you can help me. We can build a new society here, as others have. What do you say?
DOCTOR: Where's Isabella?
ROSANNA: Isabella?
DOCTOR: The girl who saved my friend.
ROSANNA: Oh, deserters must be executed. Any general will tell you that. I need an answer, Doctor. A partnership. Any which way you choose.
DOCTOR: I don't think that's such a good idea, do you? I'm a Time Lord. You're a big fish. Think of the children.
ROSANNA: Carlo? You're right. We're nothing alike. I will bend the heavens to save my race, while you philosophise.
DOCTOR: This ends today. I will tear down the House of Calvierri, stone by stone. Take your hands off me, Carlo. And you know why? You didn't know Isabella's name. You didn't know Isabella's name.
CARLO : Open the gates.
ROSANNA: Attend. Attend. The storm is coming.
ROSANNA: Argh!
FRANCESCO: Mummy, what's wrong with your perception filter?
ROSANNA: The idiot child must have damaged it when she kicked me.
ROSANNA: Now, assemble the girls. I have a job for them.
DOCTOR: You're fine. Open wide.
DOCTOR: Argh. I need to think. Come on, brain. Think, think, think. Think.
AMY: If they're fish people, it explains why they hate the sun.
DOCTOR: Stop talking. Brain thinking. Hush.
RORY: It's the school thing I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Stop talking. Brain thinking. Hush.
GUIDO: I say we take the fight to them.
DOCTOR: Ah, ah, ah.
GUIDO: What?
DOCTOR: Ah. Her planet dies, so they flee through a crack in space and time and end up here. Then she closes off the city and, one by one, starts changing the people into creatures like her to start a new gene pool. Got it. But then what? They come from the sea. They can't survive for ever on land, so what's she going to do? Unless she's going to do something to the environment to make the city habitable. She said, I shall bend the heavens to save my race. Bend the heavens. Bend the heavens. She's going to sink Venice.
GUIDO: She's going to sink Venice?
DOCTOR: And repopulate it with the girls she's transformed.
RORY: You can't repopulate somewhere with just women. You need blokes.
AMY: She's got blokes.
DOCTOR: Where?
AMY: In the canal. She said to me there are ten thousand husbands waiting in the water.
DOCTOR: Only the male offspring survived the journey here. She's got ten thousand children swimming around the canals, waiting for Mum to make them some compatible girlfriends. Urgh. I mean, I've been around a bit, but really that's, that's eugh.
DOCTOR: The people upstairs are very noisy.
GUIDO: There aren't any people upstairs.
DOCTOR: Do you know, I knew you were going to say that. Did anyone else know he was going to say that?
RORY: Is it the vampires?
DOCTOR: Like I said, they're not vampires. Fish from space.
RORY: Aren't we on the second floor?
GUIDO: What's happened to them?
DOCTOR: There's nothing left of them. They've been fully converted. Blimey, fish from space have never been so buxom. Okay, move.
RORY: Come on.
GUIDO: Give me the lamp.
DOCTOR: Go, go, go, guys. Keep moving. Go, go, go.
GUIDO: Stay away from the door, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No. Guido, What are you doing?
DOCTOR : I'm not leaving you. What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Argh, bolted.
GUIDO: Come on. That's it, keep coming. Come on.
DOCTOR: Guido!
GUIDO: Come on. Come on. Come on.
GUIDO: We are Venetians!
ROSANNA: Right. To begin, let's fill the sky with fire.
ROSANNA: Yes.
 
MAN: In sight of the Lord, protect and keep us.
DOCTOR: Rosanna's initiating the final phase.
AMY: We need to stop her. Come on.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Get back to the Tardis.
AMY: You can't stop her on your own.
DOCTOR: We don't discuss this. I tell you to do something, Amy, and you do it. Huh?
RORY: Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.
AMY: Oh my God, what is going on?
RORY: The sky, it's like it's boiling.
ROSANNA: You're too late. Such determination, just to save one city. Hard to believe it's the same man that let an entire race turn to cinders and ash. Now you can watch as my people take their new kingdom.
DOCTOR: The girls have gone, Rosanna.
ROSANNA: You're lying.
DOCTOR: Shouldn't I be dead, hmm? Rosanna, please, help me. There are two hundred thousand people in this city.
ROSANNA: So save them.
RORY: Amy, run.
RORY: This way, you freak. No! This way, you big, stupid, great SpongeBob. The only thing I've seen uglier than you is your Mum.
FRANCESCO: Huh?
RORY: No.
FRANCESCO: Did you just say something about Mummy?
AMY: Careful. Careful. Okay, hit him. This way. bring him this way. Rory!
RORY: Oh. Oh, you stink of fish.
FRANCESCO: Well, I'm hardly going to smell of cheese and biscuits.
AMY: Hey, Mummy's boy!
RORY: Oh.
AMY: That was lucky. Why did you make the sign of the cross, you numpty?
RORY: Oh. Oh, right, I'm being reviewed now, am I?
AMY: Mmm. Now we go help the Doctor.
RORY: Righty-ho.
CARLO: Open the gate!
MAN: It's the Almighty. Look at the sky!
DOCTOR: Get out. I need to stabilise the storm.
RORY: We're not leaving you.
DOCTOR: Right, so one minute it's all you make people a danger to themselves, and the next it's we're not leaving you. But if one of you gets squashed or blown up or eaten, who gets the
RORY: What was that?
DOCTOR: Nothing. Bit of an earthquake.
AMY: An earthquake?
DOCTOR: Manipulate the elements, it can trigger earthquakes. But don't worry about them.
RORY: No?
DOCTOR: No. Worry about the tidal waves caused by the earthquake. Right, Rosanna's throne is the control hub but she's locked the programme, so, tear out every single wire and circuit in the throne. Go crazy. Hit it with a stick, anything. We need it to shut down and re-route control to the secondary hub, which I'm guessing will also be the generator.
DOCTOR: Shut up. Shut up. That's better.
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh. Okay.
RORY: There he is. Come on.
RORY: Come on.
AMY: Come on.
RORY: You did it!
DOCTOR: Rosanna!
ROSANNA: One city to save an entire species. Was that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I told you, you can't go back and change time. You mourn, but you live. I know, Rosanna. I did it.
ROSANNA: Tell me, Doctor. Can your conscience carry the weight of another dead race? Remember us. Dream of us.
DOCTOR: No! No!
DOCTOR: Now then, what about you two, eh? Next stop Leadworth Registry Office. Maybe I can give you away.
RORY: It's fine. Drop me back where you found me. I'll just say you've
AMY: Stay. With us. Please. Just for a bit. I want you to stay.
DOCTOR: Fine with me.
RORY: Yeah? Yes, I would like that.
AMY: Nice one. I will pop the kettle on. Hey, look at this. Got my spaceship, got my boys. My work here is done.
RORY: Er, we are not her boys.
DOCTOR: Yeah, we are.
RORY: Yeah, we are.
DOCTOR: Rory, listen to that.
RORY: Er, what? All I can hear is silence.
ROSANNA : There were cracks. Through some we saw Silence and the end of all things.
