The Doctor's Daughter
DONNA: What the hell's it doing?
DOCTOR: The control's not working.
DOCTOR: I don't know where we're going, but my old hand's very excited about it.
DONNA: I thought that was just some freaky alien thing. You telling me it's yours?
DOCTOR: Well.
MARTHA: It got cut off. He grew a new one.
DONNA: You are completely impossible.
DOCTOR: Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.
DOCTOR: Why would the Tardis bring us here, then?
MARTHA: Oh, I love this bit.
DONNA: I thought you wanted to go home.
MARTHA: I know, but all the same, it's that feeling you get.
DONNA: Like you swallowed a hamster?
CLINE: Don't move! Stay where you are! Drop your weapons.
DOCTOR: We're unarmed. Look, no weapons. Never any weapons. We're safe.
SOLDIER: Look at their hands. They're clean.
CLINE: All right, process them. Him first.
DOCTOR: Oi, oi. What's wrong with clean hands?
MARTHA: What's going on?
DONNA: Leave him alone.
DOCTOR: Something tells me this isn't about to check my blood pressure. Argh!
DONNA: What are you doing to him?
CLINE: Everyone gets processed.
DOCTOR: It's taken a tissue sample. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. And extrapolated it. Some kind of accelerator?
MARTHA: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: What on earth? That's just
CLINE: Arm yourself.
MARTHA: Where did she come from?
DOCTOR: From me.
DONNA: From you?. How? Who is she?
DOCTOR: Well, she's, well, she's my daughter.
JENNY: Hello, Dad.
CLINE: You primed to take orders? Ready to fight?
JENNY: Instant mental download of all strategic and military protocols, sir. Generation five thousand soldier primed and in peak physical health. Oh, I'm ready.
DONNA: Did you say daughter?
DOCTOR: Mmm. Technically.
MARTHA: Technically how?
DOCTOR: Progenation. Reproduction from a single organism. Means one parent is biological mother and father. You take a sample of diploid cells, split them into haploids, then recombine them in a different arrangement and grow. Very quickly, apparently.
JENNY: Something's coming.
CLINE: It's the Hath!
JENNY: Get down!
CLINE: We have to blow the tunnel. Get the detonator.
DOCTOR: I'm not detonating anything.
CLINE: Blow the thing! Blow the thing!
DOCTOR: Martha! No. Don't.
DOCTOR: You've sealed off the tunnel. Why did you do that?
JENNY: They were trying to kill us.
DOCTOR: But they've got my friend.
JENNY: Collateral damage. At least you've still got her. He lost both his men. I'd say you came out ahead.
DONNA: Her name's Martha. And she's not collateral damage, not for anyone. Have you got that, GI Jane?
DOCTOR: I'm going to find her.
CLINE: You're going nowhere. You don't make sense, you two. No guns, no marks, no fight in you. I'm taking you to General Cobb. Now, move.
MARTHA: Hold on, I've got you. Is it your arm, yeah?
MARTHA: Is that a yes? Let me examine it. Keep still. Still, yeah? No move.
MARTHA: Half fish, half human? How am I supposed to know? Is that a shoulder? Feels like a shoulder. I think it's dislocated.
MARTHA: I'm trying to help him. I am a doctor and he is my patient, and I'm not leaving him. Now, this is going to hurt. One, two, three.
MARTHA: Now, then. I'm Doctor Martha Jones. Who the hell are you?
DONNA: I'm Donna. What's you name?
JENNY: Don't know. It's not been assigned.
DONNA: Well, if you don't know that, what do you know?
JENNY: How to fight.
DONNA: Nothing else?
DOCTOR: The machine must embed military history and tactics, but no name. She's a generated anomaly.
DONNA: Generated anomaly. Generated. Well, what about that? Jenny.
JENNY: Jenny. Yeah, I like that. Jenny.
DONNA: What do you think, Dad?
DOCTOR: Good as anything, I suppose.
DONNA: Not what you'd call a natural parent, are you?
DOCTOR: They stole a tissue sample at gunpoint and processed it. It's not what I call natural parenting.
DONNA: Rubbish. My friend Nerys fathered twins with a turkey baster. Don't bother her.
DOCTOR: You can't extrapolate a relationship from a biological accident.
DONNA: Er, Child Support Agency can.
DOCTOR: Look, just because I share certain physiological traits with simian primates doesn't make me a monkey's uncle, does it?
JENNY: I'm not a monkey. Or a child.
DOCTOR: So, where are we? What planet's this?
CLINE: Messaline. Well, what's left of it.
TANNOY: Six six three seventy five deceased. Generation six six seven one, extinct. Generation six six seven two, forty six deceased. Generation six six eight zero, fourteen deceased. Generation six
DONNA: But this is a theatre.
DOCTOR: Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon.
DONNA: It's like a town or a city underground. But why?
DOCTOR: General Cobb, I presume.
COBB: Found in the western tunnels, I'm told, with no marks. There was an outbreak of pacifism in the eastern zone three generations back, before we lost contact. Is that where you came from?
DOCTOR: Eastern zone, that's us, yeah. Yeah. I'm The Doctor, this is Donna.
JENNY: And I'm Jenny.
COBB: Don't think you can infect us with your peacemaking. We're committed to the fight, to the very end.
DOCTOR: Well, that's all right. I can't stay, anyway. I've got to go and find my friend.
COBB: That's not possible. All movement is regulated. We're at war.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed. With the Hath. But tell me, because we got a bit out of circulation, eastern zone and all that. So who exactly are the Hath? 
COBB: Back at the dawn of this planet, these ancient halls were carved from the earth. Our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning. A colony where human and Hath would work and live together.
DOCTOR: So what happened?
COBB: The dream died. Broken, along with Hath promises. They wanted it all for themselves. But those early pioneers, they fought back. They used the machines to produce soldiers instead of colonists, and began this battle for survival.
DONNA: There's nothing but earth outside, why's that? Why build everything underground?
CLINE: The surface is too dangerous.
DONNA: Well, then why build windows in the first place? And what does this mean?
COBB: The rites and symbols of our ancestors. The meaning's lost in time.
DOCTOR: How long's this war gone on for?
COBB: Longer than anyone can remember. Countless generations marked only by the dead.
DONNA: What, fighting all this time?
JENNY: Because we must. Every child of the machine is born with this knowledge. It's our inheritance. It's all we know. How to fight, and how to die.
MARTHA: Right. So we're here?
DOCTOR: Does this show the entire city, including the Hath zones?
COBB: Yes. Why?
DOCTOR: Well, it'll help us find Martha.
CLINE: We've more important things to do. The progenation machines are powered down for the night shift, but soon as they're active, we could breed a whole platoon from you two.
DONNA: I'm not having sons and daughters by some great big flipping machine. Sorry, no offence, but you're not. Well, I mean, you're not real.
JENNY: You're no better than him. I have a body, I have a mind, I have independent thought. How am I not real? What makes you better than me?
COBB: Well said, soldier. We need more like you, if ever we're to find the Source.
DOCTOR: Ooo, the Source. What's that, then? What's a Source? I like a Source. What is it?
COBB: The Breath of Life.
DOCTOR: And that would be?
CLINE: In the beginning, the great one breathed life into the universe. And then she looked at what she'd done, and she sighed.
JENNY: She. I like that.
DOCTOR: Right. So it's a creation myth.
COBB: It's not myth. It's real. That sigh. From the beginning of time it was caught and kept as the Source. It was lost when the war started. But it's here, somewhere. Whoever holds the Source controls the destiny of the planet.
DOCTOR: Ah! I thought so. There's a suppressed layer of information in this map. If I can just
DONNA: What is it, what's it mean?
DOCTOR: See? A whole complex of tunnels hidden from sight.
MARTHA: Hold on. Look.
COBB: That must be the lost temple. The Source will be inside. You've shown us the way. And look, we're closer than the Hath. It's ours.
MARTHA: That's a new map. There's a different set of tunnels.
COBB: Tell them to prepare to move out. We'll progenate new soldiers on the morning shift, then we march. Once we reach the Temple, peace will be restored at long last.
DOCTOR: Er, call me old-fashioned, but if you really wanted peace, couldn't you just stop fighting?
COBB: Only when we have the Source. It'll give us the power to erase every stinking Hath from the face of this planet.
DOCTOR: Hang on, hang on. A second ago it was peace in our time. Now you're talking about genocide.
COBB: For us, that means the same thing.
DOCTOR: Then you need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up genocide. You'll see a little picture of me there, and the caption will read, over my dead body.
COBB: And you're the one who showed us the path to victory. But you can consider the irony from your prison cell. Cline, at arms.
DONNA: Oi, oi, oi. All right. Cool the beans, Rambo.
COBB: Take them. I won't have them spreading treason. And if you try anything, Doctor, I'll see that your woman dies first.
DOCTOR: No, we're, we're not a couple.
DONNA: I am not his woman.
CLINE: Come on. This way.
DOCTOR: I'm going to stop you, Cobb. You need to know that.
COBB: I have an army and the Breath of God on my side, Doctor. What'll you have?
DOCTOR: This.
COBB: Lock them up and guard them.
CLINE: What about the new soldier?
COBB: Can't trust her. She's from pacifist stock. Take them all.
MARTHA: But I didn't do anything.
MARTHA: I think I just started a war.
DONNA: More numbers. They've got to mean something.
DOCTOR: Makes as much sense as the Breath of Life story.
JENNY: You mean that's not true?
DONNA: No, it's a myth. Isn't it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, but there could still be something real in that temple. Something that's become a myth. A piece of technology, a weapon.
DONNA: So the Source could be a weapon and we've just given directions to Captain Nutjob?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.
DONNA: Not good, is it?
DOCTOR: That's why we need to get out of here, find Martha and stop Cobb from slaughtering the Hath. What, what are you, what are you, what are you staring at?
JENNY: You keep insisting you're not a soldier, but look at you, drawing up strategies like a proper general.
DOCTOR: No, no. I'm trying to stop the fighting.
JENNY: Isn't every soldier?
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose, but that's, that's. Technically, I haven't got time for this. Donna, give me your phone. Time for an upgrade.
JENNY: And now you've got a weapon.
DOCTOR: It's not a weapon.
JENNY: But you're using it to fight back. I'm going to learn so much from you. You are such a soldier.
DOCTOR: Donna, will you tell her?
DONNA: Oh, you are speechless. I'm loving this. You keep on, Jenny.
MARTHA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Martha, you're alive!
MARTHA: Doctor! Oh, am I glad to hear your voice. Are you all right?
DOCTOR: I'm with Donna. We're fine. What about you?
DONNA: And, and Jenny. She's fine too.
DOCTOR: Yes, all right. And, and Jenny. That's the woman from the machine. The soldier. My daughter, except she isn't, she's, she's. Anyway. where are you?
MARTHA: I'm in the Hath camp. I'm okay, but something's going on. The Hath are all marching off to some place that's appeared
MARTHA : On this map thing.
DOCTOR: Oh, that was me. If both armies are heading that way, there's going to be a bloodbath.
MARTHA: What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR : Just stay where you are.
DOCTOR: If you're safe there, don't move, do you hear?
MARTHA : But
MARTHA: I can help.
MARTHA: Doctor? Doctor.
COBB: The doors that have been closed will be open to us now. The door to the Temple, to the Source, and to victory.
COBB: Come the dawn cycle, we march.
SOLDIERS : To war!
DOCTOR: They're getting ready to move out. We have to get past that guard.
JENNY: I can deal with him.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
JENNY: What?
DOCTOR: You belong here with them.
DONNA: She belongs with us. With you. She's your daughter.
DOCTOR: She's a soldier. She came out of that machine.
DONNA: Oh yes, I know that bit. Listen, have you got that stethoscope? Give it to me. Come on.
JENNY: What are you doing?
DONNA: It's all right. Just hold still.
DONNA: Come here. Listen, and then tell me where she belongs.
DOCTOR: Two hearts.
DONNA: Exactly.
JENNY: What's going on?
DONNA: Does that mean she's a, what do you call a female Time Lord?
JENNY: What's a Time Lord?
DOCTOR: It's who I am. It's where I'm from.
JENNY: And I'm from you.
DOCTOR: You're an echo, that's all. A Time Lord is so much more. A sum of knowledge, a code, a shared history, a shared suffering. Only it's gone now, all of it. Gone forever.
JENNY: What happened?
DOCTOR: There was a war.
JENNY: Like this one?
DOCTOR: Bigger. Much bigger.
JENNY: And you fought, and killed?
DOCTOR: Yes.
JENNY: Then how are we different?
MARTHA: I need to charge it up. I need power. Do you understand?
MARTHA: There's even more? In 3D. Oh, you're a clever Hath. So this is where everybody's headed? But look, those tunnels sort of zig-zag. If I went up and over the surface in a straight line, I'd get there first.
MARTHA: Why not?
MARTHA: Are these readings for the surface? Well, it doesn't look too bad. Nitrogen and oxygen about eighty twenty. That's fine. Ozone levels are high, and some big radiation spikes. But as long as I'm not out there too long.
MARTHA: I have to find my friends.
MARTHA: Come on, then.
JENNY: Hey.
CLINE: I'm not supposed to talk to you. I'm on duty.
JENNY: I know. Guarding me. So, does that mean I'm dangerous, or that I need protecting?
CLINE: Protecting from what?
JENNY: Oh, I don't know. Men like you?
JENNY: Keep quiet and open the door.
DONNA: I'd like to see you try that.
DOCTOR: That's the way out.
DOCTOR: Don't you dare.
DONNA: Let me distract this one. I have picked up a few womanly wiles over the years.
DOCTOR: Let's save your wiles for later. In case of emergency.
DOCTOR: I was going to distract him, not clobber him.
JENNY: Well, it worked, didn't it?
DOCTOR: They must all have a copy of that new map. Just stay there. Don't hurt anyone.
MARTHA: You can stay down here and live your whole life in the shadows, or come with me and stand in the open air. Feel the wind on your face. What's it going to be? It's up to you. But nothing's going to stop me.
MARTHA: I knew you couldn't resist it.
MARTHA: Er, language. Come on.
CLINE: It was the girl. She tricked me. They, they got away. I'm sorry.
COBB: I've waited all my life for this moment. No one's going to get in my way. Certainly not this Doctor. At arms! We march to war.
DOCTOR: Wait. This is it. The hidden tunnel. There must be a control panel.
DONNA: It's another one of those numbers. They're everywhere.
DOCTOR: The original builders must have left them. Some old cataloguing system.
DONNA: You got a pen? Bit of paper? Because, do you see, the numbers are counting down. This one ends in one four. The prison cell said one six.
JENNY: Always thinking, both of you. Who are you people?
DOCTOR: I told you. I'm the Doctor.
JENNY: The Doctor. That's it?
DONNA: That's all he ever says.
JENNY: So, you don't have a name either? Are you an anomaly, too?
DOCTOR: No.
DONNA: Oh, come off it. You're the most anomalous bloke I've ever met.
DOCTOR: Here it is.
JENNY: And Time Lords. What are they for, exactly?
DOCTOR: For? They're not, they're not for anything.
JENNY: So what do you do?
DOCTOR: I travel through time and space.
DONNA: He saves planets, rescues civilisations, defeats terrible creatures. And runs a lot. Seriously, there's an outrageous amount of running involved.
DOCTOR: Got it!
COBB : Squad five, with me.
DOCTOR: Now, what were you saying about running?
DONNA: That's not mood lighting, is it?
DONNA: No, I didn't think so.
DOCTOR: Arming device.
DONNA: There's more of these. Always eight numbers, counting down the closer we get.
DOCTOR: Right, here we go.
DONNA: You'd better be quick.
COBB : Corridor.
JENNY: The General.
DOCTOR: Where are you going?
JENNY: I can hold them up.
DOCTOR: No, we don't need any more dead.
JENNY: But it's them or us.
DOCTOR: It doesn't mean you have to kill them.
JENNY: I'm trying to save your life.
DOCTOR: Listen to me. The killing. After a while, it infects you. And once it does, you're never rid of it.
JENNY: We don't have a choice.
DOCTOR: We always have a choice.
JENNY: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Jenny.
SOLDIER : This door, now.
SOLDIER : There she is. At arms. Fire!
DOCTOR: I told you. Nothing but a soldier.
DONNA: She's trying to help.
DOCTOR : Jenny, come on.
JENNY: I'm coming.
COBB: Cease fire. Cease fire.
DONNA: That's it.
DOCTOR: Jenny, leave it! Let's go.
COBB: You're a child of the machine. You're on my side. Join us. Join us in the war against the Hath. It's in your blood, girl. Don't deny it.
DOCTOR: Jenny, come on. That's it.
DONNA: Hurry up.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no, no. The circuit's looped back.
DONNA: Zap it back again.
DOCTOR: The controls are back there.
JENNY: They're coming.
DOCTOR: Wait. Just. There isn't. Jenny, I can't
JENNY: I'll have to manage on my own. Watch and learn, Father.
DONNA: No way. But that was impossible.
DOCTOR: Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely. Brilliant! You were brilliant. Brilliant.
JENNY: I didn't kill him. General Cobb, I could have kill him but I didn't. You were right. I had a choice.
COBB: At arms.
DOCTOR: I warned you, Cobb. If the Source is a weapon, I'm going to make sure you never use it.
COBB: One of us is going to die today and it won't be me.
MARTHA: It can't be much further.
MARTHA: Help me! I'm sinking. I'm sinking. Help me, Peck. Help me. Help me, Peck. I'm sinking. I'm sinking.
MARTHA: Oh no! No!
JENNY: So, you travel together, but you're not together?
DONNA: What? No. No. No way. No, no, we're friends, that's all. I mean, we're not even the same species. There's probably laws against it.
JENNY: And what's it like, the travelling?
DONNA: Oh, never a dull moment. It can be terrifying, brilliant and funny, sometimes all at the same time. I've seen some amazing things though. Whole new worlds.
JENNY: Oh, I'd love to see new worlds.
DONNA: You will. Won't she, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
DONNA: Do you think Jenny will see any new worlds?
DOCTOR: I suppose so.
JENNY: You mean. You mean you'll take me with you?
DOCTOR: Well, we can't leave you here, can we?
JENNY: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Come on, let's get a move on.
DOCTOR: Careful, there might be traps.
DONNA: Kids. They never listen. Oh, I know that look. I see it a lot round our way. Blokes with pushchairs and frowns. You've got dad-shock.
DOCTOR: Dad-shock?
DONNA: Sudden unexpected fatherhood. Take a bit of getting used to.
DOCTOR: No, it's not that.
DONNA: Well, what is it then? Having Jenny in the Tardis, is that it? What's she going to do, cramp your style? Like you've got a sports car and she's going to turn it into a people-carrier?
DOCTOR: Donna, I've been a father before.
DONNA: What?
DOCTOR: I lost all that a long time ago, along with everything else.
DONNA: I'm sorry. I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? You talk all the time, but you don't say anything.
DOCTOR: I know. I'm just. When I look at her now, I can see them. The hole they left, all the pain that filled it. I just don't know if I can face that every day.
DONNA: It won't stay like that. She'll help you. We both will.
DOCTOR: But when they died, that part of me died with them. It'll never come back. Not now.
DONNA: I tell you something, Doctor. Something I've never told you before. I think you're wrong.
JENNY: They've blasted through the beams. Time to run again. Love the running. Yeah?
DOCTOR: Love the running.
DONNA: We're trapped.
DOCTOR: Can't be. This must be the Temple. This is a door.
DONNA: And again. We're down to one two now
DOCTOR: I've got it!
JENNY: I can hear them.
DOCTOR: Nearly done.
DONNA: These can't be a cataloguing system.
JENNY: They're getting closer.
DOCTOR: Then get back here.
DONNA: They're too similar. Too familiar.
JENNY: Not yet.
DOCTOR: Now! Got it.
JENNY: They're coming. Close the door.
JENNY: Oh, that was close.
DOCTOR: No fun otherwise.
DONNA: It's not what I'd call a temple.
JENNY: It looks more like
DOCTOR: Fusion drive transport. It's a spaceship.
DONNA: What, the original one? The one the first colonists arrived in?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be, but the power cells would have run down after all that time. This one's still powered-up and functioning. Come on.
JENNY: It's the Hath. That door's not going to last much longer. And if General Cobb gets through down there, war's going to break out.
DOCTOR: Look, look, look, look, look. Ship's log.
DOCTOR:  First wave of Human/Hath co-colonisation of planet Messaline.
JENNY: So it is the original ship.
DONNA: What happened?
DOCTOR: Phase one, construction. They used robot drones to build the city.
DONNA: But does it mention the war?
 Mission commander dead. Still no agreement on who should assume leadership. Hath and humans have divided into factions. That must be it. A power vacuum. The crew divided into two factions and turned on each other. Start using the progenation machines, suddenly you've got two armies fighting a never-ending war.
JENNY: Two armies who are now both outside.
DONNA: Look at that.
DOCTOR: It's like the numbers in the tunnels.
DONNA: No, no, no, no. But listen, I spent six months working as a temp in Hounslow Library, and I mastered the Dewey Decimal System in two days flat. I'm good with numbers. It's staring us in the face.
JENNY: What is?
DONNA: It's the date. Assuming the first two numbers are some big old space date, then you've got year, month, day. It's the other way round, like it is in America
DOCTOR: Oh! It's the New Byzantine Calendar.
DONNA: The codes are completion dates for each section. They finish it, they stamp the date on. So the numbers aren't counting down, they're going out from here, day by day, as the city got built.
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, good work, Donna.
DONNA: Yeah. But you're still not getting it. The first number I saw back there, was sixty twelve oh seven seventeen. Well, look at the date today.
DOCTOR: Oh seven twenty four. No.
JENNY: What does it mean?
DOCTOR: Seven days.
DONNA: That's it. Seven days.
DOCTOR: Just seven days.
JENNY: What do you mean, seven days?
DOCTOR: Seven days since war broke out.
DONNA: This war started seven days ago. Just a week. A week!
JENNY: They said years.
DONNA: No, they said generations. And if they're all like you, and they're products of those machines
DOCTOR: They could have twenty generations in a day. Each generation gets killed in the war, passes on the legend. Oh, Donna, you're a genius.
JENNY: But all the buildings, the encampments. They're in ruins.
DOCTOR: No, they're not ruined. They're just empty. Waiting to be populated. Oh, they've mythologised their entire history. The Source must be part of that too. Come on.
MARTHA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Martha! Oh, I should have known you wouldn't stay away from the excitement.
MARTHA: Donna.
DONNA: Oh, you're filthy. What happened?.
MARTHA: I, er, took the surface route.
COBB : Positions.
DOCTOR: That's the General. We haven't got much time.
DONNA: We don't even know what we're looking for.
MARTHA: Is it me, or can you smell flowers?
COBB : Maintain defensive positions.
DOCTOR: Yes. Bougainvillea. I say we follow our nose.
COBB : Squads seven to ten, advance. With me.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes. Isn't this brilliant?
DONNA: Is that the Source?
JENNY: It's beautiful.
MARTHA: What is it?
DOCTOR: Terraforming. It's a third generation terraforming device.
DONNA: So why are we suddenly in Kew Gardens?
DOCTOR: Because that's what it does. All this, only bigger. Much bigger. It's in a transit state. Producing all this must help keep it stable before they finally
DOCTOR: Stop! Hold your fire!
COBB: What is this, some kind of trap?
DOCTOR: You said you wanted this war over.
COBB: I want this war won.
DOCTOR: You can't win. No one can. You don't even know why you're here. Your whole history, it's just Chinese whispers, getting more distorted the more it's passed on. This is the Source. This is what you're fighting over. A device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem. It's nothing mystical. It's from a laboratory, not some creator. It's a bubble of gases. A cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution. Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids. It's used to make barren planets habitable. Look around you. It's not for killing, it's bringing life. If you allow it, it can lift you out of these dark tunnels and into the bright, bright sunlight. No more fighting, no more killing.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, and I declare this war is over.
JENNY: What's happening?
DOCTOR: The gases will escape and trigger the terraforming process.
JENNY: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It means a new world.
JENNY: No!
DOCTOR: Jenny? Jenny. Talk to me, Jenny.
DONNA: Is she going to be all right?
JENNY: A new world. It's beautiful.
DOCTOR: Jenny, be strong now. You need to hold on, do you hear me? We've got things to do, you and me, hey? Hey? We can go anywhere. Everywhere. You choose.
JENNY: That sounds good.
DOCTOR: You're my daughter, and we've only just got started. You're going to be great. You're going to be more than great. You're going to be amazing. You hear me? Jenny?
DOCTOR: Two hearts. Two hearts. She's like me. If we wait. If we just wait.
MARTHA: There's no sign, Doctor. There is no regeneration. She's like you, but maybe not enough.
DOCTOR: No. Too much. That's the truth of it. She was too much like me.
DOCTOR: I never would. Have you got that? I never would. When you start this new world, this world of Human and Hath, remember that. Make the foundation of this society a man who never would.
MARTHA: It's happening. The terraforming.
DONNA: Build a city, nice and safe underground, strip away the top soil and there it is. And what about Jenny?
CLINE: Let us give her a proper ceremony. I think it'd help us. Please.
DOCTOR: Jenny was the reason for the Tardis bringing us here. It just got here too soon, which then created Jenny in the first place. Paradox. An endless paradox. Time to go home?
MARTHA: Yeah. Home.
DONNA: Are you sure about this?
MARTHA: Yeah, positive. I can't do this any more. You'll be the same one day.
DONNA: Not me. Never. How could I ever go back to normal life after seeing all this? I'm going to travel with that man for ever.
MARTHA: Good luck.
DONNA: And you.
DOCTOR: We're making a habit of this.
