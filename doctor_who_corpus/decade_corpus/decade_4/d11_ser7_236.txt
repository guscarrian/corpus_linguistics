Journey to the Centre of the Tardis
COMPUTER: Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate. Incoming salvage. Please validate.
BRAM: Rusty garbage. It's not worth lacing up my boots.
TRICKY: Wasting our time. There's no salvage this far out.
BRAM: You're a lucky boy, Tricky. You're an android. You don't get bored.
TRICKY: He won't turn back. Not with half a cargo.
BRAM: He's not captain. We're equal partners.
TRICKY: Yeah. Right.
DOCTOR: You said
CLARA: I know what I said. I was the one who said it.
DOCTOR: You said it was looking at you funny.
CLARA: I was tired, overwrought. I didn't mean it. It's an appliance. It does a job.
DOCTOR: It's a pretty cool appliance. We're not talking cheese grater here.
CLARA: You're not getting me to talk to your ship. That's properly bonkers.
DOCTOR:  It's okay, it's okay.
CLARA: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his mother approves.
DOCTOR: It's important to me you get along. I could leave you two alone together.
CLARA: Now you're creeping me out.
DOCTOR: Take the wheel. Not the wheel. I'll make it easy. Shut it down to basic mode for you.
CLARA: Basic? Because I'm a girl?
DOCTOR: No.
BRAM: It's just trash.
TRICKY: No, look. There's something tasty in the magno-field.
COMPUTER: Magno-grab ready. Engaging.
GREGOR: Move yourself.
CLARA: What have I done?
DOCTOR: Er, okay.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: All the electrical impulses are jammed. I can't get the shields back up. She's completely vulnerable.
CLARA: I swear I just touched it.
DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.
CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button.
CLARA: You're lying.
DOCTOR: Yep.
CLARA: To stop me freaking out?
DOCTOR: Is it working?
CLARA: Not so much.
TRICKY: What is it, some kind of escape pod?
GREGOR: Come on.
GREGOR: Crack it open.
BRAM: It's doing nothing.
GREGOR: Use the thermo-charge and blast it.
TRICKY: No, no, no, wait. It's like she's alive. She's, she's suffering. I can feel it. I can feel it.
That's just robot rant.
BRAM: No, Gregor, he's right. Looks like there's a broken fuel line.
GREGOR: All right. All right, put it back. No salvage today, boys. Open the bay doors.
TRICKY: Wait.
TRICKY: Somebody's under that thing. The crew were still on board when we dragged her in.
GREGOR: We did nothing. If anyone asks, that ship was already busted. You got that? And you, make sure you keep your oily mouth shut, right?
DOCTOR: It's rude to whisper. Hi. I'm the Doctor. And you are? Er, Van Baalen and Van Baalen. Van Baalen and Van Baalen. That's going to get confusing later.
GREGOR: We found you drifting.
BRAM: Yeah, your ship was junked up pretty bad.
DOCTOR: What broke my ship was a magno-grab. Found this remote in your pocket. Eh? What are the chances? Outlawed in most galaxies, this little beastie can disable whole vessels unless you have shield oscillators, which I turned off so that Clara could fly, damn it. Clara. Where is she? Girl, about so high. Feisty. She's still on board.
TRICKY: No, wait. Your pod is leaking fuel. If she's still in here, she's dead.
DOCTOR: Ah, respirators.
GREGOR: We can open the doors for a split second, reach in and grab her.
DOCTOR: Trust me, we can't. Now please, help me get her out.
TRICKY: I'm telling you, she fried
GREGOR: Shut it, tin mouth. What sort of fee are we talking?
DOCTOR: If you help me get her out, you get the machine, all the scrap, eh?
BRAM: It's not worth the risk. Four feet of metal? Nah.
DOCTOR: What if I can guarantee you the best haul you've ever had?
GREGOR: Bram, open the bay doors.
DOCTOR: No, no. Please, stop. Listen, listen. Right behind those doors is the salvage of a lifetime.
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor?
CLARA: Red flashing light means something bad. Get out of here fast? Or possibly, whatever you do, don't open this door.
CLARA: Bad decision.
BRAM: Hey, are we really going to risk it? That thing is spewing poison. We should blow it back into space.
GREGOR: Get your gear.
BRAM: Hey, I don't take orders from my kid brother.
GREGOR: Don't try and form sentences, all right? Stick to what you do best.
DOCTOR: Tell me, since when does an android need a blast suit and a respirator?
BRAM: Flesh coating, same as us. He'd burn up.
TRICKY: No fear, no hate, no pain.
GREGOR: Salvage of a lifetime?
DOCTOR: I feel pretty confident I can deliver on that. Here we go.
GREGOR: I don't get it. I thought she was lying on her side.
DOCTOR: The Tardis is special. She has her own gravity. I'd explain if I had some charts and a board pen.
GREGOR: It's, it's, it's bigger
DOCTOR: On the inside. Do you know, I get that a lot.
TRICKY: Whoa. Awesome.
DOCTOR: Well put. Whoa and awesome.
DOCTOR: Safe to breathe.
DOCTOR: Okay, now, the last thing I remember, you were right there. Come on, Clara, talk to me.
BRAM: How big is this baby?
DOCTOR: Picture the biggest ship you've ever seen. Are you picturing it?
BRAM: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good. Now forget it, because this ship is infinite.
GREGOR: It could take you hours to find the girl.
DOCTOR: Days. Plus this whole place is toxic. She could be dead by the time I reach her. So, here's the mission. We're going to find her in one hour.
GREGOR: We?
DOCTOR: You're my guys for this.
GREGOR: That wasn't the deal.
DOCTOR: 'Tis now.
BRAM: What makes you think we'll help?
DOCTOR: I just activated the Tardis self-destruct system. One hour until this ship blows.
DOCTOR: Don't try to leave. The Tardis is in lockdown. I'll open those doors when Clara's by my side.
BRAM: You crazy lunatic!
DOCTOR: My ship, my rules.
GREGOR: You'll kill us all. And the girl.
DOCTOR: She's going to die if you don't help me. Don't get into a spaceship with a madman. Didn't anyone ever teach you that? Okay, a little gently persuasion. Say thirty minutes.
BRAM: She'll die even quicker now!
DOCTOR: We all perform better under pressure. Anybody want to go for fifteen minutes?
BRAM: Whoa!
GREGOR: Whoa!
DOCTOR: It's your own time you're wasting. Salvage of a lifetime. You meant the ship. I meant Clara.
CLARA: Oh!
GREGOR: Report. What's on board this thing?
COMPUTER: Dynomorphic generators, conceptual geometer, beam synthesiser, orthogonal engine filters.
GREGOR: Guys, guys, look, I think we should split up. It's our best chance of finding the girl. You know it is.
DOCTOR: Don't touch a thing. The Tardis will get huffy if you mess.
GREGOR: Keep in radio contact, all right?
GREGOR: Get back to the console. Strip it apart.
BRAM: Okay.
GREGOR: All right?
SUSAN : I made up the name Tardis from the initials Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
DOCTOR 3 : The Tardis is dimensionally transcendental.
JO: : What does that mean?
DOCTOR 4 : That's trans-dimensional engineering. A key Time Lord discovery.
DOCTOR 9 : The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door. Believe me, they've tried.
AMY : We are in space!
IAN : It can move anywhere in time and space?
COMPUTER: Everything.
GREGOR: What? Report.
COMPUTER: Everything, behind that door.
GREGOR: Everything?
COMPUTER: Sensor detects everything you could possibly want.
COMPUTER: Everything.
GREGOR: I don't understand. Give me a price tag.
COMPUTER: Incalculable.
GREGOR: What?
COMPUTER: More valuable than the total sum of any currency. Living metal. Bespoke engineering. Whatever machine you require, this system will build it.
DOCTOR: No! No, no, stop! Please, don't. Don't touch it. Please. She won't let you touch it. I can feel a Tardis tantrum coming on.
GREGOR: What the hell is this place?
DOCTOR: Architectural Reconfiguration System. It reconstructs particles according to your needs.
GREGOR: A machine that makes machines?
DOCTOR: Yes, basically. What are you doing? No, no, don't. Don't!
DOCTOR: If you walk out of here with that circuit, the Tardis will try to stop you. Now listen to me. Look, the clock is ticking. We must find Clara.
GREGOR: What the? Where's the door gone?
DOCTOR: Ever seen a spaceship get ugly?
GREGOR: This isn't happening.
DOCTOR: She won't relinquish it. Her basic genetic material.
GREGOR: Torch it. I said, torch it.
TRICKY: Can't you feel it, Gregor? The ship, the ship's in torment, like it's a living thing. You can't hurt it.
GREGOR: What's the matter, Tardis? Scared to fight me?
CLARA: So that's who
TRICKY: It's the same. It's just the same.
DOCTOR: It's diverting us, spinning a maze around us. We will never reach Clara in time.
DOCTOR: Hey! Hey!
TRICKY: It's just the same, again.
DOCTOR: No point in building walls. You'll just know how to smash them down. It's found other ways of controlling you. Smart bunch, Time Lords. No dress sense, dreadful hats, but smart. If you want to get out of here, let that circuit go. It is creating a labyrinth.
GREGOR: Bram? Bram, can you hear me?
GREGOR : Bram, the ship is alive. Get out of there. Bram, don't touch anything.
BRAM: You're just the sweetest thing ever.
CLARA: Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
CLARA: No! The door. Where's the door gone? No. You can't do this.
GREGOR : Bram? You've got to get out of there fast.
GREGOR: Channel's dead.
TRICKY: We've got to help him. Gregor, do something. Do something!
GREGOR: It's too late, he's gone. Let's just worry about the salvage.
TRICKY: You care more about that circuit than you do about him.
DOCTOR: Your concern for your brother is really touching. The android is more cut up about it that you. Now will you two stop bickering and listen. There is something else down there.
TRICKY: We've got to get out of here. Gregor, give it back. Give it back to her.
GREGOR: What are you doing? You're always on the side of the machines.
DOCTOR: Fellas! Multiple lifeforms on board the Tardis with us. I am getting a massive signal.
TRICKY: Where are they?
DOCTOR: Oh, you're not going to like the answer. About two steps away. One step.
DOCTOR: Gregor, look out! Careful! Gregor, no! We have to stay together. Come on, run. Tricky, run. I'm sorry.
CLARA: Oh, why are you doing this?
TRICKY: Back where we started.
DOCTOR: No, it's an echo. The console room is the safest place on the ship. It can replicate itself any number of times. It's trying to protect us.
TRICKY: Because I tried to give back the circuit?
DOCTOR: Team Tardis.
TRICKY: Where did, where did that go?
DOCTOR: There's more than one echo room. Hey, look, look. The Tardis has got Clara safe. That was her. That was her there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
TRICKY: Why can't we see her?
DOCTOR: It's like a light switch. Two positions, flickering at super-infinite speeds. We're only together for a brief second. Shush.
DOCTOR: I can hear her.
TRICKY: She's let it in. She's let it in!
DOCTOR: If I can just isolate her position, I can nudge the alternation, reach in and grab her.
CLARA: Who are you?
COMPUTER: Console room, echo imprint of the original.
GREGOR: You're coming with me. I need you to get me out of here.
COMPUTER: Scanning for female human. Scanning for female human. Unidentified human.
DOCTOR: It doesn't know Lancashire.
GREGOR: What?
DOCTOR: It doesn't know sass. Yes! It's found Clara. It's found her. She is right there.
DOCTOR: It's all right. Clara, I'm so, so sorry. Sorry. Please, please forgive me, Clara.
DOCTOR: Ow! Okay, so we're not doing hugging. I get that now.
CLARA: What do you keep in here? Why have you got zombie creatures? Good guys do not have zombie creatures. Rule one basic storytelling.
DOCTOR: Not in front of the guests.
CLARA: Who are they?
DOCTOR: Friends. Well, people who aren't trying to kill us, so I don't need punching again.
GREGOR: All right, all right. Look, a deal's a deal. You got the girl back. Now cancel the self-destruct.
DOCTOR: Ah. Ah. You know, I've got to tell you, I won't be needing you in my quiz team.
GREGOR: What?
DOCTOR: There is no self-destruct. Hey? Hey? Hey? Had you going though, boys, didn't I? I just wiggled a few buttons. Yeah, the old wiggly button trick. And the face. You've got to do the face. Save her or we all die. I though I rushed it a bit, but
TRICKY: So you're telling us we're safe?
DOCTOR: Ish. Apart from the monsters and the Tardis reinventing the architecture every five minutes. Guys, don't worry. The countdown's a fake. Look, just give me a second. I'll turn it off. I only made it look as though the engine was actually exploding.
DOCTOR: Ah. That's not good. Okay, don't panic. Or maybe panic.
CLARA: Something you want to share with the rest of us?
DOCTOR: It appears the engine is damaged. We're in trouble, Clara. Proper trouble. It needs fixing or we're toast.
CLARA: So now would be a good time to use that big friendly button, right?
DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry, I should have had one built in.
TRICKY: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Detour.
DOCTOR: The centre of the Tardis.
CLARA: Shush. Something's in here.
TRICKY: Those things, they've followed us.
CLARA: Doctor, what are they? What aren't you telling me?
DOCTOR: Trust me. Some things you don't want to know.
GREGOR: They're on the move again.
DOCTOR: Run. Move, move.
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor? Again.
CLARA 2: I know what I said. I was the one who said it.
DOCTOR : You said it was looking at you funny.
CLARA 2: Now you're creeping me out. Please tell me there is a button you can press to fix this?
CLARA: Oh, thank god. Doctor, what's going on? Say something.
DOCTOR: Clara, stop. Don't touch it. There's a rupture in time somewhere on board the ship. A small tear in the fabric of the continuum. It must have happened when the Tardis was pulled in by the salvage vessel. The Tardis is leaking.
CLARA: Leaking what?
DOCTOR: The past. You and me. Everything we've done, everything we've said. Recent history. It's not real. It's a memory.
CLARA: What about this?
DOCTOR: If you're giving me the option, I'd say this one's real.
DOCTOR: She's right on to us.
CLARA: She?
DOCTOR: Clara, don't ask me any more.
CLARA 2: You're like one of those guys who can't go out with a girl unless his mother approves.
DOCTOR : It's important to me you get along.
CLARA: What's that noise?
DOCTOR: We're right under the primary fuel cells.
CLARA: So? So, so what?
DOCTOR: So, so the fuel's spilled out, so the rods will be exposed. Means they'll cool
CLARA: And start to warp.
DOCTOR: And start to warp. Maybe even
CLARA: No, you don't say it. Don't you dare say it.
DOCTOR: Maybe even break apart.
CLARA: Run?
DOCTOR: I'm liking how you're thinking.
CLARA: Yeah.
TRICKY: Cut it off. Just cut my arm off.
GREGOR: No.
TRICKY: It's the quickest way to release me. No fear, no hate, no pain. I can get a new one. Disposable parts. Just do it. It won't hurt me.
GREGOR: Tricky, you just don't understand.
TRICKY: I'm an android. Cut me!
CLARA: You made it through.
TRICKY: What's the matter with you? Why won't you cut me?
DOCTOR: Tell him.
TRICKY: Tell me what?
DOCTOR: You can't, can you. You're a coward. You won't save him, but you're scared to tell him why.
TRICKY: What's he going on about?
DOCTOR: Robots don't need blast suits. They don't need respirators. They don't get frightened of monsters in the dark.
TRICKY: What's he talking about?
DOCTOR: Two bionic eyes and a synthetic voice box. But you, my friend, are human. Flesh and blood.
GREGOR: It was a joke.
TRICKY: What?
GREGOR: It was just a stupid joke. We did it to relieve the boredom.
DOCTOR: Well, it was very funny. They lied to you. Changed your identity just to provide some in-flight entertainment.
GREGOR: I'm sorry. You're human, Tricky.
DOCTOR: Cut the metal. Cut the metal! Go!
GREGOR: Where are we?
DOCTOR: Power source. Right, you lot, wait here. I'll check it's safe. We can only survive for a minute or two in there.
CLARA: Er, what happens if we stay longer?
DOCTOR: Our cells with liquefy and our skin will start to burn.
CLARA: I always feel so good after we've spoken.
DOCTOR: Marvellous. Keep this door shut.
CLARA: That will not be a problem.
COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass.
GREGOR: Intelligent sensor.
TRICKY: Ever pointed that thing at yourself, Gregor? What would it see? What sort of person does this to another human? Made them believe they're made of metal. Who am I?
GREGOR: My mouthy little kid brother.
TRICKY: Why, why can't I remember?
GREGOR: It was a salvage accident. There was a big explosion. You lost your sight, voice and your memory.
TRICKY: And you, you thought of a way you could have some fun with me? I just wanted a brother beside me!
GREGOR: You were always the smart one, Tricky. He wanted you to take over. He made you captain.
TRICKY: He?
GREGOR: Dad.
TRICKY: I don't remember him. You did this to me just to be captain of a heap of junk.
DOCTOR: Stop! Tricky, listen to me. Ask yourself why he couldn't cut you up. He has just one tiny scrap of decency left in him, and you helped him find that, okay? Now you. Don't ever forget this.
DOCTOR: Okay, move, move, move.
DOCTOR: The Eye of Harmony. Exploding star in the act of becoming a black hole. Time Lord engineering. You rip the star from its orbit, suspend it in a permanent state of decay. This way, quickly.
GREGOR: There's no way out. We're trapped.
CLARA: You're going to tell me right now. If we're going to die here, you're going to tell me what they are.
DOCTOR: I can't.
CLARA: Tell me. What's the use in secrets now?
DOCTOR: Secrets protect us. Secrets make us safe.
CLARA: We're not safe!
COMPUTER: Sensor detects animal DNA. Human core element. Calculating data. Calculating data.
DOCTOR: No, no, turn it off!
COMPUTER: Lancashire. Sass. Identifiable substance. Clara.
CLARA: That's me.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.
CLARA: It's me. I burn in here.
DOCTOR: It isn't just the past leaking out through the time rift. It's the future. Listen, I brought you here to keep you safe, but it happened again. You died again.
CLARA: What do you mean, again?
DOCTOR: Hang on. As long as we can interrupt the timeline, this can't happen. Don't touch each other, otherwise the future will reassert itself.
DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor, let go of the circuit.
TRICKY: Just let it go.
DOCTOR: Gregor, Gregor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Er, er
GREGOR: Tricky!
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, don't touch him, or time will reassert itself.
DOCTOR: The engine room. The heart of the Tardis.
CLARA: We're outside.
DOCTOR: No, we're still in the Tardis.
CLARA: There's no way across.
DOCTOR: No, okay, you're right.
CLARA: So what do we do? Time for a plan. Do you have a plan?
DOCTOR: Well, no. No plan. Sorry.
CLARA: If you don't have a plan, we're dead.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. So just tell me.
CLARA: Tell you what?
DOCTOR: Well, there's no point now. We're about to die. Just tell me who you are.
CLARA: You know who I am.
DOCTOR: No, I don't. I look at you every single day and I don't understand a thing about you. Why do I keep running into you?
CLARA: Doctor, you invited me. You said
DOCTOR: Before that. I met you in the Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck and she died saving my life, and she was you.
CLARA: She really wasn't.
DOCTOR: Victorian London. There was a governess who was really a barmaid, and we fought the Great Intelligence together. She died and it was my fault, and she was you.
CLARA: You're scaring me.
DOCTOR: What are you, eh? Are you a trick, a trap?
CLARA: I don't know what you're talking about!
DOCTOR: You really don't, do you.
CLARA: I think I'm more scared of you right now than anything else on that Tardis.
DOCTOR: You're just Clara, aren't you.
CLARA: Okay, I don't know what the hell this is about, but the hug is really nice.
DOCTOR: We're not going to die here. This isn't real! It's a snarl.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: What does a wounded animal do? It tries to scare everyone away. We're close to the engine. The Tardis is snarling at us, trying to frighten us off. We need to jump.
CLARA: You're insane.
DOCTOR: We'll cross a portal to the engine.
CLARA: How can you be so sure?
DOCTOR: I can't.
CLARA: Okay, well, that's watertight.
DOCTOR: Hey now, Clara, I have piloted this ship for over nine hundred years. Trust me this one time, please. Okay. Okay. As well as all the other times. Ready? Geronimo.
DOCTOR: The heart of the Tardis. The engine, it's already exploded. It must have been the collision with the salvage ship.
CLARA: We're not dead.
DOCTOR: She wrapped her hands around the force. Froze it.
CLARA: So, so it's safe?
DOCTOR: Temporary fix. Eventually this whole place will erupt. There's no way I can save her now. She's just always been there for me, and taken care of me, and now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. I think it just
DOCTOR: Oh, Clara. Oh.
DOCTOR: You are beautiful. Beautiful fragile human skin. Like parchment. Thank you. The rift in time. All the memories leaking out. I need to find the moment we crashed. I need to find the music.
DOCTOR: The time rift. Recent past, possible future.
CLARA: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Rewrite today, I hope.
DOCTOR: I've thrown this through the rift before. I need to make sure this time. Going to take it in there myself. There might be a certain amount of yelling.
CLARA: It's going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Things that end your life often do that.
CLARA: Wait! All those things you said. How we've met before, how I died.
DOCTOR: Clara, don't worry. You'll forget. Time mends us. It can mend anything.
CLARA: I don't want to forget. Not all of it. The library. I saw it. You were mentioned in a book.
DOCTOR: I'm mentioned in a lot of books.
CLARA: You call yourself Doctor. Why do you do that? You have a name. I've seen it. In one corner of that tiny
DOCTOR: If I rewrite today, you won't remember. You won't go looking for my name.
CLARA: You'll still have secrets.
DOCTOR: It's better that way.
DOCTOR: Magnetic hobble-field. We're flying right into it. Clara, stay by me.
CLARA: Please tell me there's a button you can press to fix this.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Big friendly button.
CLARA: You're lying.
DOCTOR: Yep.
CLARA: To stop me freaking out?
DOCTOR: Is it working?
CLARA: Not so much.
FUTURE DOCTOR: Doctor, Doctor. I'm from your future. We haven't got long to reset time.
DOCTOR: Clara, no! No!
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Big friendly button.
TRICKY: I don't get it. It was on screen, then it was gone.
BRAM: Hey, robot, go get me some food. I'm starving.
GREGOR: Oi, leave him alone.
BRAM: What's the matter with you?
GREGOR: Maybe I've just got a little tiny scrap of decency.
CLARA: I feel exhausted. I feel
DOCTOR: We've had two days crammed into the space of one.
CLARA: Why would you say that?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I say stuff. Ignore me. Do you feel safe?
CLARA: Of course.
DOCTOR: Give me a number out of ten. Ten being whoo hoo, one being argh.
CLARA: You're being weird.
DOCTOR: I need to know if you feel safe. I need to know you're not afraid.
CLARA: Of?
DOCTOR: The future. Running away with a spaceman in a box. Anything could happen to you.
CLARA: That's what I'm counting on. Push the button.
