Army of Ghosts
ROSE : Planet Earth. This is where I was born. And this is where I died. For the first nineteen years of my life, nothing happened. Nothing at all. Not ever. And then I met a man called the Doctor.
DOCTOR 9: Run.
ROSE : A man who could change his face. And he took me away from home in his magical machine. He showed me the whole of time and space. I thought it would never end.
DOCTOR: How long are you going to stay with me?
ROSE: Forever.
ROSE : That's what I thought. But then came the army of ghosts. Then came Torchwood and the War. And that's when it all ended. This is the story of how I died.
ROSE : Mum, it's us! We're back!
JACKIE: Oh, I don't know why you bother with that phone. You never use it!
ROSE: Shut up, come here!
JACKIE: Oh, I love you!
ROSE: I love you!
JACKIE: I love you so much!
JACKIE: Oh no, you don't. Come here!
JACKIE: Oh, you lovely big fella! Oh, you're all mine.
DOCTOR: Just, just, just put me down!
JACKIE: Yes, you are.
ROSE: I've got loads of washing for you. And I got you this.
ROSE: It's from the market on this asteroid bazaar. It's made of, er, what's it called?
DOCTOR: Bazoolium.
ROSE: Bazoolium. When it gets cold, yeah, it means it's going to rain. When it's hot, it's going to be sunny. You can use it to tell the weather.
JACKIE: I've got a surprise for you and all.
ROSE: Oh, I get her bazoolium, she doesn't even say thanks.
JACKIE: Guess who's coming to visit? You're just in time. He'll be here at ten past. Who do you think it is?
ROSE: I don't know.
JACKIE: Oh go on, guess.
ROSE: No, I hate guessing. Just tell me.
JACKIE: It's your granddad. Granddad Prentice. He's on his way any minute, Right, cup of tea!
ROSE: She's gone mad.
DOCTOR: Tell me something new.
ROSE: Granddad Prentice, that's her dad. But he died, like, ten years ago. Oh, my God. She's lost it. Mum? What you just said about granddad.
JACKIE: Any second now.
ROSE: But he passed away. His heart gave out. Do you remember that?
JACKIE: Of Course I do.
ROSE: Then how can he come back?
JACKIE: Why don't you ask him yourself? Ten past. Here he comes.
JACKIE: Here we are, then. Dad, say hello to Rose. Ain't she grown?
DOCTOR: They're everywhere!
ROSE: Doctor, look out!
JACKIE: They haven't got long. Midday shift only lasts a couple of minutes. They're about to fade.
DOCTOR: What do you mean, shift? Since when did ghosts have shifts? Since when did shifts have ghosts? What's going on?
JACKIE: Oh, he's not happy when I know more than him, is he?
DOCTOR: But no one's running or screaming or freaking out.
JACKIE: Why should we? Here we go. Twelve minutes past.
YVONNE: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to announce we've just measured the ghost energy at five thousand gigawatts. Give yourselves a round of applause.
ALISTAIR APPLETON : On today's Ghostwatch, claims that some of the ghosts are starting to talk, and there seems to be a regular formation gathering around Westminster Bridge. It's almost like a military display.
DOCTOR: What the hell's going on?
WEATHERMAN : And tonight we're expecting very strong ghosts from London, through the North and up into Scotland.
TRISHA : So basically, Eileen, what you're telling me is, that you are in love with a ghost.
EILEEN : He's my ghost, and I love him twenty four seven.
DEREK ACORAH : Well, no one needs me anymore!
HOUSEWIFE : My ghost was pale and grey until I discovered Ectoshine!
FRENCH NEWSREADER : Et le President d'aujourd'hui, quelle est
JACKIE: Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: It's all over the world.
PEGGY : Listen to me, Den Watts. I don't care if you have come back from the grave. Get out of my pub! The only spirits I'm serving in this place are gin, whisky and vodka. So, you heard me. Get out!
DOCTOR: When did it start?
JACKIE: Well, first of all, Peggy heard this noise in the cellar, so she goes down
DOCTOR: No, I mean worldwide.
JACKIE: Oh. That was about two months ago. Just happened. Woke up one morning, and there they all were. Ghosts, everywhere. We all ran round screaming and that. Whole planet was panicking. No sign of you, thank you very much. Then it sort of sank in. It took us time to realise that we're lucky.
ROSE: What makes you think it's granddad?
JACKIE: It just feels like him. There's that smell, those old cigarettes. Can't you smell it?
ROSE: I wish I could, mum, but I can't.
JACKIE: You've got to make an effort. You've got to want it, sweetheart.
DOCTOR: The more you want it, the stronger it gets.
JACKIE: Sort of, yeah.
DOCTOR: Like a psychic link. Of course you want your old dad to be alive, but you're wishing him into existence. The ghosts are using that to pull themselves in.
JACKIE: You're spoiling it.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Jackie, but there's no smell, there's no cigarettes. Just a memory.
ROSE: But if they're not ghosts, what are they then?
JACKIE: Yeah, but they're human! You can see them. They look human.
ROSE: She's got a point. I mean, they're all sort of blurred, but they're definitely people.
DOCTOR: Maybe not. They're pressing themselves into the surface of the world. But a footprint doesn't look like a boot.
YVONNE: So, what've we got? Any sign of that power loss?
ADEOLA: There's no problems. Must've been a glitch.
YVONNE: Rajesh?
YVONNE : You got anything?
RAJESH: It's so busy down here, I'm on Sudoku book 509.
YVONNE: Well, we just had a great ghost shift.
RAJESH : I know.
RAJESH: But we had nothing. Did they tell you? RND came up with a new spectrometer yesterday. Barged in here, all full of themselves. Said they could detect the heat off a single protozoa through half a mile of steel.
YVONNE : And what did they find?
RAJESH: Nothing. It gave them nothing. Same as ever. The machines keep saying the sphere can't exist. But there it is.
YVONNE : Anything we can do?
RAJESH: No, I'm all right. It's just, it gets into your head, this thing. Like it's staring at you.
YVONNE : All right, we'll catch up later. Thanks, Raj.
RAJESH: Yeah.
YVONNE: Matt, get on to hospitality, will you? Send Rajesh something. He's going mad down there. Not alcohol.
ADEOLA : god im bored.
GARETH text]: me too yawn
ADEOLA : fancy a coffee?
GARETH : though u never ask :)
MAN : Kept it stable at fifty six point one.
YVONNE : So, if you just check the statistics.
GARETH: Yvonne? I'm going to double check the stacks, just in case.
YVONNE: Sure.
ADEOLA: Yvonne, I'm going to go and cross reference the levels with the sphere.
YVONNE: Okay, fine.
YVONNE: And they think we haven't noticed.
GARETH: Come on. It'll be all right down here. Just two minutes.
ADEOLA: This is out of bounds.
GARETH: Yeah, and that's the point. It's completely safe. They're just building new offices.
ADEOLA: What about the workmen?
GARETH: They must be allocated somewhere else.
ADEOLA: It's not worth it for a snog.
GARETH: It is. Come on. 
ADEOLA: Gareth? Now, don't be daft, where've you gone? Gareth! Look, I'm going to head back. I'm seeing you tonight anyway. Gareth? I'm going to go back to work.
ADEOLA: This is it. I'm going. See you. Now stop it, Gareth. I'm not kidding, just stop it!
ADEOLA: Sorry, I'm just looking for my friend. Did anyone come down here?
ROSE: According to the paper, they've elected a ghost as MP for Leeds. Now don't tell me you're going to sit back and do nothing.
DOCTOR: Who you going to call?
ROSE: Ghostbusters!
DOCTOR: I ain't afraid of no ghosts.
DOCTOR: When's the next shift?
JACKIE: Quarter to. But don't go causing trouble. What's that lot do?
DOCTOR: Triangulates their point of origin.
ROSE: I don't suppose it's the Gelth?
DOCTOR: Nah. They were just coming through one little rift. This lot are transposing themselves over the whole planet. Like tracing paper.
JACKIE: You're always doing this. Reducing it to science. Why can't it be real? Just think of it, though. All the people we've lost. Our families coming back home. Don't you think it's beautiful?
DOCTOR: I think it's horrific. Rose, give us a hand.
DOCTOR: As soon as the cones activate, if that line goes into the red, press that button there. If it doesn't stop
DOCTOR: Setting fifteen B. Hold it against the port, eight seconds and stop.
ROSE: Fifteen B, eight seconds.
DOCTOR: If it goes into the blue, activate the deep scan on the left.
ROSE: Hang on a minute, I know. Push that one.
DOCTOR: Close.
ROSE: That one?
DOCTOR: Now you've just killed us.
ROSE: Er, that one.
DOCTOR: Yeah! Now, what've we got. Two minutes to go?
YVONNE: Two minutes to the next shift. Let's make it a good one, people.
YVONNE: Come on, you two.
ADEOLA: I'm sorry we're late.
YVONNE: Save it 'til later.
GARETH: Sorry we're late.
YVONNE: And powering up.
DOCTOR: What's the line doing?
ROSE: It's all right. It's holding!
JACKIE: You even look like him?
ROSE: How do you mean? I suppose I do, yeah.
JACKIE: You've changed so much.
ROSE: For the better.
JACKIE: I suppose.
ROSE: Mum, I used to work in a shop.
JACKIE: I've worked in shops. What's wrong with that?
ROSE: No, I didn't mean that.
JACKIE: I know what you meant. What happens when I'm gone?
ROSE: Don't talk like that.
JACKIE: No, but really. When I'm dead and buried, you won't have any reason to come back home. What happens then?
ROSE: I don't know.
JACKIE: Do you think you'll ever settle down?
ROSE: The Doctor never will, so I can't. I'll just keep on travelling.
JACKIE: And you'll keep on changing. And in forty years time, fifty, there'll be this woman, this strange woman, walking through the marketplace on some planet a billion miles from Earth. But she's not Rose Tyler. Not anymore. She's not even human.
DOCTOR : Here we go!
ROSE: The scanner's working. It says delta one six.
DOCTOR: Come on then, you beauty!
YVONNE: And we're into Ghost Shift.
COMPUTER: Online.
YVONNE: What've we got?
MATT: Something's interfering with the ghost field.
YVONNE: Location?
MATT: It's close. It's within the city.
DOCTOR: Don't like that much, do you? Who are you? Where are you coming from? Whoa!
DOCTOR: That's more like it! Not so friendly now, are you?
YVONNE: Close it down. Close it down!
COMPUTER: Offline.
MATT: It was a very specific excitation of the ghost field, and that makes it easy to pinpoint. Almost there South London. South East fifteen. It's a council estate. The Powell Estate. SU15 7GO. It was a public area.
YVONNE: Can we patch into the CCTV network?
MATT: Doing it now.
MATT: Here we go. We've got a camera within fifty yards.
YVONNE: Oh, my God.
MATT: Is it him?
YVONNE: It's him.
DOCTOR: I said so! Those ghosts have been forced into existence from one specific point, and I can track down the source. Allons y!
YVONNE: He's coming.
YVONNE: Rajesh. It's him!
RAJESH: Now we've got you.
DOCTOR: I like that. Allons y. I should say allons y more often. Allons y. Watch out, Rose Tyler. Allons y. And then, it would be really brilliant if I met someone called Alonso, because then I could say, allons y, Alonso, every time. You're staring at me.
ROSE: My mum's still on board.
JACKIE: If we end up on Mars, I'm going to kill you.
DOCTOR: Oh well there goes the advantage of surprise. Still, cuts to the chase. Stay in here, look after Jackie.
ROSE: I'm not looking after my mum.
DOCTOR: Well, you brought her.
JACKIE: I was kidnapped!
ROSE: Doctor, they've got guns.
DOCTOR: And I haven't. Which makes me the better person, don't you think? They can shoot me dead, but the moral high ground is mine.
YVONNE: Oh! Oh, how marvellous. Oh, very good. Superb. Happy day.
DOCTOR: Er, thanks. Nice to meet you. I'm the Doctor.
YVONNE: Oh, I should say. Hurray!
DOCTOR: You, you've heard of me, then?
YVONNE: Well of course we have. And I have to say, if it wasn't for you, none of us would be here. The Doctor and the Tardis.
DOCTOR: And you are?
YVONNE: Oh, plenty of time for that. But according to the records, you're not one for travelling alone. The Doctor and his companion. That's a pattern, isn't it, right? There's no point hiding anything. Not from us. So where is she?
DOCTOR: Yes. Sorry. Good point. She's just a bit shy, that's all.
DOCTOR: But here she is, Rose Tyler.
DOCTOR: Hmm. She's not the best I've ever had. Bit too blonde. Not too steady on her pins. A lot of that.
DOCTOR: And just last week, she stared into the heart of the Time Vortex and aged fifty seven years. But she'll do.
JACKIE: I'm forty.
DOCTOR: Deluded. Bless. I'll have to trade her in. Do you need anyone? She's very good at tea. Well, I say very good, I mean not bad. Well, I say not bad. Anyway, lead on. Allons y. But not too fast. Her ankle's going.
JACKIE:  I'll show you where my ankle's going.
YVONNE: It was only a matter of time until you found us, and at last you've made it. I'd like to welcome you, Doctor. Welcome to Torchwood.
DOCTOR: That's a Jathar Sunglider.
YVONNE: Came down to Earth off the Shetland Islands ten years ago.
DOCTOR: What, did it crash?
YVONNE: No, we shot it down. It violated our airspace. Then we stripped it bare. The weapon that destroyed the Sycorax on Christmas Day? That was us. Now, if you'd like to come with me. The Torchwood Institute has a motto. If it's alien, it's ours. Anything that comes from the sky, we strip it down and we use it for the good of the British Empire.
JACKIE: For the good of the what?
YVONNE: The British Empire.
JACKIE: There isn't a British Empire.
YVONNE: Not yet. Ah, excuse me. Now, if you wouldn't mind.
YVONNE: Do you recognise this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's a particle gun.
YVONNE: Good, isn't it? Took us eight years to get it to work .
DOCTOR: It's the twenty first century. You can't have particle guns.
YVONNE: We must defend our border against the alien. Thank you, Sebastian, isn't it?
SEBASTIAN: Yes, Ma'am.
YVONNE: Thank you, Sebastian. I think it's very important to know everyone by name. Torchwood is a very modern organisation. People skills. That's what it's all about these days. I'm a people person.
DOCTOR: Have you got anyone called Alonso?
YVONNE: No, I don't think so. Is that important?
DOCTOR: No, I suppose not. What was your name?
YVONNE: Yvonne. Yvonne Hartman.
YVONNE: Ah, yes. Now, we're rather fond of these. The Magnaclamp. Found in a spaceship buried at the base of Mount Snowdon. Attach this to an object and it cancels the mass. I could use it to lift two tonnes of weight with a single hand. That's an imperial ton, by the way. Torchwood refuses to go metric.
JACKIE: I could do with that to carry the shopping.
YVONNE: All these devices are for Torchwood's benefit, not the general public's.
DOCTOR: So, what about these ghosts?
YVONNE: Ah yes, the ghosts. They're er what you might call a side effect.
DOCTOR: Of what?
YVONNE: All in good time, Doctor. There is an itinerary, trust me.
JACKIE: Oi! Where are you taking that?
YVONNE: If it's alien, it's ours.
DOCTOR: You'll never get inside it.
YVONNE: Hmm! Et cetera.
ROSE: Psychic paper, psychic paper.
ADEOLA : Hey Matt. Want to see something good?"
MATT:  What?
ADEOLA : Come and see.
DOCTOR: All those times I've been on Earth, I've never heard of you.
YVONNE: But of course not. You're the enemy. You're actually named in the Torchwood Foundation Charter of 1879 as an enemy of the Crown.
DOCTOR: 1879. That was called Torchwood, that house in Scotland.
YVONNE: That's right. Where you encountered Queen Victoria and the werewolf.
JACKIE: I think he makes half of it up.
YVONNE: Her Majesty created the Torchwood Institute with the express intention of keeping Britain great, and fighting the alien horde.
DOCTOR: But if I'm the enemy, does that mean that I'm a prisoner?
YVONNE: Oh yes. But we'll make you perfectly comfortable. And there is so much you can teach us. Starting with this.
YVONNE: Now, what do you make of that?
RAJESH: You must be the Doctor. Rajesh Singh. It's an honour, sir.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
JACKIE: What is that thing?
YVONNE: We got no idea.
JACKIE: But what's wrong with it?
RAJESH: What makes you think there's something wrong with it?
JACKIE: I don't know. It just feels weird.
YVONNE: Well, the sphere has that effect on everyone. Makes you want to run and hide, like it's forbidden.
RAJESH: We tried analysing it using every device imaginable.
RAJESH: But according to our instruments, the sphere doesn't exist. It weighs nothing, it doesn't age. No heat, no radiation, and has no atomic mass.
JACKIE: But I can see it.
RAJESH: Fascinating, isn't it? It upsets people because it gives off nothing. It is absent.
YVONNE: Well, Doctor?
DOCTOR: This is a Void Ship.
YVONNE: And what is that?
DOCTOR: Well, it's impossible for starters. I always thought it was just a theory, but it's a vessel designed to exist outside time and space, travelling through the Void.
RAJESH: And what's the Void?
DOCTOR: The space between dimensions. There's all sorts of realities around us, different dimensions, billions of parallel universes all stacked up against each other. The Void is the space in between, containing absolutely nothing. Imagine that. Nothing. No light, no dark, no up, no down, no life, no time. Without end. My people called it the Void. The Eternals call it the Howling. But some people call it Hell.
RAJESH: But someone built the sphere. What for? Why go there?
DOCTOR: To explore? To escape? You could sit inside that thing and eternity would pass you by. The Big Bang, end of the Universe, start of the next, wouldn't even touch the sides. You'd exist outside the whole of creation.
YVONNE: You see, we were right. There is something inside it.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.
RAJESH: So how do we get in there?
DOCTOR: We don't! We send that thing back into Hell. How did it get here in the first place?
YVONNE: Well, that's how it all started. The sphere came through into this world, and the ghosts followed in its wake.
DOCTOR: Show me.
YVONNE: No, Doctor.
MATT: I don't get it. What is it? What am I supposed to be looking for?
ADEOLA: Just go to the left.
MATT: Yvonne's going to be back any minute.
ADEOLA: Just go to the left.
MATT: What, you mean in here?
YVONNE: The sphere came through here. A hole in the world. Not active at the moment, but when we fire particle engines at that exact spot, the breech opens up.
DOCTOR: How did you even find it?
YVONNE: We were getting warning signs for years. A radar black spot. So we built this place, Torchwood Tower. The breech was six hundred foot above sea level. It was on the only way to reach it.
DOCTOR: You built a skyscraper just to reach a spatial disturbance? How much money have you got?
YVONNE: Enough.
JACKIE: Hold on a minute. We're in Canary Wharf. Must be. This building, it's Canary Wharf.
YVONNE: Well, that is the public name for it. But to those in the know, it's Torchwood.
DOCTOR: So, you find the breach, probe it, the sphere comes through six hundred feet above London, bam. It leaves a hole in the fabric of reality. And that hole, you think, oh, shall we leave it alone? Shall we back off? Shall we play it safe? Nah, you think let's make it bigger!
YVONNE: It's a massive source of energy. If we can harness that power, we need never depend on the Middle East again. Britain will become truly independent. Look, you can see for yourself. Next Ghost Shift's in two minutes.
DOCTOR: Cancel it.
YVONNE: I don't think so.
DOCTOR: I'm warning you, cancel it.
YVONNE: Oh, exactly as the legends would have it. The Doctor, lording it over us. Assuming alien authority over the Rights of Man.
DOCTOR: Let me show you. Sphere comes through.
DOCTOR: But when it made the hole, it cracked the world around it. The entire surface of this dimension splintered. And that's how the ghosts get through. That's how they get everywhere. They're bleeding through the fault lines. Walking from their world, across the Void, and into yours, with the human race hoping and wishing and helping them along. But too many ghosts, and
YVONNE: Well, in that case we'll have to be more careful. Positions! Ghost Shift in one minute.
DOCTOR: Miss Hartman, I am asking you, please don't do it.
YVONNE: We have done this a thousand times.
DOCTOR: Then stop at a thousand!
YVONNE: We're in control of the ghosts. The levers can open the breach, but equally they can close it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
YVONNE: Sorry?
DOCTOR: Never mind. As you were.
YVONNE: What, is that it?
DOCTOR: No, fair enough. Said my bit. Don't mind me. Any chance of a cup of tea?
ADEOLA: Ghost Shift in twenty seconds.
DOCTOR: Mmm, can't wait to see it.
YVONNE You can't stop us, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. Pull up a chair, Rose. Come and watch the fireworks.
ADEOLA: Ghost Shift in ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two
YVONNE: Stop the shift. I said stop.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
YVONNE: I suppose it makes sense to get as much intelligence as possible. But the programme will recommence, as soon as you've explained everything.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to be of help.
YVONNE: And someone clear up this glass. They did warn me, Doctor. They said you like to make a mess.
RAJESH: Can I help you?
ROSE: I was just
RAJESH: Try not to look. It does that to everyone. What do you want?
ROSE: Sorry. They sent me from personnel. They said some man had been taken prisoner. Some sort of Doctor? I'm just checking the lines of communication. Did they tell you anything?
RAJESH: Can I see your authorisation?
ROSE: Sure.
RAJESH: That's lucky. You see, everyone at Torchwood has at least a basic level of psychic training. This paper is blank, and you're a fake. Seal the room. Call security. Samuel, can you check the door locks? She just walked right in.
MICKEY: Doing it now, sir.
RAJESH: Well, if you'd like to take a seat.
YVONNE: So these ghosts, whatever they are, did they build the sphere?
DOCTOR: Must have. Aimed it at this dimension like a cannon ball.
RAJESH : Yvonne? I think you should see this. We've got a visitor. We don't know who she is, but funnily enough, she arrived at the same time as the Doctor.
YVONNE: She one of yours?
DOCTOR: Never seen her before in my life.
YVONNE: Good. Then we can have her shot.
DOCTOR: Oh, all right then. It was worth a try. That's, that's Rose Tyler.
ROSE : Sorry. Hello.
YVONNE: Well, if that's Rose Tyler, who's she?
JACKIE: I'm her mother.
YVONNE: Oh, you travel with her mother?
JACKIE: He kidnapped me.
DOCTOR: Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother.
JACKIE: Charming.
DOCTOR: I've got a reputation to uphold.
YVONNE: Excuse me? Everyone? I thought I said stop the ghost shift. Who started the programme? But I ordered you to stop! Who's doing that?
YVONNE: Right, step away from the monitors, everyone. Gareth, Addy, stop what you're doing, right now. Matt, step away from your desk. That's an order! Stop the levers! Andrew!
YVONNE: Stop the levers!
DOCTOR: What's she doing?
YVONNE: Addy, step away from the desk. Listen to me. Step away from the desk.
DOCTOR: She can't hear you. They're overriding the system. We're going into Ghost Shift.
RAJESH: Yvonne, I thought you said the next Ghost Shift was cancelled. What's going on? Yvonne?
RAJESH: It can't be. It's active!
DOCTOR: It's the ear piece. It's controlling them. I've seen this before. Sorry. I'm so sorry.
YVONNE: What happened? What did you just do?
DOCTOR: They're dead.
JACKIE: You killed them.
DOCTOR: Oh, someone else did that long before I got here.
JACKIE: But you killed them!
DOCTOR: Jackie, I haven't got time for this.
YVONNE: What are those ear pieces?
DOCTOR: Don't.
YVONNE: But they're standard comms. devices. How does it control them?
DOCTOR: Trust me, leave them alone.
YVONNE: But what are they?
YVONNE: Urgh! Oh, God! It goes inside their brain.
DOCTOR: What about the Ghost Shift?
YVONNE: Ninety percent there and still running. Can't you stop it?
DOCTOR: They're still controlling it. They've hi-jacked the system.
YVONNE: Who's they?
DOCTOR: It might be a remote transmitter but it's got to be close by. I can trace it. Jackie, stay here!
YVONNE: Keep those levers down. Keep them offline.
RAJESH: We've got a problem down here. Yvonne, can you hear me?
RAJESH: Yvonne, for God's sake. The sphere is active! The readings are going wild! It's got weight, it's got mass, an electromagnetic field. It exists!
RAJESH: The door's sealed. Automatic quarantine. We can't get out!
MICKEY: It's all right, babe. We've beaten them before, we can beat them again. That's why I'm here. The fight goes on.
ROSE: The fight against what?
MICKEY: What do you think?
YVONNE: You two. You come with us.
SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am.
DOCTOR: What's down here?
YVONNE: I don't, I don't know. I think it's building work. It's just renovations.
DOCTOR: You should go back.
YVONNE: Think again.
YVONNE: What is it? What's down here?
DOCTOR: Ear pieces, ear pods. This world's colliding with another, and I think I know which one.
YVONNE: What are they?
DOCTOR: They came through first. The advance guard.
DOCTOR: Cybermen!
MICKEY: We had them beaten, but then they escaped. The Cybermen just vanished. They found a way through to this world, but so did we.
ROSE: The Doctor said that was impossible.
MICKEY: Yeah, it's not the first time he's been wrong.
ROSE: What's inside that sphere?
MICKEY: No one knows. Cyber Leader, Cyber King, Emperor of the Cybermen. Whatever it is, he's dead meat.
ROSE: It's good to see you.
MICKEY: Yeah. It's good to see you too.
DOCTOR: Get away from the machines. Do what they say. Don't fight them!
JACKIE: What are they?
CYBERMAN: We are the Cybermen. The Ghost Shift will be increased to one hundred percent.
COMPUTER: Online.
DOCTOR: Here come the ghosts.
ALISTAIR APPLETON : It's extraordinary, there are more ghosts than we've ever seen before, and it's happening all over the world.
POLICE COMMANDER : As far as we know, the increase in ghost activity is harmless.
RAJESH: Can anyone hear me? Come on, I need help down here! I need
MICKEY: Here we go.
JACKIE: But these Cybermen, what've they got to do with the ghosts?
DOCTOR: Do you never listen? A footprint doesn't look like a boot.
CYBERLEADER: Achieving full transfer.
DOCTOR: They're Cybermen. All of the ghosts are Cybermen. Millions of them, right across the world.
PRESENTER: They're not ghosts! They're metal men
POLICE COMMANDER : I urge you, stay in your homes!
YVONNE: They're invading the whole planet.
DOCTOR: It's not an invasion. It's too late for that. It's a victory.
COMPUTER: Sphere activated. Sphere activated. Sphere activated. Sphere activated.
MICKEY: I know what's in there, and I'm ready for them. I've got just the thing.
MICKEY: This is going to blast them to Hell.
RAJESH: Samuel, what are you doing?
MICKEY: The name's Mickey. Mickey Smith. Defending the Earth.
DOCTOR: But I don't understand. The Cybermen don't have the technology to build a Void Ship. That's way beyond you. How did you create that sphere?
CYBERMAN: The sphere is not ours.
DOCTOR: What?
CYBERMAN: The sphere broke down the barriers between worlds. We only followed. Its origin is unknown.
DOCTOR: Then what's inside it?
JACKIE: Rose is down there.
MICKEY: That's not Cybermen.
ROSE: Oh, my God.
BLACK DALEK: Location, Earth. Life forms detected. Exterminate!
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
