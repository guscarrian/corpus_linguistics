The Bells of Saint John
Prequel 
GIRL: Hello.
DOCTOR: Hello.
GIRL: Why are you sitting on a swing?
DOCTOR: Why shouldn't I?
GIRL: Because you're old.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true. That is very true.
GIRL: My mum says I shouldn't talk to strange men.
DOCTOR: Ah, you mum's right.
GIRL: Are you strange?
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. I'm way past strange. I think I'm probably incredible.
GIRL: Are you lonely?
DOCTOR: Why would I be lonely?
GIRL: Because you're sad. Have you lost something?
DOCTOR: No.
GIRL: When I lose something, I go to a quiet place and I close my eyes, and then I can remember where I put it.
DOCTOR: Good plan.
GIRL: I'm always losing things. I lost my best pencil, my schoolbag, and my gran, and my mojo.
DOCTOR: Your mojo?
GIRL: I got it back, though.
DOCTOR: Hey, that's good.
GIRL: What did you lose?
DOCTOR: My friend. I met her twice before and I lost her both times, and now I don't think I'll ever find her again.
GIRL: Have you been looking?
DOCTOR: Yeah, everywhere.
GIRL: That's sad.
DOCTOR: It is a bit. Hey, is that your mum?
GIRL: Yeah, I'd better go and see if she's all right.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I think you better had.
GIRL: How are you going to find her?
DOCTOR: Well, the first two times I met her, I just sort of bumped into her, so I thought maybe if I just wandered about a bit, I might bump into her again. You know, like destiny, sort of.
GIRL: That's rubbish.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I think it probably is. Hey, maybe I could find a quiet room and have a good think about it instead.
GIRL: That would be better. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
GIRL: Mister, I hope you find her again.
DOCTOR: So do I.
MUM: Who was that?
GIRL: I was talking to a sad man.
MUM: Look, Clara Oswald, what have I told you about talking to strange men?
NABILE: Danger. This is a warning. A warning to the whole world. You're looking for wifi. Sometimes you see something.
NABILE: A bit like this. Don't click it. Do not click it. Once you've clicked it, they're in your computer.
NABILE: They can see you. And they can see you, they might choose you. And if they do, you die. For twenty four hours, you're dead. For a while. People's souls are being uploaded to the internet. And some people get stuck. Their minds, their souls, in the wifi. Like echoes, like ghosts. Sometimes you can hear their screams on the radio, on the telly, on the net. This is real. This is not a hoax.
MAN 2 : I don't know where I am.
NABILE: Or a joke.
NABILE: Or a story.
MAN 3 : I don't know where I am.
NABILE: This is real, and I know that, because I don't know where I am. Please, please, if you can hear me, if you can hear me, I don't know where I am.
MONK: Wake the Abbott. The bells of Saint John are ringing.
ABBOTT: We must go to him.
MONK: They call him the mad monk, don't they.
ABBOTT: They shouldn't. He's definitely not a monk.
ABBOTT: Ahem. I'm sorry to intrude, but the bells of Saint John are ringing.
DOCTOR: I'm going to need a horse.
MONK: Is that her?
ABBOTT: The woman twice dead, and her final message. He was drawn to this place of peace and solitude that he might divine her meaning. If he truly is mad, then this is his madness.
CLARA: Angie? Is the internet working? Trying to phone the helpline, they won't answer.
ANGIE: It's working for me.
CLARA: Can I use it when you're finished?
ANGIE: More than one person can use the internet at a time, Clara.
CLARA: You done your homework?
ANGIE: Shut up, you're not my mum.
CLARA: And I'm not trying to be, okay?
GEORGE: Right. Yes. Angie's probably fine on her own. You can probably have the night off.
CLARA: I'm okay. I'll be upstairs when I figure out my computer.
GEORGE: Anyway, the adverts are in, so hopefully we'll find someone.
CLARA: I'm here as long as you need me.
GEORGE: Good. Right, come along, Artie. Time to go.
CLARA: What chapter are you on?
ARTIE: Ten.
CLARA: Eleven is the best. You'll cry your eyes out.
FATHER : Artie!
CLARA: Oh, come on! Just answer. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.
DOCTOR: That is not supposed to happen.
DOCTOR: Hello?
CLARA: Ah, hello. I can't find the internet.
DOCTOR: Sorry?
CLARA : It's gone, the internet.
CLARA: Can't find it anywhere. Where is it?
DOCTOR: The internet?
CLARA : Yes, the internet.
CLARA: Why don't I have the internet?
DOCTOR: It's twelve oh seven.
CLARA: I've got half past three. Am I phoning a different time zone?
DOCTOR: Yeah, you really sort of are.
CLARA : Will it show up on the bill?
DOCTOR: Oh, I dread to think. Listen, where did you get this number?
CLARA : The woman in the shop wrote it down.
CLARA: It's a help line, isn't it? She said it's the best help line out there.
CLARA : In the universe, she said.
DOCTOR: What woman? Who was she?
CLARA : I don't know. The woman in the shop. So
CLARA: Why isn't there internet? Shouldn't it sort of
CLARA : Be there?
DOCTOR: Look, listen, I'm not actually, it isn't. You have clicked on the wifi button, yeah?
CLARA: Hang on. Wifi.
DOCTOR : Click on the wifi, you'll see a list of names. You see one you recognise.
CLARA: It's asking me for a password.
ANGIE: Is it okay if I go and see Nina? You can call her mum.
CLARA: Sure. What's the password for the internet?
ANGIE: R Y C B A R 1 2 3.
CLARA: How am I supposed to remember that?
MONK: Is it an evil spirit?
DOCTOR: A woman.
CLARA : Hang on.
CLARA: A mo. Run you clever boy and remember one two three
DOCTOR: What did you say?
CLARA: Don't shout. Now you've made me type it wrong. It's thrown me out again. What do I do? How do I get back in?
CLARA : It's just a thing to remember the password, run you clever boy and remember. Hang on.
CLARA: Hello? Yes, I hear you.
CLARA: Yep. Ah ha.
CLARA: Hello.
DOCTOR: Clara. Clara Oswald.
CLARA: Hello.
DOCTOR: Clara Oswin Oswald.
CLARA: Just Clara Oswald. What was that middle one?
DOCTOR: Do you remember me?
CLARA: No. Should I? Who are you?
DOCTOR: The Doctor. No? The Doctor?
CLARA: Doctor who?
DOCTOR: No, just the Doctor. Actually, sorry, could you start all that again?
CLARA: Could I what?
DOCTOR: Could you just ask me that question again?
CLARA: Doctor who?
DOCTOR: Okay, just once more.
CLARA: Doctor who?
DOCTOR: Ooo, yeah. Ooo. Do you know, I never realised how much I enjoy hearing that said out loud. Thank you.
CLARA: Okay.
DOCTOR: Hey, no, Clara, please. Clara, I need to talk to you. Listen. Please.
ALEXEI: Clara Oswald. We've got a positive lock on her, but I think she's borderline. Very clever but no computer skills.
KIZLET: Upload her anyway. Splice her a computer skills package.
ALEXEI: I'll activate a spoonhead.
KIZLET: Alexei, we call them servers, not spoonheads.
ALEXEI: Sorry. Excuse me.
KIZLET: I'm ever so fond of Alexei, but my conscience says we should probably kill him.
MAHLER: I'll inform HR.
KIZLET: Actually, he's about to go on holiday. Kill him when he gets back. Let's not be unreasonable.
KIZLET: Didn't you want to speak to me?
MAHLER: We're uploading too many people too quickly. We're going to get noticed.
KIZLET: If your conscience is bothering you, think of it like this. We're preserving living minds in permanent form in the data cloud. It's like immortality, only fatal.
MAHLER: My conscience is fine.
KIZLET: Good. Because our client has his needs.
MAHLER: Did you just hack me?
KIZLET: Because you changed your mind?
MAHLER: I hope I did.
DOCTOR: Please, I just need to speak to you.
CLARA: Why are you still here? Why are you here at all?
DOCTOR : Oi, you phoned me. You were looking for the internet.
CLARA: That was you?
DOCTOR: Of course it was me.
CLARA : How did you get here so fast?
DOCTOR : I just happened to be in the neighbourhood, on my mobile phone.
CLARA: When you say mobile phone, why do you point at that blue box?
DOCTOR : Because it's a surprisingly accurate description.
CLARA: Okay, we're finished now.
DOCTOR : Oi, no, don't.
CLARA: Angie? Angie, you upstairs? Angie, you still here?
CLARA: Hello.
GIRL: Hello.
CLARA: Are you a friend of Angie's?
GIRL: I'm a friend of Angie's.
CLARA: What were you doing upstairs?
GIRL: I was upstairs.
CLARA: I know you, don't I?
GIRL: You know me, don't you.
DOCTOR: Right. Don't be a monk. Monks are not cool.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Clara! Clara?
CLARA : Hello?
DOCTOR: Ah, see? Look, it's me. De-monked. Sensible clothes. Can I come in now?
CLARA : I don't understand.
DOCTOR: You just open the door.
CLARA : I don't know.
DOCTOR: Of course you can.
CLARA : Where I am. I don't know where I am. Where am I? Please tell me where I am. I don't know where I am.
CLARA : I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am!
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara?
CLARA : I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am. I don't understand. I don't know where I am! I don't understand. I don't know where I am.
CLARA : Where am I? I don't know where I am.
ALEXEI: I've got a problem.
DOCTOR: Walking base station. Walking wifi base station. Hoovering up data. Hoovering up people.
DOCTOR: Oh no, you don't.
DOCTOR: Oh no, you don't.
ALEXEI: Looks like someone is trying to reverse an upload.
KIZLET: Is that possible?
MAHLER: The upload isn't fully integrated yet. In theory, yes.
ALEXEI: Oh, my god.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not this time, Clara, I promise.
MAHLER: Can you stop this?
ALEXEI: No.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're fine. You're back. Yes, you are. Oh yes, you are.
KIZLET: Well?
MAHLER: Our hacker sent a message.
MAHLER: I assume he's talking about the girl.
KIZLET: Get out. I have to speak to the client.
KIZLET: Sir. The one you told me about, he's here. The Doctor is here.
CLARA: Hello?
DOCTOR: Hello! Are you all right?
CLARA: I'm in bed.
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: Don't remember going.
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: What did I miss?
DOCTOR: Oh, quite a lot, actually. Angie called. She's going to stay over at Nina's. Apparently that's all completely fine and you shouldn't worry like you always do. For god's sake get off her back. Also, your dad phoned, mainly about the government. He seems very cross with them, I've got several pages on that. I said I'd look into it. I fixed that rattling noise in the washing machine, indexed the kitchen cupboards, optimised photosynthesis in the main flower bed and assembled a quadricycle.
CLARA: Assembled a what?
DOCTOR: I found a disassembled quadricycle in the garage.
CLARA: I don't think you did.
DOCTOR: I invented the quadricycle. Ha!
CLARA: What happened to me?
DOCTOR: Don't you remember?
CLARA: I was scared, really scared. Didn't know where I was.
DOCTOR: Do you know now?
CLARA: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well then, you should go to sleep. Because you're safe now, I promise. Goodnight, Clara.
CLARA: Are you guarding me?
DOCTOR: Well, yes. Yes, I am.
CLARA: Are you seriously going to sit down there all night?
DOCTOR: I promise I won't budge from this spot.
CLARA: Well then, I'll have to come to you.
DOCTOR: Eh?
KIZLET: I take it the girl's inside, and alive?
ALEXEI: Yes.
KIZLET: Alexei, I need you to do something creative about that.
DOCTOR: I like your house.
CLARA: It isn't mine. I'm a friend of the family.
DOCTOR: But you look after the kids. Oh yes, you're a governess, aren't you, just like
CLARA: Just like what?
DOCTOR: Just like. I thought you probably would be.
CLARA: Are you going to explain what happened to me?
DOCTOR: There's something in the wifi.
CLARA: Okay.
DOCTOR: This whole world is swimming in wifi. We're living in a wifi soup. Suppose something got inside it. Suppose there was something living in the wifi, harvesting human minds. Extracting them. Imagine that. Human souls trapped like flies in the world-wide web. Stuck forever, crying out for help.
CLARA: Isn't that basically Twitter?
CLARA: What's that face for?
DOCTOR: A computer can hack another computer. A living, sentient computer, maybe that could hack people. Edit them. Re-write them.
CLARA: Why would you say that?
DOCTOR: Because a few hours ago you knew nothing about the internet, and you just made a joke about Twitter.
CLARA: Oh. Oh, that's weird. I know all about computers now in my head. Where did all that come from?
DOCTOR: You were uploaded for a while. Wherever you were, you brought something extra back, which I very much doubt you'll be allowed to keep.
DOCTOR: You and me inside that box, now.
CLARA: I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: Look, just get inside.
CLARA: Both of us?
DOCTOR: Oh, trust me. You'll understand once we're in there.
CLARA: I bet I will. What is that box, anyway? Why have you got a box? Is it like a snogging booth?
DOCTOR: Clara. A what?
CLARA: Is that what you do, bring a booth? There is such a thing as too keen.
DOCTOR: Clara, look around you.
CLARA: What's going on? What's happening? Is the wifi switching on the lights?
DOCTOR: No, people are switching on the lights. The wifi is switching on the people.
CLARA: What is that thing?
DOCTOR: A walking base station. You saw one earlier.
CLARA: I saw a little girl.
DOCTOR: It must have taken an image from your subconscious, thrown it back at you. Ah! Active camouflage. They could be everywhere.
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor.
CLARA: What's going on?
MAHLER: Do we need another London-wide activation? We can't always pass it off as a riot.
CLARA: Our lights are on and everyone else's off. Why?
DOCTOR: Some planes have wifi.
CLARA: I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: We must be one hell of a target right now.
DOCTOR: You, me, box, right now.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a spaceship. Yes, it's bigger on the inside. Now, I don't have time to talk about it.
CLARA: But, but, but, but it's
DOCTOR: Shut up, please. Short hops are difficult.
CLARA: Bigger on the inside. Actually bigger.
DOCTOR: Right, come on.
CLARA: We're going to go back out there?
DOCTOR: We've moved. It's a spaceship. We flew away.
CLARA: Away from the plane?
DOCTOR: Not exactly.
CLARA: How did we get here?
DOCTOR: It's a ship. I told you. It's all very sciency.
CLARA: This is the plane? The actual plane? Are they all dead?
DOCTOR: Asleep. Switched off by the wifi. Never mind them.
CLARA: What is going on? Is this real? Please, tell me what is happening!
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'm an alien from outer space. I'm a thousand years old, I've got two hearts and I can't fly a plane! Can you?
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: Oh, fine. Let's do it together.
DOCTOR: Whoo! Would a victory roll be too showy offy?
PILOT: What the hell's going on?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm blocking your wifi so you're waking up, for a start. Tell you what, do you want to drive?
KIZLET: I don't understand. That box, where's it gone? Find that box!
CLARA: Okay. When are you going to explain to me what the hell is going on?
DOCTOR: Breakfast.
CLARA: What? I ain't waiting till breakfast.
DOCTOR: It's a time machine. You never have to wait for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Thank you, thank you. Yes, magic blue box.
DOCTOR: All donations gratefully accepted. Roll up, give us your dosh. Pennies, pounds, anything you've got.
DOCTOR: Keep collecting. We need enough for breakfast. Just popping back to the garage.
CLARA: Garage?
DOCTOR: This way.
CLARA: So this is tomorrow, then. Tomorrow's come early.
DOCTOR: No, it came at the usual time. We just took a short cut. Thank you, thank you. Tomorrow, a camel.
MAHLER: What's happening?
ALEXEI: Blue box, South bank. Definitely wasn't there five minutes ago.
MAHLER: Are we sure this time? Earl's Court was an embarrassment.
CLARA: If you've got a flying time machine, why are we on a motorbike?
DOCTOR: I don't take the Tardis into battle.
CLARA: Because it's made of wood?
DOCTOR: Because it's the most powerful ship in the universe and I don't want it falling into the wrong hands. Okay?
KIZLET: I do love London. So many cameras.
CLARA: So if we can travel anywhere in time and space, why did we travel to the morning. What's the point in that?
DOCTOR: Whoever's after us spent the whole night looking for us. Are you tired?
CLARA: Yes.
DOCTOR: What? Then imagine how they feel. They came the long way round. They've got to be close. Definitely London going by the signal distribution. I can hack the lowest level of their operating system but I can't establish a physical location. The security's too good.
CLARA: Are you an alien?
DOCTOR: I am. Yes, okay with that?
CLARA: Oh, yeah. Think I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Oh, good.
CLARA: So, what happens if you do find them? What happens then?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I can't tell the future, I just work there.
CLARA: You don't have a plan?
DOCTOR: Oh, you know what I always say about plans.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: I don't have one.
CLARA: People always have plans.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I suppose they do. So tell me, how long have you been looking after those kids?
CLARA: About a year, since their mum died.
DOCTOR: Okay. Why you? Family friend, I get that, but there must have been others. Why did it have to be you? You don't really seem like a nanny.
CLARA: Gimme.
DOCTOR: Sorry. What?
CLARA: You need to know where they physically are. Their exact location.
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARA: I can do it.
DOCTOR: Oi, hang on. I need that.
CLARA: You've hacked the lower operating system, yeah? I'll have their physical location in under five minutes. Pop off and get us a coffee.
DOCTOR: If I can't find them, you definitely can't.
CLARA: They uploaded me, remember? I've got computing stuff in my head.
DOCTOR: So do I.
CLARA: I have insane hacking skills.
DOCTOR: I'm from space and the future with two hearts and twenty seven brains.
CLARA: And I can find them in under five minutes plus photographs. Twenty seven?
DOCTOR: Okay, slight exaggeration.
CLARA: Coffee, go get. Five minutes, I promise.
DOCTOR: The security is absolute.
CLARA: It's never about the security, it's about the people.
CLARA: Why do you keep looking at me like that?
DOCTOR: Sorry, no, it's nothing. It's just, you're a nanny. Isn't that a bit, well, Victorian?
CLARA: Victorian?
DOCTOR: You're young. Shouldn't you be doing, you know, young things, with young people?
CLARA: You mean like you, for instance? Down, boy.
DOCTOR: No. No. I didn't. Shut up.
DOCTOR: Two more cappuccinos over there, please.
BARISTA: One moment, sir.
BARISTA: You realise you haven't the slightest chance of saving your little friend.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, what?
BARISTA: One moment, sir. I said, there's not the slightest chance of saving your little friend. And don't annoy the old man. He isn't, in fact, speaking.
WAITRESS: I'm speaking. Just using whatever's to hand.
KIZLET: Oh, she's rather pretty, isn't she? Do you like her?
WAITRESS: Make her like you, too, if you want.  You all right, sir?
DOCTOR: Er, yes. Yes. Fine.
DOCTOR: You okay?
CLARA: Sure. Setting up stuff. Need a user name.
DOCTOR: Learning fast.
CLARA: Clara Oswald for the win. Oswin!
CLARA : You can always call me Oswin, seeing as that's my name.
WAITRESS: Now I want you to take a look around. Go on, have a little stroll.
KIZLET: And see how impossible your situation is.
WAITRESS: Go on, take a look. I do love showing off.
GIRL: Just let me show you what control of the wifi can do for you. Stop!
DOCTOR: I saw what you can do last night.
GIRL: And clear.
WOMAN : We can hack anyone in the wifi once they've been exposed long enough.
DOCTOR: So there's one of your walking base stations here, somewhere close.
KIZLET: There's always someone close. We've released thousands into the world.
WOMAN : They home in on the wifi like rats sniffing cheese.
ALEXEI: There's something up with the webcams.
DOCTOR: I don't know who you are or why you're doing this, but the people of this world will not be harmed. They will not controlled. They will not be
WOMAN : The people of this world are
KIZLET: In no danger whatsoever. My client requires a steady diet of living human minds. Healthy, free-range, human minds. He loves and cares for humanity. In fact, he can't get enough of it.
DOCTOR: It's obscene. It's murder.
WOMAN : It's life.
KIZLET: The farmer tends his flock like a loving parent.
WOMAN : The abattoir is not a contradiction.
KIZLET: No one loves cattle more than Burger King.
ALEXEI: I'm sure of it. Someone's hacking the webcams. All of them.
MAHLER: Everybody check your webcams.
ALEXEI: But what would be the point, taking mug shots of us?
MAHLER: Who's on Facebook?
MAHLER: Bebo? MySpace? Abo?
MAHLER: Put your hands down if you didn't mention where you work.
DOCTOR: This ends. I'm going to end this today.
WOMAN : How? You don't even know
KIZLET: Where we are.
DOCTOR: Who's doing this? Who is your client? Hmm? Answer me.
MAHLER: Miss Kizlet, we have a problem.
CLARA: I did it. I really did. I did it. I did it. I found them.
DOCTOR: You found them.
CLARA: The Shard. They're in the Shard. Floor sixty five.
DOCTOR: Floor sixty five.
CLARA: Are you listening to me, Doctor? I found them.
DOCTOR: I'm listening to you. You found them.
ALEXEI: We've got her. This time we've really got her.
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara?
CLARA : Doctor? Doctor, help me. I, I don't know where I am. I don't understand. Doctor, help me, please. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am! I don't know where I am. Doctor, please. Please help me. Please help me. I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am.
CLARA : Doctor, help me. I don't know where I am.
MAHLER: Should we pulp her or keep her as a hostage?
KIZLET: There's no point. She's fully integrated now. She can't be downloaded again. I'm sure he knows that.
ALEXEI: I'm not sure he does. He's coming.
MAHLER: We could stop him, I suppose.
KIZLET: Why bother? Could be quite funny.
MAN WITH CHIPS: Really, Doctor. A motorbike? Hardly seems like you.
DOCTOR: I rode this in the antigrav Olympics, 2074. I came last.
MAN WITH CHIPS: The building is in lock-down. I'm afraid you're not coming in.
DOCTOR: Did you even hear the word, antigrav?
ALEXEI: Seriously? He can do that? He can really actually do that?
KIZLET: Oh dear lord.
MAHLER: I think that was your office.
KIZLET: Excuse me. I believe there's someone to see me.
KIZLET: Do come in.
DOCTOR: Download her.
KIZLET: Sorry about the draught.
DOCTOR: Download her back into her body right now.
KIZLET: I can't.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can.
KIZLET: She's a fully integrated part of the data cloud, now. She can't be separated.
DOCTOR: Then download the entire cloud. Everyone you've trapped in there.
KIZLET: You realise what would happen?
DOCTOR: Yes, those with bodies to go home to would be free.
KIZLET: A tiny number. Most would simply die.
DOCTOR: They'd be released from a living hell. It's the best you can do for them, so give the order.
KIZLET: And why would I do that?
DOCTOR: Because I'm going to motivate you, any second now.
KIZLET: You ridiculous man. Why did you even come here? Whatever for?
DOCTOR: I didn't.
KIZLET: What?
DOCTOR: I'm still in the cafe.
DOCTOR: I'm finishing my coffee. Lovely spot.
BASE STATION: You hack people, but me?
DOCTOR: I'm old-fashioned.
BASE STATION: I hack technology.
DOCTOR: Here's your motivation.
KIZLET: No, not me! Not me!
KIZLET : Put me back. Put me back! Download me at once! That is an order. That is an order!
ALEXEI: But she's fully integrated now. We'll have to download the entire cloud. We can't do that.
MAHLER: No, we can't.
KIZLET : Download me!
KIZLET : Download me!
MAHLER: Do what she says.
CLARA: Doctor?
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor!
MAHLER: You have no right to be in this office, and I am demanding that you leave at once.
OFFICER: This building is under UNIT control.
MAHLER: What is UNIT? Never heard of you.
OFFICER: Just you calm down, sir.
KIZLET: UNIT are here. Friends of the Doctor, I presume.
GREAT INTELLIGENCE : Oh, old friends. Very old friends.
KIZLET: Then I appear to have failed you, Great Intelligence.
GREAT INTELLIGENCE : I have feasted on many minds. I have grown. But now it is time for you to reduce.
KIZLET: You've been whispering in my ear so long, I'm not sure I remember what I was before.
GREAT INTELLIGENCE : Goodbye, Miss Kizlet.
ALEXEI: Sorry. Where am I? What am I doing here? Are you soldiers? What's happening? How did I get here?
MAHLER: Excuse me, where are the toilets?
ALEXEI: The toilets?
MAHLER: I'm here to fix the toilets, the gents. How long have I been here?
OFFICER: Stay where you are!
OFFICER: Ma'am, identify yourself.
KIZLET: Where are my mummy and daddy? They said they wouldn't be long. Are they coming back?
DOCTOR: Come in.
CLARA: So, he comes back, does he?
DOCTOR: You didn't answer my question.
CLARA: What question?
DOCTOR: You don't seem like a nanny.
CLARA: I was going to travel. I came to stay for a week before I left, and during that week
DOCTOR: She died, so you're returning the favour. You've got a hundred and one places to see, and you haven't been to any of them, have you? That's why you keep the book.
CLARA: I keep the book because I'm still going.
DOCTOR: But you don't run out on the people you care about. Wish I was more like that. You know, the thing about a time machine, you can run away all you like and still be home in time for tea, so what do you say? Anywhere. All of time and space, right outside those doors.
CLARA: Does this work?
DOCTOR: Eh?
CLARA: Is this actually what you do? Do you just crook your finger and people just jump in your snog box and fly away?
DOCTOR: It is not a snog box.
CLARA: I'll be the judge of that.
DOCTOR: Starting when?
CLARA: Come back tomorrow. Ask me again.
DOCTOR: Why?
CLARA: Because tomorrow, I might say yes. Sometime after seven okay for you?
DOCTOR: It's a time machine. Any time's okay.
CLARA: See you then.
DOCTOR: Clara? In your book there was a leaf. Why?
CLARA: That wasn't a leaf. That was page one.
DOCTOR: Right then, Clara Oswald. Time to find out who you are.
