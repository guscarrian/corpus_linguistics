Day of the Moon
CANTON: Suspect directly ahead. Coming to you now. Over.
AMY: Canton.
CANTON: Miss Pond.
AMY: Is that a body bag?
CANTON: Yes, it is.
AMY: It's empty.
CANTON: How about that?
AMY: Do you even know why you're doing this, eh? Can you even remember the warehouse?
DOCTOR: Canton. Amy. Amy!
RORY: River, come on!
DOCTOR: Run!
CANTON: What the hell's going on?
DOCTOR: Look behind you.
CANTON: There's nothing behind me.
DOCTOR: Look. Look. Canton, look, I tell you.
SILENCE: Canton.
TANNOY: All visitors to remain behind the yellow line. All visitors to remain behind the yellow line. 
CANTON: We found Amy Pond. She had strange markings on her arm. Do you know what they are?
DOCTOR: Why don't you ask her?
RIVER: I see you. I see you.
CANTON: Doctor Song? Doctor Song? Go! Go! Go!
CANTON: Don't move! It's over.
RIVER: They're here, Canton. They're everywhere.
CANTON: I know. America's being invaded.
RIVER: You were invaded a long time ago. America is occupied.
CANTON: You're coming with us, Doctor Song. There's no way out this time.
RIVER: There's always a way out.
CANTON: We found Doctor Song.
DOCTOR: These bricks, what are they made of? Where is she?
CANTON: She ran. Off the fiftieth floor.
DOCTOR: I'd say zero balance dwarf star alloy. The densest material in the universe. Nothing gets through that. You're building me the perfect prison. And it still won't be enough.
RORY: What are you waiting for?
CANTON: I'm waiting for you to run. It'd look better if I shot you while you're running. Then again, looks aren't everything.
DOCTOR: Is there a reason you're doing this?
CANTON: I want you to know where you stand.
DOCTOR: In a cell.
CANTON: In the perfect cell. Nothing can penetrate these walls. Not a sound, not a radio wave, not the tiniest particle of anything.
CANTON: In here, you're literally cut off from the rest of the universe. So I guess they can't hear us, right?
DOCTOR: Good work, Canton. Door sealed?
CANTON: You bet.
DOCTOR: Are you okay?
AMY: Finally.
RORY: These things could really do with air holes.
CANTON: Never had a complaint before.
AMY: Isn't it going to look odd that you're staying in here with us?
CANTON: Odd, but not alarming. They know there's no way out of this place.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Whatever they might think we're doing in here, they know we're not going anywhere.
DOCTOR: Shall we?
CANTON: What about Doctor Song?
CANTON: She dove off a rooftop.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. She does that. Amy, Rory, open all the doors to the swimming pool.
DOCTOR: So, we know they're everywhere. Not just a landing party, an occupying force, and they 'have been here a very, very long time. But nobody knows that, because no one can remember them.
CANTON: So what are they up to?
DOCTOR: No idea. But the good news is, we've got a secret weapon.
RIVER: Apollo 11's your secret weapon?
DOCTOR: No, no. It's not Apollo 11. That would be silly. It's Neil Armstrong's foot.
RADIO : In just a few days, mankind will set foot on the Moon for the first time. Today, the President reaffirmed America's commitment
CANTON: Ready. Check.
AMY: Clear.
CANTON: Clear.
CANTON: Ow!
DOCTOR: Ha. So, three months. What have we found out?
RORY: Well, they are everywhere. Every state in America. Ahh.
DOCTOR: Not just America, the entire world.
RIVER: There's a greater concentration here, though.
AMY: Ow!
DOCTOR: Are you okay?
AMY: All better.
DOCTOR: Better?
AMY: Turns out I was wrong. I'm not pregnant.
RORY: What's up?
AMY: Nothing. Really, nothing. Seriously.
CANTON: So you've seen them, but you don't remember them.
RIVER: You've seen them, too. That night at the warehouse, remember? While you were pretending to hunt us down, we saw hundreds of those things. We still don't know what they look like.
RORY: It's like they edit themselves out of your memory as soon as you look away. The exact second you're not looking at them, you can't remember anything.
AMY: Sometimes you feel a bit sick, though, but not always.
CANTON: So that's why you marked your skin.
AMY: Only way we'd know if we'd had an encounter.
CANTON: How long have they been here?
AMY: That's what we've spent the last three months trying to find out.
RORY: Not easy, if you can't remember anything you discover.
CANTON: How long do you think?
DOCTOR: As long as there's been something in the corner of your eye, or creaking in your house, or breathing under your bed, or voices through a wall. They've been running your lives for a very long time now, so keep this straight in your head. We are not fighting an alien invasion, we're leading a revolution. And today, the battle begins.
CANTON: How?
DOCTOR: Like this.
RIVER: Ow!
DOCTOR:  Nanorecorder. Fuses with the cartilage in your hand.  Ow. And it tunes itself directly to the speech centres in your brain. It'll pick up your voice, no matter what. Telepathic connection. So, the moment you see one of the creatures, you activate it, and describe aloud exactly what you're seeing.
DOCTOR: : And describe aloud exactly what you're seeing.
DOCTOR: Because the moment you break contact, you're going to forget it happened. The light will flash if you've left yourself a message. You keep checking your hand if you've had an encounter. That's the first you'll know about it.
CANTON: Why didn't you tell me this before we started?
DOCTOR: I did, but even information about these creatures erases itself over time. I couldn't refresh it because I couldn't talk to you.
CANTON: What? What are you staring at?
RIVER: Look at your hand.
CANTON: Why is it doing that?
DOCTOR: What does it mean if the light's flashing? What did I just tell you?
CANTON: I haven't
DOCTOR: Play it.
CANTON : My God, how did it get in here?
DOCTOR : Keep eye contact with the creature and, when I say, turn back, and when you do, straighten my bow tie.
CANTON : What? What are you staring at?
RIVER : Look at your hand.
DOCTOR: It's a hologram, extrapolated from the photo on Amy's phone. Take a good, long look.
DOCTOR: You just saw an image of one of the creatures we're fighting. Describe it to me.
CANTON: I can't.
DOCTOR: No. Neither can I. You straightened my bow tie because I planted the idea in your head while you were looking at the creature.
AMY: So they could do that to people. You could be doing stuff and not really knowing why you're doing it.
RORY: Like posthypnotic suggestion.
AMY: Ruling the world with posthypnotic suggestion?
DOCTOR: Now then, a little girl in a spacesuit. They got the suit from NASA, but where did they get the girl?
CANTON: It could be anywhere.
DOCTOR: Except they'd probably stay close to that warehouse, because why bother doing anything else? And they'd take her from somewhere that would cause the least amount of attention. But you'll have to find her. I'm off to NASA.
CANTON: Find her? Where do we look?
DOCTOR: Children's homes.
RENFREW: Hello?
CANTON: FBI. You must be Doctor Renfrew. Can we come in?
RENFREW: The children are asleep.
AMY: We'll be very quiet.
RENFREW: Is there a problem?
CANTON: It's about a missing child.
RENFREW: What are you. Yes, come in, please. This way. Please excuse the writing. It keeps happening. I try to clean it up.
AMY: It's the kids, yeah? They did that.
RENFREW: Yes, the children. It must be, yes. Anyway, my office is this way.
CANTON: We nearly didn't come to this place. I understood Graystark Hall was closed in 67.
RENFREW: That's the plan, yes.
AMY: The plan?
RENFREW: Not long now.
CANTON: It's 1969.
RENFREW: No, no. We close in 67. That's the plan, yes.
CANTON: You misunderstood me, sir. It's 1969 now.
RENFREW: Why are you saying that? Of course it isn't.
CANTON: July.
RENFREW: My office is this way. This way.
AMY: I'll check upstairs.
CANTON: Be careful.
DOCTOR: Amy.
AMY: I think we've found the place she was taken from.
DOCTOR: How do you know?
AMY: Because those things have been here. But the whole place is deserted.
AMY: There's just one guy here and I think he's lost it.
DOCTOR: Repeated memory wipes fry your head eventually. Find out what you can, but don't hang around.
AMY: Where are you?
DOCTOR: Got to go. Got company.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, I've put everything back the way I found it. Except this. There's always a bit left over, isn't there?
AMY : I can see them, but I think they're asleep. Get out. Just get out!
She tries the windows then sees the tally marks on her hands, and then the lightning shows her reflection in the glass. There are tally marks on her face, too. The aliens are hanging from the ceiling in a cluster, like bats. She bumps into a bucket and they start to wake. Then the door opens and she forgets it all.)
GARDNER: Now, one more time, sir. How the hell did you get into the command module?
DOCTOR: I told you. I'm on a top secret mission for the President.
GARDNER: Well, maybe if you just get President Nixon to assure us of that, sir, that would be swell.
DOCTOR: I sent him a message.
NIXON: Hello. I believe it's Mister Gardner. Is that correct? Head of Security?
GARDNER: Er, yes sir. Yes, Mister President.
NIXON: Mister Grant, is it?
GRANT: Yes, Mister President.
NIXON: The hopes and dreams of millions of Americans stand here today at Cape Kennedy, and you're the men who guard those dreams. On behalf of the American people, I thank you.
GARDNER: You're welcome, Mister President.
NIXON: I understand you have a baby on the way, Mister Grant.
GRANT: Yes, Mister President.
NIXON: What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?
GRANT: Just a healthy American, sir.
NIXON: A healthy American will do just nicely. Now, fellows, listen. This man, here, code name the Doctor, is doing some work for me personally. Could you cut him a little slack?
GARDNER: Er, Mister President, he did break in to Apollo 11.
DOCTOR:  Sorry.
NIXON: Well, I'm sure he had a very good reason for that. But I need you to release him now so he can get on with some very important work for the American people. Could you do that for me?
GRANT: Well
NIXON: Son, I am your Commander in Chief.
GARDNER: Then I guess that would be fine, Mister President.
NIXON: Glad to hear it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Bye, bye.
NIXON: Carry on, gentlemen.
RORY: Ahem. America salutes you.
CANTON: This place, it's been closed for years. What have you been doing?
RENFREW: Oh, the child. She must be cared for. It's important. That's what they said.
CANTON: That's what who said?
AMY: Hello. Who are you?
EYE PATCH LADY: No, I think she's just dreaming.
AMY: Hello? I saw you looking through the hatch.
AMY: How? How can that be me?
AMY: Who are you? I don't understand, so just tell me who you are.
AMY: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shoot you. I'm glad I missed. But you killed the Doctor. Or you're going to kill him. But who are you? Just please tell me, because I don't understand.
GIRL: Please help me. Help me. Please.
RENFREW: It's just some questions. Yes, I see.
CANTON: Who was that? Doctor Renfrew. Who was that?
RENFREW: Who was who?
CANTON: What are you? You can tell me, because I won't remember. You invaded us. You're everywhere.
AMY : Help me! Please. I can't see. Somebody, help me.
CANTON: Are you armed?
SILENCE: This world is ours. We have ruled it since the wheel and the fire. We have no need of weapons.
CANTON: Yeah?
CANTON: Welcome to America. Amy!
DOCTOR: You have to tape everything that happens in this office. Every word, or you won't know if you're under the influence.
NIXON: Doctor, you have to give me more than this. What were you doing to Apollo 11?
DOCTOR: Thing. A clever thing. Now, no more questions. You have to trust me and nobody else.
RIVER: Doctor, it's Canton. Quick, he needs us.
AMY : Help me. Please, I can't. I can't see. Somebody help me.
CANTON: Amy! Amy, can you hear me? Amy, I'm going to try to blow the lock. I need you to stand back.
DOCTOR: Okay, gun down. I've got it.
RORY: Amy, we're here. Are you okay?
AMY : I can't see.
RORY: Where is she, Doctor?
RIVER: It's empty.
AMY : It's dark. So dark. I don't know where I am. Please, can anybody hear me?
RORY: They took this out of her. How did they do that, Doctor? Why can I still hear her?
RIVER: Is it a recording?
DOCTOR: Er, it defaults to live. This is current. Wherever she is right now, this is what she's saying.
RORY: Amy, can you hear me? We're coming for you. Wherever you are, we're coming, I swear.
DOCTOR: She can't hear you. I'm so sorry. It's one way.
RORY: She can always hear me, Doctor. Always. Wherever she is, and she always knows that I am coming for her. Do you understand me? Always.
AMY : Doctor, are you out there? Can you hear me? Doctor? Oh, God. Please, please, Doctor, just get me out of this.
RORY: He's coming. I'll bring him, I swear.
RENFREW: Hello? Is somebody there? I think someone has been shot. I think we should help. We c. I can't re. I can't remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. Who and what are you?
SILENCE: Silence, Doctor. We are the Silence.
PRISONER ZERO : Silence, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Rory, listen to that.
RORY : Silence.
ROSANNA : We ran from the Silence.
DOCTOR : The Silence?
SILENCE: And Silence will fall.
CANTON: Hello again.
ISHEM: Sir, you've been in there for days. What the hell have you been doing?
CANTON: It doesn't matter. I need Doctor Shepherd here right now.
ISHEM: Sir, I need to talk to Colonel Jefferson right now.
CANTON: No, you really don't.
NIXON: Er, hiya, fellows. I'm President Nixon. I want to tell you, on behalf of the American people, how much we appreciate all of your hard work.
TELEVISION: The target for the Apollo 11 astronauts, the Moon, at liftoff, will be at a distance of 218,096 miles away. We're just past the two minute mark in the countdown. T minus one minute fifty four seconds and counting.
RIVER: It's an exoskeleton. Basically, life support. There's about twenty different kinds of alien tech in here.
DOCTOR: Who was she? Why put her in here?
RIVER: You put this on, you don't even need to eat. The suit processes sunlight directly. It's got built in weaponry, and a communications system that can hack into anything.
DOCTOR: Including the telephone network?
RIVER: Easily.
DOCTOR: But why phone the President?
RIVER: It defaults to the highest authority it can find. The little girl gets frightened, the most powerful man on Earth gets a phone call. The night terrors with a hotline to the White House.
RIVER: You won't learn anything from that envelope, you know.
DOCTOR: Purchased on earth. Perfectly ordinary stationery. Tardis blue. Summoned by a stranger who won't even show his face. That's a first, for me. How about you?
RIVER: Our lives are back to front. Your future's my past. Your firsts are my lasts.
DOCTOR: That's not really what I asked.
RIVER: Ask something else, then.
DOCTOR: What are the Silence doing, raising a child?
RIVER: Keeping her safe, even giving her independence.
DOCTOR: The only way to save Amy is to work out what the Silence are doing.
RORY: I know.
DOCTOR: And every single thing we learn about them brings us a step closer.
RORY: Yeah, Doctor, I get it. I know.
DOCTOR: Of course, it's possible she's not just any little girl.
RIVER: Well, I'd say she's human, going by the life support software.
DOCTOR: But?
RIVER: She climbed out of this suit. Like she forced her way out. She must be incredibly strong.
DOCTOR: Incredibly strong and running away. I like her.
RIVER: We should be trying to find her.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But how? Anyway, I have the strangest feeling she's going to find us.
TELEVISION: Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
RORY: Why does it look like a NASA spacesuit?
DOCTOR: Because that's what the Silence do. Think about it. They don't make anything themselves. They don't have to. They get other life forms to do it for them.
RIVER: So they're parasites, then.
DOCTOR: Superparasites, standing in the shadows of human history since the very beginning. We know they can influence human behaviour any way they want. If they've been doing that on a global scale for thousands of years.
RORY: Then what?
DOCTOR: Then why did the human race suddenly decide to go to the Moon?
TELEVISION: Ten, nine. Ignition sequence start. six, five, four
DOCTOR: Because the Silence needed a spacesuit.
TELEVISION: One, zero. All engines running. Liftoff. We have a liftoff. Thirty two minutes past the hour, liftoff on Apollo 11.
SHEPHERD: My God. What is it?
CANTON: It's just an alien, Doctor Shepherd.
SHEPHERD: Someone's already been treating it.
CANTON: Yeah, you've been treating it.
SHEPHERD: Does Colonel Jefferson know this thing is here?
CANTON: No.
SHEPHERD: Then I'm going to tell him right now.
CANTON: Again.
SHEPHERD: Sorry, what?
CANTON: Exactly.
SHEPHERD: Sergeant, why was I called in here for no reason?
SILENCE: You tend to my wounds. You are foolish.
CANTON: Why? What would you do in my place?
SILENCE: We have ruled your lives since your lives began. You should kill us all on sight, but you will never remember we were even here. You will evolve.
CANTON: Yeah? Well, sorry to disappoint you, but thanks. That's exactly what I needed to hear. This is a videophone. Whatever a videophone is.
SILENCE : You should kill us all on sight.
AMY : Help me, Doctor.
RIVER: This suit, it seems to be repairing itself. How's it doing that? Doctor, a unit like this, would it ever be able to move without an occupant?
DOCTOR: Why?
RIVER: Well, the little girl said the spaceman was coming to eat her. Maybe that's exactly what happened.
AMY : I love you. I know you think it's him. I know you think it ought to be him, but it's not. It's you. And when I see you again, I'm going to tell you properly, just to see your stupid face. My life was so boring before you just dropped out of the sky. So just get your stupid face where I can see it, okay? Okay?
DOCTOR: She'll be safe for now. No point in a dead hostage.
RORY: Can't you save her?
DOCTOR: I can track that signal back. Take us right to her.
RORY: Then why haven't you?
DOCTOR: Because then what? I find her and then what do I do? This isn't an alien invasion. They live here. This is their empire. This is kicking the Romans out of Rome.
RORY: Rome fell.
DOCTOR: I know. I was there.
RORY: So was I.
DOCTOR: Personal question.
RORY: Seriously, you?
DOCTOR: Do you ever remember it? Two thousand years, waiting for Amy? The last Centurion.
RORY: No.
DOCTOR: You're lying.
RORY: Of course I'm lying.
DOCTOR: Of course you are. Not the sort of thing anyone forgets.
RORY: But I don't remember it all the time. It's like this door in my head. I can keep it shut.
AMY : Please, please, just come and get me. Come and get me.
TELEVISION: The Flight Controller's going to go for landing. Just five days since Apollo 11 blasted off from Cape Kennedy, this unprecedented journey is reaching its crucial moment. Armstrong and Aldrin are making their descent to the surface of the Moon.
DUKE : We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.
AMY: Where am I? Where is this?
SILENCE: You are Amelia Pond.
AMY: You're ugly. Has anyone mentioned that to you?
SILENCE: We do you honour. You will bring the Silence. But your part will soon be over.
AMY: Whatever that means, you've made a big mistake, bringing me here, because wait until you see what's coming for you now.
SILENCE: You have been here many days.
AMY: No, I just got here. You just put me in here.
SILENCE: Your memory is weak. You have been here many days.
AMY: No. No, I can't have been.
SILENCE: You will sleep now. Sleep.
AMY: No.
SILENCE: Sleep.
AMY: No. Get off me. No. No.
SILENCE: Sleep.
AMY: No!
DOCTOR: Oh, interesting. Very Aickman Road. I've seen one of these before. Abandoned. I wonder how that happened? Oh, well I suppose I'm about to find out. Rory, River, keep one Silent in eyeshot at all times. Oh, hello. Sorry, you were in the middle of something. I just had to say, though, have you seen what's on the telly? Oh, hello, Amy. Are you all right? Want to watch some television? Ah. Now, stay where you are. Because look at me, I'm confident. You want to watch that, me, when I'm confident. Oh, and this is my friend River. Nice hair, clever, has her own gun, and unlike me, she really doesn't mind shooting people. I shouldn't like that. Kind of do, a bit.
RIVER: Thank you, sweetie.
DOCTOR: I know you're team players and everything, but she'll definitely kill at least the first three of you.
RIVER: Well, the first seven, easily.
DOCTOR: Seven? Really?
RIVER: Oh, eight for you, honey.
DOCTOR: Stop it.
RIVER: Make me.
DOCTOR: Yeah? Well, maybe I will.
AMY: Is this really important flirting? Because I feel like I should be higher on the list right now.
DOCTOR: Yes. Right. Sorry. As I was saying, my naughty friend here is going to kill the first three of you to attack, plus him behind, so maybe you want to draw lots or have a quiz.
AMY: What's he got?
RORY: Something, I hope.
DOCTOR: Or maybe you could just listen a minute. Because all I really want to do is accept your total surrender and then I'll let you go in peace. Yes, you've been interfering in human history for thousands of years. Yes, people have suffered and died, but what's the point in two hearts, if you can't be a bit forgiving, now and then? Ooo, the Silence. You guys take that seriously, don't you? Okay, you got me. I'm lying. I'm not really going to let you go that easily. Nice thought, but it's not Christmas. First, you tell me about the girl. Who is she? Why is she important? What's she for?
McCANDLESS : And we're getting a picture on the TV.
DOCTOR: Guys, sorry, but you're way out of time. Now, come on. A bit of history for you. Aren't you proud? Because you helped. Now, do you know how many people are watching this live on the telly? Half a billion. And that's nothing, because the human race will spread out among the stars. You just watch them fly. Billions and billions of them, for billions and billions of years, and every single one of them at some point in their lives, will look back at this man, taking that very first step, and they will never, ever forget it.
TELEVISION: Okay, engine stop. ATA on the descent. Modes control both auto. Descent engine command off. 
DOCTOR: Oh. But don't forget this bit. Ready?
CANTON: Ready.
ARMSTRONG : That's one small step for a man
SILENCE : You should kill us all on sight. You should kill us all on sight. You should kill us all on sight. You should kill us all on sight.
DOCTOR: You've given the order for your own execution, and the whole planet just heard you.
SILENCE : You should kill us all on sight.
ARMSTRONG : One giant leap for mankind.
DOCTOR: And one whacking great kick up the backside for the Silence. You just raised an army against yourself and now, for a thousand generations, you're going to be ordering them to destroy you every day. How fast can you run? Because today's the day the human race throw you off their planet. They won't even know they're doing it. I think, quite possibly, the word you're looking for right now is oops. Run! Guys, I mean us. Run.
RORY: I can't get her out!
AMY: Go. Go.
RORY: We are not leaving without you.
AMY: Look, will you just get your stupid face out of here.
RIVER: Run! Into the Tardis, quickly.
DOCTOR: Don't let them build to full power.
RIVER: I know. There's a reason why I'm shooting, honey. What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Helping.
RIVER: You've got a screwdriver. Go build a cabinet.
DOCTOR: That's really rude.
RIVER: Learn how to drive.
RIVER: My old fellow didn't see that, did he? He gets ever so cross.
RORY: So, what kind of doctor are you?
RIVER: Archaeology. Love a tomb.
DOCTOR: You can let me fly it.
RIVER: Yeah, or we could go where we're supposed to.
AMY: What's the matter with you?
RORY: You called me stupid.
AMY: I always call you stupid.
RORY: No, but my face.
RORY: I wasn't sure who you were talking about. You know, me or
AMY: Him?
RORY: Well, you did say dropped out of the sky.
AMY: It's a figure of speech, moron.
RORY: Thanks.
AMY: You're welcome.
NIXON: So we're safe again.
DOCTOR: Safe? No, of course you're not safe. There's about a billion other things out there just waiting to burn your whole world. But, if you want to pretend you're safe, just so you can sleep at night? Okay, you're safe. But you're not really. Canton. Until the next one, eh?
CANTON: Looking forward to it.
DOCTOR: Canton just wants to get married. Hell of a reason to kick him out of the FBI.
NIXON: I'm sure something can be arranged.
DOCTOR: I'm counting on you.
NIXON: Er, Doctor. Canton here tells me you're, you're from the future. It hardly seems possible, but I was wondering
DOCTOR: I should warn you I don't answer a lot of questions.
NIXON: But I'm a President at the beginning of his time. Dare I ask. Will I be remembered?
DOCTOR: Oh, Dicky. Tricky Dicky. They're never going to forget you. Say hi to David Frost for me.
NIXON: David Frost?
NIXON: This person you want to marry. Black?
CANTON: Yes.
NIXON: Hmm. I know what people think of me, but perhaps I'm a little more liberal.
CANTON: He is.
NIXON: I think the Moon is far enough, for now, don't you, Mister Delaware?
CANTON: I figured it might be.
DOCTOR: You could come with us.
RIVER: I escape often enough, thank you. And I have a promise to live up to. You'll understand soon enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. Up to you. See you next time. Call me.
RIVER: What, that's it? What's the matter with you?
DOCTOR: Have I forgotten something?
RIVER: Oh, shut up.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Interesting.
RIVER: What's wrong? You're acting like we've never done that before.
DOCTOR: We haven't.
RIVER: We haven't?
DOCTOR: Oh, look at the time. Must be off. But it was very nice. It was, it was good. It was er, unexpected. You know what they say. There's a first time for everything.
RIVER: And a last time.
DOCTOR: Rory, I'm going to need thermocouplings. The green ones and blue ones.
RORY: Okay, hold on.
DOCTOR: So.
AMY: So.
DOCTOR: You're okay?
AMY: Fine. Head's a bit weird. There's loads of stuff I can't quite remember.
DOCTOR: After effect of the Silence. Natural enough. That's not what I was asking. You told me you were pregnant.
AMY: Yes.
DOCTOR: Why?
AMY: Because I was. I mean, I thought I was. It turns out I wasn't.
DOCTOR: No, why did you tell me?
AMY: Because you're my friend. You're my best friend.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Did you tell Rory?
AMY : No.
DOCTOR : Amy, why tell me and not Rory?
AMY: Why do you think? I travelled with you in this Tardis for so long. All that time. If I was pregnant for some of it, wouldn't it have had an effect?
AMY : I don't want to tell Rory his baby might have three heads or, like, a timehead, or something.
DOCTOR: What's a timehead?
AMY: I don't know, but what if it had one?
DOCTOR: A timehead.
AMY: Shut up.
AMY : Oi, stupid face.
RORY: Er, yeah?
RORY: Hello.
AMY: I'm taking that away from you, if you're going to listen in all the time.
RORY: Okay, that's a fair point. But you should've told me that you thought you were pregnant. I'm a nurse. I'm good with pregnancy.
AMY: Not, as it turns out, that good. So please stop being stupid.
RORY: Er, no, never. I'm never, ever, going to stop being stupid.
DOCTOR: So, this little girl. It's all about her. Who was she? Or we could just go off and have some adventures. Anyone in the mood for adventures? Because I am. You only live once.
TRAMP: Are you okay? Little girl, are you okay?
GIRL: It's all right. It's quite all right. I'm dying. But I can fix that. It's easy, really. See?
