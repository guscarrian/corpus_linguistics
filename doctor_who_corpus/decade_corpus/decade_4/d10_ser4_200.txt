Planet of the Dead
GUARD: Positions.
GUARD: Night, boys.
CHRISTINA: Sorry, lover.
POLICEMAN: We've got the place surrounded, sir.
CHRISTINA: Hello. I'm so terribly sorry. That card paying device thing. That's a Lobster card, am I right?
DRIVER: Oyster card.
CHRISTINA: Ah. Well, that's the problem, you see. I only use my Oyster when there's an R in the month.
DRIVER: It's April.
MACMILLAN: Go, go, go.
CHRISTINA: Diamonds. Genuine. Drive.
DRIVER: Works for me.
POLICEMAN: No sign of her.
DRIVER: You're just in time, mate.
DOCTOR: Hello, I'm the Doctor. Happy Easter.
MACMILLAN: Right, close off the area. Get all these people cleared. She has got to be here somewhere.
POLICEMAN: Robinson, clear the roads. Get the whole place sealed off.
MACMILLAN: She's on the bus! She's on the. Kevin, get the car. It's definitely her. Come on. Move it. Jackson, follow that bus.
DOCTOR: The funny thing is, I don't often do Easter. I can never find it. It's always at a different time. Although I remember the original. Between you and me, what really happened was.
DOCTOR: Oh. Sorry, hold on to that for me. Actually, go on, have it. Finish it. It's full of sugar and I'm determined to keep these teeth.
DOCTOR: Ah. Oh, we've got excitation. I'm picking up something very strange.
CHRISTINA: I know the feeling.
MACMILLAN: All units in pursuit registration Whisky nine seven four Golf Hotel Mike. They're heading for the Gladwell Road Tunnel. Please stop all traffic. Seal off the north end.
OPERATOR: The bus has entered the south entrance of the tunnel. Officers in pursuit. Units now arriving at the north entrance.
DENNISON: Tango one eight three up at the far end, sir. I've sealed off the exit. There's no way out. Over.
MACMILLAN: I'm right behind. We've got her.
DOCTOR: Rhondium particles, that's what I'm looking for. This thing detects them. Look, this should to round, that little dish there.
CHRISTINA: Right now, a way out would come in pretty handy. Can you detect me one of those?
CARMEN: Lou, can you hear them?
LOU: Hear what, sweetheart? 
CARMEN: The voices. So many voices calling to us. Calling so far.
DOCTOR: Ah, the little dish is going round.
CHRISTINA: Fascinating.
DOCTOR: And round. Whoa.
ANGELA: Excuse me. Do you mind?
DOCTOR: Sorry. That was my little dish.
CHRISTINA: Can't you turn that thing off?
DOCTOR: What was your name?
CHRISTINA: Christina.
DOCTOR: Christina, hold on tight. Everyone, hold on!
CARMEN: Oh, the voices. The voices. They're screaming.
NATHAN:  What's going on?
DENNISON: Tango one eight three. Units in position, sir. Er, sorry to report, but, er, no sign of the bus. Over.
MACMILLAN: It's gone. Right in front of me. The bus has just gone.
MACMILLAN [OC} Over.
DOCTOR: End of the line. Call it a hunch, but I think we've gone a little bit further than Brixton.
LOU: We should get out. Even if that's the Sahara, we can't stay on board this thing.
CARMEN: I'm not going out there. They're still calling. All around us. The voices are crying.
LOU: What voices, sweetheart?
CARMEN: The dead. We're surrounded by the dead.
ANGELA: It's impossible. There are three suns. Three of them.
BARCLAY:  Like when all those planets were up in the sky.
NATHAN: But it was Earth that moved back then, wasn't it?
BARCLAY: Oh, man, we're on another world.
DRIVER: It's still intact, though. Not as bad as it looks, and the chassis's still holding together. My boss is going to murder me.
ANGELA: Can you still drive it?
DRIVER: Oh no, no, no. The wheels are stuck. Look at them, they're never going to budge.
MACMILLAN: Dennison, listen. We've sealed off the far end. Nothing is to come through.
DENNISON: But I don't understand, sir. How can a bus just disappear?
CHRISTINA: Ready for every emergency.
DOCTOR: Me too.
CHRISTINA: And what's your name?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
CHRISTINA: Name, not rank.
DOCTOR: The Doctor.
CHRISTINA: Surname?
DOCTOR: The Doctor.
CHRISTINA: You're called the Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am.
CHRISTINA: That's not a name. That's a psychological condition.
DOCTOR: Funny sort of sand, this. There's a trace of something else.  Glah. Not good.
CHRISTINA: Well, it wouldn't be. It's sand.
DOCTOR: No, it tastes like. Never mind.
CHRISTINA: What is it? What's wrong?
BARCLAY: Hold on a minute. I saw you, mate. You had that thing, that machine. Did you make this happen?
DOCTOR: Oh, humans on buses, always blaming me. Look, look, if you must know, I was tracking a hole in the fabric of reality. Call it a hobby. But it was a tiny little hole. No danger to anyone. Suddenly it gets big, and we drive right through it.
DRIVER: But then where is it? There's nothing. There's just sand.
DOCTOR: All right. You want proof? We drove through this.
MACMILLAN: What the hell was that?
CHRISTINA: And that's?
DOCTOR: A door. A door in space.
DRIVER: So what you're saying is, on the other side of that is home? We can get to London through there?
DOCTOR: The bus came through, but we can't.
DRIVER: Well then, what are we waiting for?
DOCTOR: No, no, don't.
DRIVER: I'm going home, mate!
DOCTOR: I said don't.
BARCLAY: He was a skeleton, man. He was bones. Just bones.
MACMILLAN: Dennison, er, I think we're out of our depth here. We need experts. Get me UNIT. Emergency code one.
DOCTOR: It was the bus. Look at the damage. That was the bus protecting us. Great big box of metal.
CHRISTINA: Rather like a Faraday cage?
NATHAN: Like in a thunderstorm, yeah? Safest place is inside a car, because the metal conducts the lightning right through. We did it in school.
CHRISTINA: But if we can only travel back inside the bus? A Faraday cage needs to be closed. That thing's been ripped wide open.
DOCTOR: Well, slightly different dynamics with a wormhole. There's enough metal to make it work, I think. I hope.
CHRISTINA: Then we have to drive five tons of bus, which is currently buried in the sand, and we've got nothing but our bare hands. Correct?
DOCTOR: I'd say nine and a half tons, but the point still stands, yes.
CHRISTINA: Then we need to apply ourselves to the problem with discipline. Which starts with appointing a leader.
DOCTOR: Yes. At last. Thank you. So.
CHRISTINA: Well, thank goodness you've got me. Everyone do exactly as I say. Inside the bus immediately.
NATHAN: Is it safe in there?
CHRISTINA: I don't think anything's safe any more, but if it's a choice between baking in there or roasting out here, I'd say baking is slower. Come on. All of you. Right now. And you. The Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, ma'am.
CHRISTINA:  Up. Come on.
CHRISTINA: Point five. The crucial thing is, do not panic. Quite apart from anything else, the smell of sweat inside this thing is reaching atrocious levels. We don't need to add any more. Point six. Team identification. Names. I'm Christina. This man is apparently the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hello.
CHRISTINA: And you?
NATHAN: Nathan.
BARCLAY: I'm Barclay.
ANGELA: Angela. Angela Whittaker.
LOU: My name's Louis. Everyone calls me Lou. And this is Carmen.
CHRISTINA: Excellent. Memorise those names. There might be a test. Point seven. Assessment and application of knowledge. Over to you, the Doctor.
DOCTOR: I thought you were in charge.
CHRISTINA: I am. And a good leader utilises her strength. You seem to be the brainbox. So, start boxing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, the wormhole. We were in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was just an accident.
CARMEN: No, it wasn't. That thing, the doorway? Someone made it for a reason.
DOCTOR: How do you know?
LOU: She's got a gift. Ever since she was a little girl, she can just tell things. We do the lottery twice a week.
CHRISTINA: You don't look like millionaires.
LOU: No, but we win ten pounds. Every week, twice a week, ten pounds. Don't tell me that's not a gift.
DOCTOR: Tell me, Carmen. How many fingers am I holding up?
CARMEN: Three.
CARMEN: Four.
DOCTOR: Very good. Low level psychic ability, exacerbated by an alien sun. What can you see, Carmen? Tell me, what's out there?
CARMEN: Something, something is coming. Riding on the wind, and shining.
DOCTOR: What is it?
CARMEN: Death. Death is coming.
ANGELA: We're going to die.
BARCLAY: I knew it, man. I said so.
NATHAN: We can't die out here. No one's going to find us.
CHRISTINA: This isn't exactly helping.
BARCLAY: You can shut up too. We're not your soldiers.
CHRISTINA: That's not doing any good.
LOU: Quiet.
NATHAN: Will we be bones, like the bus driver?
CHRISTINA: Stop whimpering, all of you.
DOCTOR: All right now, stop it. Everyone, stop it! Angela, look at me. Angela? Angela? Answer me one question, Angela. That's it. At me, at me. There we go. Angela, just answer me one thing. When you got on this bus, where were you going?
ANGELA: Doesn't matter now, does it?
DOCTOR: Answer the question.
ANGELA: Just home.
DOCTOR: And what's home?
ANGELA: Me and Mike. And Suzanne. That's my daughter. She's eighteen.
DOCTOR: Suzanne. Good. What about you?
BARCLAY: Don't know. Going round Tina's.
DOCTOR: Who's Tina? Your girlfriend?
BARCLAY: Not yet.
DOCTOR: Good boy. What about you, Nathan?
NATHAN: Bit strapped for cash. I lost my job last week. I was going to stay in and watch TV.
DOCTOR: Brilliant. And you two?
LOU: I was going to cook.
CARMEN: It's his turn tonight. Then I clear up.
DOCTOR: What's for tea?
LOU: Chops. Nice couple of chops and gravy. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's special, Lou. That is so special. Chops and gravy, mmm. What about you, Christina?
CHRISTINA: I was going so far away.
DOCTOR: Far away. Chops and gravy. Watching TV. Mike and Suzanne and poor old Tina.
BARCLAY: Hey.
DOCTOR: Just think of them. Because that planet out there, all three suns, wormholes and alien sand, that planet is nothing. You hear me? Nothing, compared to all those things waiting for you. Food and home and people. Hold on to that, because we're going to get there. I promise. I'm going to get you home.
SERGEANT: Section one, assume positions. Section two, assume positions.
CORPORAL: Section three, assume positions.
SOLDIER: Section four, spread out.
SERGEANT: Take places, intervention mode.
MAGAMBO: Isolate the area.
SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am.
MAGAMBO: Establish an exclusion zone. Any media, move them back. Any trouble, arrest them,
SOLDIER 2: Yes, ma'am.
MAGAMBO: I want the vehicles in the standard Procedure Five layout. All outreach officers will report to me via Sergeant Calhoon, is that understood?
SOLDIER 3: Yes, ma'am.
MACMILLAN: Captain, I'm Detective Inspector McMillan.
MAGAMBO: Clear the area, thank you.
MACMILLAN: Yes, but I was here when the thing, the bus with the
MAGAMBO: I've read the report. Now clear the area. Pandovski, get these men out of the zone.
MACMILLAN: Yes, but there's somebody on board that bus. She's mine.
PANDOVSKI: Just move back, sir.
MACMILLAN: All right.
MAGAMBO: Perimeter guard, stand ready. Stay alert. Any hostile activity, shoot to kill.
BARCLAY: Here we go.
DOCTOR: That's my boys. See, we lay a flat surface between the bus and the wormhole, like duckboards, and we reverse into it.
CHRISTINA: Let some air out of the tyres. Just a little bit. It spreads the weight of the bus, gives you more grip against the sand.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's good.
CHRISTINA: Holidays in the Kalahari.
BARCLAY: Yeah, but those wheels go deep.
CHRISTINA: Then start digging.
BARCLAY: With what?
CHRISTINA: With this.
DOCTOR: Got anything else in there?
CHRISTINA: Try that. It might help with the seats.
NATHAN: Thanks.
ANGELA: I can't find the keys.
DOCTOR: Oh no, buses don't have keys. There's a master switch, then it's one button to start, the other one to stop, yeah?
ANGELA: Right. Hold on. Oh, I've got it. Here we go. Hold tight. Ding, ding.
DOCTOR: Ooo, that doesn't sound too good.
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind losing half the top deck. You know what's worse? Sand. Tiny little grains of sand. The engine's clogged up.
CHRISTINA: Anyone know mechanics?
BARCLAY: Me. I did a two week NVQ at the garage. Never finished it, but
DOCTOR: Off you go, then. Try stripping the air filter. Fast as you can. Back in two ticks.
CHRISTINA: Wait a minute. You're the man with all the answers. I'm not letting you out of my sight.
DOCTOR: Easier if you left that backpack behind.
CHRISTINA: Where I go, it goes.
DOCTOR: A backpack with a spade and an axe. Christina, who's going so far away, and yet scared by the sound of a siren. Who are you?
CHRISTINA: You can talk. Let's just say we're two equal mysteries.
DOCTOR: We make quite a couple.
CHRISTINA: We don't make any sort of couple, thank you very much. Come on then. Tell me. If Carmen's right, if that wormhole's not an accident, then what is it? Has someone done this on purpose?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but every single instinct of mine is telling me to get off this planet right now.
CHRISTINA: And do you think we can?
DOCTOR: I live in hope.
CHRISTINA: That must be nice. It's Christina de Souza. To be precise, Lady Christina de Souza.
DOCTOR: Ooo, that's handy, because I'm a Lord.
CHRISTINA; Seriously? The Lord of where?
DOCTOR: It's quite a big estate.
CHRISTINA: No, but there's something more about you. That device you were carrying, and the wormhole. Like you knew. And the way you stride around this place, like.
DOCTOR: Like?
CHRISTINA: Like you're not quite
DOCTOR: Anyway, come on. Allons-y.
CHRISTINA: Oui, mais pas si nous allons vers un cauchemar.
DOCTOR: Oh, we were made for each other.
DOCTOR: Ah, don't like the look of that.
CHRISTINA: Storm clouds. Must be hundreds of miles away.
DOCTOR: But getting closer.
CHRISTINA: If that's a sand storm, we'll get ripped to shreds.
DOCTOR: It's a storm. Who says it's sand?
CARMEN: Closer, and closer, and closer.
DOCTOR: Where is it?
BARCLAY: There. There on the seat.
CHRISTINA: You're hardly going to get a signal. We're on another planet.
DOCTOR: Oh, just watch me. Right. Now, bit of hush, thank you. Got to remember the number, very important number.
VOICE : Hello, Pizza Geronimo?
DOCTOR: And again. Ah. seven six, not six seven.
COMPUTER: This is the Unified Intelligence Taskforce. Please select one of the following four options. If you want to
DOCTOR: Oh, I hate these things.
ANGELA: If you keep your finger pressed on zero, you get through to a real person. I saw it on Watchdog.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Angela.
WOMAN : UNIT helpline. Which department would you like?
DOCTOR: Listen, it's the Doctor. It's me.
CALHOON: Captain. Urgent call, ma'am, relayed direct from HQ.
MAGAMBO: Who is it?
CALHOON: It's him, ma'am. It's the Doctor.
MAGAMBO : Doctor?
MAGAMBO: This is Captain Erisa Magambo. Might I say, sir
MAGAMBO : It's an honour.
DOCTOR: Did you just salute?
MAGAMBO: No.
DOCTOR: Erisa, it's about the bus. HQ said you're at the tunnel, yeah?
MAGAMBO: And where are you?
DOCTOR : I'm on the bus.
DOCTOR: But apart from that, not a clue, except it's very pretty and pretty dangerous.
MAGAMBO : A body came through
MAGAMBO: Here. Have you sustained any more fatalities?
DOCTOR: No, and we're not going to, but I'm stuck. I haven't got the Tardis, and I need to analyse that wormhole.
MAGAMBO: We have a scientific advisor on site. Doctor Malcolm Taylor.
MAGAMBO : Just the man you need. He's a genius.
DOCTOR : Oh, is he? We'll see about that.
MAGAMBO: It's the Doctor.
TAYLOR: No, I'm all right now, thanks. It was just a bit of a sore throat. Although I've got to be honest, a cup of tea might be nice.
MAGAMBO: It's the Doctor.
TAYLOR: Do you mean the Doctor Doctor?
MAGAMBO : I know. We all want to meet him one day, but
MAGAMBO: We all know what that day will bring.
DOCTOR : I can hear everything you're saying.
TAYLOR: Hello, Doctor?
TAYLOR : Oh, my goodness!
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. Hello, Malcolm.
TAYLOR: The Doctor. Cor blimey. I can't believe I'm actually speaking to you. I mean, I've read all the files.
DOCTOR: Really? What was your favourite, the giant robot? No, no, hold on. Let's sort out that wormhole. Excuse me.
MAGAMBO: On speakerphone, please. I don't want anyone keeping secrets.
DOCTOR: Malcolm, something's not making sense here. I've got a storm and a wormhole, and I can't help thinking there's a connection. I need a complete full range analysis
DOCTOR : Of that wormhole. The whole thing.
TAYLOR: Well, I've probably got the wrong idea, but I've wired up an integrator. I thought it could measure
TAYLOR : The energy signature.
DOCTOR: No. No, no, no, no, no. That'll never work. Listen.
TAYLOR : It's quite extraordinary, though.
TAYLOR: I'm measuring an oscillation of fifteen Malcolms per second.
DOCTOR: Fifteen what?
TAYLOR: Fifteen Malcolms. It's my own little term. A wavelength parcel of ten kilohertz operating in four dimensions equals one Malcolm.
DOCTOR: You named a unit of measurement after yourself?
TAYLOR: Well, it didn't do Mister Watt any harm. Furthermore, one hundred Malcolms equals a Bernard.
DOCTOR : And who's that
DOCTOR: Your dad?
TAYLOR: Don't be ridiculous. That's Quatermass.
DOCTOR: Right. Fine. But before I die of old age, which in my case would be quite an achievement, so congratulations on that
DOCTOR : Is there anyone else I can talk to?
TAYLOR: No, no, no, no, but listen. I set the scanner to register what it can't detect and inverted the image.
DOCTOR: You did what?
TAYLOR: Is that wrong?
DOCTOR: No. Malcolm, that's brilliant. So you can actually measure the wormhole. Okay.
DOCTOR : I admit that is genius.
TAYLOR: The Doctor called me a genius.
MAGAMBO; I know. I heard.
DOCTOR: Now, run a capacity scan.
DOCTOR : I need a full report. Call me back when you've done it. And Malcolm?
DOCTOR: You're my new best friend.
TAYLOR: And you're mine too, sir.
DOCTOR: Barclay, I'm holding on to this.
BARCLAY: Hey, you'd better bring it back.
TAYLOR: You're, you're mine. He's gone. He's gone.
DOCTOR: Send this back to Earth. See if Malcolm can analyse the storm.
CHRISTINA: There's something in those clouds. Something shining. Look.
DOCTOR: Like metal. Why would there be metal in a storm?
CARMEN: So fast and strong. They ride the storm. They are the storm.
LOU: But what are they?
CARMEN: They devour.
CHRISTINA: Did you hear something?
DOCTOR: Hold on. Busy.
CHRISTINA: There was a noise, like a sort of.
CHRISTINA: Doctor.
CARMEN: There's something new.
DOCTOR: That's wait. I shout wait, people usually wait.
CHRISTINA: You speak the language?
DOCTOR: Every language.  That's begging for mercy.
CHRISTINA: That means move.
DOCTOR: Ooo, you're learning.
CHRISTINA: These fly things, they must be responsible. They brought us here.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. Look at the ship. It's a wreck. They crashed, just like us.
CHRISTINA: Oh, but this place is freezing.
DOCTOR: Mmm. The hull's made of photafine steel. Turns cold when it's hot. Boiling desert outside, freezing ship inside. Since I met you, Christina, we've been through all the extremes.
CHRISTINA: That's how I like things, extreme.
DOCTOR: Oh, this is beautiful. Intact, it must have been magnificent. A proper streamlined deep spacer.
CHRISTINA: I'll remember that as I'm being slowly tortured. At least I'm bleeding on the floor of a really well designed spaceship.
DOCTOR: Oh, right, good. Yes. Hello. That's a telepathic translator. He can understand us.
CHRISTINA: Still sounds like gibberish to me.
DOCTOR: That's what I said. He can understand us. It doesn't work the other way round.  You will suffer for your crimes, etcetera. You have committed an act of violence against the Tritovore race. Tritovores. They're called Tritovores. You came here in the two hundred to destroy us. Sorry, what's the two hundred?
CHRISTINA: It's the bus. Number two hundred. They mean the bus.
DOCTOR: Oh. No, look, I think you're making the same mistake Christina did. I'm the Doctor, by the way, and this is Christina. The Honourable Lady Christina. At least I hope she's honourable. We got pulled through that wormhole. The two hundred doesn't look like that normally. It's broken, just the same as you.
CHRISTINA: What are they doing?
DOCTOR: They believe me.
CHRISTINA: What, as simple as that?
DOCTOR: I've got a very honest face. And the translator says I'm telling the truth. Plus the face. Right. So, first things first. There's a very strange storm heading our way. Can you send out a probe? Oh, they've lost power. Hmm, the crash knocked the mainline crystallography out of synch. But if I can jiggle it back.
DOCTOR: I thank you. Yes, I am. Frequently. Okey doke, let's launch that probe.
DOCTOR: The Scorpion Nebula. We're on the other side of the universe. Just what you wanted. So far away. The planet of San Helios.
CHRISTINA: And that's us? We're on another world.
DOCTOR: We have been for quite a while.
CHRISTINA: I know, but seeing it like that.
DOCTOR: It's good, isn't it?
CHRISTINA; Wonderful.
DOCTOR: The Tritovores were going to trade with San Helios. Population of one hundred billion. Plenty of waste matter for them to absorb.
CHRISTINA: By waste matter, you mean
DOCTOR: They feed off what others leave behind from their behind, if you see what I mean. It's perfectly natural. They are flies.
CHRISTINA: Charming. Just remind me never to kiss them.
DOCTOR: San Helios City.
CHRISTINA: That's amazing. But you've seen this sort of thing before, haven't you?
DOCTOR: Thousands of times.
CHRISTINA; That Lordship of yours. The Lord of where, exactly?
DOCTOR; Of Time. I come from a race of people called Time Lords.
CHRISTINA: You're an alien?
DOCTOR: Yeah. But you don't have to kiss me either.
CHRISTINA: You look human.
DOCTOR: You look Time Lord. Anyway.
CHRISTINA: So if that's San Helios, all we need to do is find that city. They can help us.
DOCTOR: I don't think it's that simple. We're in the city right now.
CHRISTINA: But it's sand. That first image, the temples and things, what's that then, ancient history?
DOCTOR: The image was taken last year.
CHRISTINA: It became a desert in one year?
DOCTOR: I said there was something in the sand. The city, the oceans, the mountains, the wildlife, and a hundred billion people turned to sand. All those voices in Carmen's head. She's hearing them die.
CHRISTINA: But I've got sand in my hair. That's dead people. Oh, that's disgusting. Oh.
DOCTOR: Something destroyed the whole of San Helois.
CHRISTINA: Yes, but in my hair.
DOCTOR : Malcolm, tell me the bad news.
TAYLOR: Oh, you are clever. It is bad news. It's the wormhole, Doctor. It's getting bigger.
TAYLOR : We've gone way past
TAYLOR: One hundred Bernards. I haven't invented a name for that.
DOCTOR : How can it get bigger by itself?
TAYLOR: Well, that's why I'm phoning. You'll work it out, if I know you, sir.
MAGAMBO: Doctor, we estimate the circumference of your invisible wormhole is now four miles
MAGAMBO : Heading upwards. I've grounded all flights above London.
MAGAMBO: We can't risk anyone else falling through.
DOCTOR: Good work, both of you.
MAGAMBO: But I have to know. Does that wormhole
MAGAMBO : Constitute a danger to this planet?
DOCTOR: Oh, sorry. Call waiting. Got to go.
MAGAMBO: Call waiting?
TAYLOR: He's a devil, that one.
DOCTOR: Yeah?
NATHAN: Doctor, it's Nathan.
NATHAN : We got those duckboard things down, but
ANGELA: It's my fault.
NATHAN: No, it's not. Don't say that.
DOCTOR: Why, what's happened?
NATHAN: We kept on turning the engine, but, we're out of petrol. Used it all up. Even if we can get those wheels out
NATHAN : This bus is never going to move.
CHRISTINA: What is it, what's wrong? Doctor, tell me.
NATHAN : You promised you'd get us home. Doctor?
NATHAN: Are you still there?
CHRISTINA: Doctor, tell me. What did he say?
DOCTOR: It's the probe. It's reached the storm.
CHRISTINA: And what's he saying?
DOCTOR: It's not a storm.
CHRISTINA: It's a swarm. Millions of them.
DOCTOR: Billions. Oh, we've lost the probe. I think it got eaten. Everything on this planet gets eaten.
CHRISTINA: How far away is that swarm?
DOCTOR: A hundred miles. But at that speed, it'll be here in twenty minutes. No, no, no, they're not just coming for us. They want the wormhole.
CHRISTINA: They're heading for Earth?
DOCTOR: Show the analysis. Incredible. They swarm out of a wormhole, strip the planet bare, then move on to the next world. Start the life cycle all over again.
CHRISTINA: So, they make the wormholes?
DOCTOR: They must do.
CHRISTINA: But how? They don't exactly look like technicians. And if the wormhole belongs to them, why are they a hundred miles away?
DOCTOR: Because they need to be? No, that's bonkers. Hang on. Yes. Oh, do you see? Billions of them, flying in formation, all around the planet. Round and round and round, faster and faster and faster, till they generate a rupture in space. The speed of them, and the numbers, and the size, all of that rips the wormhole into existence.
CHRISTINA: And the wormhole's getting bigger?
DOCTOR: Because they're getting closer.
CHRISTINA: But how do they get through? Because that wormhole's a killer. We've seen it.
DOCTOR; No, no, no, look. See the exoskeleton.
CHRISTINA: Metal?
DOCTOR: They've got bones of metal. They eat metal and extrude it into the exoskeleton. So their velocity makes the wormhole, then their body makes it safe. Perfect design.
CHRISTINA: Those things are going to turn the entire Earth into a desert. So why exactly are you smiling?
DOCTOR: Worse it gets, the more I love it.
CHRISTINA: Me too.
NATHAN: It sounds like a storm.
ANGELA: If it rains, we've got water.
CARMEN: No water. All of it dust. But the girl.
LOU: Don't now, sweetheart. What girl?
CARMEN: The girl. She will fly.
CHRISTINA: The thing is, Doctor, you're missing the obvious. We came here through the wormhole, yes? But our Tritovore friends didn't. They came here to trade with San Helios. Therefore, the question is, why did they crash?
DOCTOR: Ah, good question. What a team. Like she said, why did you crash?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Gravity well. Look, goes all the way down to the engine. So what happened? He says the drive system stalled. Ten miles up, they fell out of the sky. But what caused that?
CHRISTINA: Which means no idea.
DOCTOR: Yeah. But wait a minute. That's a crystal nucleus down there, yes? And it looks like it survived the crash. If the crystal's intact? Oh, yes. That's better than diesel.
CHRISTINA: What, you can use the crystal to move the bus?
DOCTOR: I think so. The spaceship's a write-off, but the two hundred's small enough.
CHRISTINA: How does a crystal drive a bus?
DOCTOR: In a super clever outer-spacey way. Just trust me. There's the crystal! It's fallen to the bottom of the well. Have you got access shafts? All frozen? Well, maybe I can open them. Ah! Internal comms. Put that on.
DOCTOR: You stay here. Keep an eye on the shaft. Tell me if anything happens.
DOCTOR: If I can use that sunlight to start the automatic maintenance. Christina? If you see a panel opening in that shaft, let me know.
CHRISTINA: Nothing yet.
DOCTOR: Anything now?
CHRISTINA: Afraid not.
DOCTOR: Any sign of movement?
CHRISTINA: Nope.
DOCTOR: How's that?
CHRISTINA: Nothing.
DOCTOR: Any result?
CHRISTINA: Not a dickie bird. So let me get this right. You need that crystal? Then consider it done.
DOCTOR: Why, what do you mean? Christina? Christina!
CHRISTINA: The aristocracy survives for a reason. We're ready for anything.
DOCTOR: No!
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on, come on, come on. That's better.
CHRISTINA: I decide when I stop, thank you.
DOCTOR: You're about to hit the security grid. Look.
CHRISTINA; Excellent. So what do I do?
DOCTOR: Try the big red button.
CHRISTINA: Well done.
DOCTOR: Now come back up. I can do that.
CHRISTINA: Oh, don't you wish.
DOCTOR: Slowly.
CHRISTINA: Yes, sir.
DOCTOR: Quite the mystery, aren't you? Lady Christina de Souza, carrying a winch in her bag.
CHRISTINA: No stranger than you, spaceman.
DOCTOR: I had this friend, once. She called me spaceman.
CHRISTINA: And was she right? Do you zoom about the place in a rocket?
DOCTOR: Well, a little blue box. Travels in more than space. It can journey through time, Christina. Oh, the places I've been. World War One. Creation of the universe. End of the universe. The war between China and Japan. And the Court of King Athelstan in 924 AD.
DOCTOR: But I don't remember you being there. So what are you doing with this?
CHRISTINA: Excuse me. A gentleman never goes through a lady's possessions.
DOCTOR: It's the Cup of Athelstan, given to the first King of Britain as a coronation gift from Hywel, King of the Welsh. But it's been held in the International Gallery for two hundred years, which makes you, Lady Christina, a thief.
CHRISTINA: I like to think I liberated it.
DOCTOR: Don't tell me you need the money.
CHRISTINA: Daddy lost everything. Invested his fortune in the Icelandic banks.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. If you're short of cash, you rob a bank. Stealing this? That's a lifestyle.
CHRISTINA: I take it you disapprove?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Except. That little blue box, I stole it from my own people.
CHRISTINA: Good boy. You were right. We're quite a team.
CHRISTINA: What the blazes was that?
DOCTOR: We never did find out why the ship crashed. Christina, I think you should come back up.
CHRISTINA: Too late. I can see it.
DOCTOR: Careful. Slowly. Have you got an open-vent system?
DOCTOR: I thought so.
CHRISTINA: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It's like when birds fly into the engines of an aircraft.
CHRISTINA: One of the creatures.
DOCTOR: It got trapped in the vents, caused the crash. Christina, get out.
CHRISTINA: It's not moving. I think it's injured.
DOCTOR: No, it's dormant because it's so cold down there, but your body heat is raising the temperature.
CHRISTINA: I tend to have that effect. Almost there.
DOCTOR: Not just the crystal. I need the whole bed, the plate thing.
CHRISTINA: I've got it!
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's going to eat its way up.
DOCTOR: Ooo, she's good.
DOCTOR: That's it, that's it, that's it. I've got you. I've got you. Isn't she just.
DOCTOR: Commander? Mission complete. Now, we've got to get back to the two hundred, all of us. Oh, don't be so daft. A captain can leave his ship, if there's a bus standing by.
CHRISTINA: What the hell was that? Is this place safe? It's the creature. It's not dead.
DOCTOR: Maybe you didn't hit just one of them. If you hit a swarm?
CHRISTINA: Do you mean if there's more on board?
DOCTOR: This ship's built inside a metal sleeve. They can move through the infrastructure, all around us. And those things wake up hungry. Commander, you've got to come with us right now.
CHRISTINA: Come back to Earth. We'll find you a home.
DOCTOR: And that's the word of a lady. Come on.
DOCTOR: No, don't.
DOCTOR: There's nothing we can do. Run!
ANGELA: What sort of storm is that?
CARMEN: Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run.
TAYLOR: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not now, Malcolm!
TAYLOR: Fair do's. He's a busy man.
NATHAN: At last. Where've you been?
DOCTOR: Get inside. Get them sitting down. Now then, let's have a look.
CHRISTINA: So what does that crystal do?
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing. Don't need the crystal.
CHRISTINA: Oh, I risked my life for that.
DOCTOR: No, no. You risked your life for these. The clamps.
DOCTOR: One there. One there. One there. And one there.
CHRISTINA: But what are the clamps for? Do they turn the wheels?
DOCTOR: Yeah, something like that. I just need to fix this. Have you got a hammer in that bag?
CHRISTINA: Funnily enough.
DOCTOR: Phone, phone. Press redial.
DOCTOR: Malcolm, it's me.
TAYLOR: I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Ready for what?
TAYLOR: I don't know. You tell me.
I'm going to try to get back.
DOCTOR : But listen, there might be something following us. You need to close the wormhole.
TAYLOR: Would that be a compressed burst of feedback on a
TAYLOR : Counter-oscillation, perchance?
DOCTOR: Oh, Malcolm, you're
DOCTOR : Brilliant.
TAYLOR: Coming from you, sir, that means the world.
MAGAMBO: Doctor
MAGAMBO : What sort of something?
MAGAMBO: That wormhole is now measuring ten miles and growing. I need to know the exact nature
MAGAMBO : Of the threat.
DOCTOR: Sorry, got to go.
MAGAMBO: All troops, mobilise and stand ready. Possible Code Red. Unknown.
CALHOON: Understood. Code Red. Repeat, Code Red unknown.
SERGEANT: Section two, armed.
CORPORAL: Section three, armed.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's not compatible. Bus, spaceship, spaceship, bus. I need to weld the two systems together.
CHRISTINA: And how do you do that?
DOCTOR: I need something non-corrosive. Something malleable. Something ductile. Something gold.
CHRISTINA: Oh no you don't.
DOCTOR: Christina, what is it worth now?
BARCLAY: Hey, hey, use this.
DOCTOR: I said gold.
BARCLAY: It is gold.
DOCTOR: Oh, they saw you coming. Christina.
CHRISTINA: It's over a thousand years old, worth eighteen million pounds. Promise me you'll be careful.
DOCTOR: I promise.
CHRISTINA: I hate you.
TAYLOR: Done it. Transmit that, and the wormhole should close.
MAGAMBO: Then do it.
TAYLOR: Well, after the Doctor's come through, obviously.
MAGAMBO: I'm sorry. Believe me. That wormhole constitutes a major threat, and I have a duty to every man, woman and child on this planet. It's got to be closed immediately. That's an order.
TAYLOR: No, no, no, no. No, we can't just abandon him. He's the Doctor. How many times has he saved our lives? I won't let you, ma'am. I simply won't.
MAGAMBO: Right now, soldier.
DOCTOR: This is your driver speaking. Hold on tight.
BARCLAY: But what for? What's he doing?
CHRISTINA: Do as he says. What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Come on. That's it. You can do it, you beauty. One last trip.
BARCLAY: Ah, you are so kidding me.
NATHAN: We're flying. It's flying.
LOU: He's flying the bus.
ANGELA: It's a miracle.
DOCTOR: Anti-gravity clamps. Didn't I say? Round we go.
CARMEN: Doctor, they're coming.
TAYLOR: I will never surrender. Never.
CHRISTINA: Do you think this thing will survive the journey back?
DOCTOR: Only one way to find out. Next stop.
CHRISTINA: Planet Earth!
BARCLAY: It's London!
ANGELA: We're back home.
NATHAN: He did it. He did it!
CALHOON: Captain!
CALHOON : Captain, they're back. It's the bus, ma'am, it's come back and it's flying.
MAGAMBO: Code Red. Fire at will.
SERGEANT: Concentrate your fire!
DOCTOR : Malcolm, close that wormhole.
TAYLOR: Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.
DOCTOR: He's hung up on me.
TAYLOR: Oh, no, no. No.
DOCTOR: Malcolm!
TAYLOR: Not now, I'm busy.
DOCTOR: He's hung up again.
DOCTOR: Malcolm, listen to me.
TAYLOR: It's not working.
DOCTOR: I need that signal. We've got billions of those things
DOCTOR : About to fly through.
TAYLOR: Well, what do I do?
DOCTOR: Loop it back through the integrator, and keep the signal ramping up.
TAYLOR; But by how much?
DOCTOR: Five hundred Bernards. Do it now!
TAYLOR: Yes!
TAYLOR: Yes!
MAGAMBO: Target at nine o'clock.
MAGAMBO: I don't believe it. Guns that work.
NATHAN: Doctor, it's coming for us.
DOCTOR: Oh no, you don't.
MAGAMBO: Twelve o'clock. Take it out.
MAGAMBO: Cease fire.
CALHOON: Cease fire!
MAGAMBO: Arms down.
CHRISTINA: Did I say I hated you? I was lying.
DOCTOR: Do not stand forward of this point. Ladies and gentlemen, you have reached your final destination. Welcome home, the mighty two hundred.
CALHOON: Welcome back. If you could step away from the bus, just to be safe. As fast as you can, thank you. It's standard procedure. We need to screen you and then you'll all be taken to debriefing.
DOCTOR: I don't count.
CHRISTINA: No, but Doctor?
CALHOON: With me, thank you.
TAYLOR: Doctor.
DOCTOR: You must be Malcolm.
TAYLOR: Oh. Oh. I love you. I love you. I love you.
MAGAMBO: To your station, Doctor Taylor.
TAYLOR: Yes, ma'am. I love you.
MAGAMBO: Doctor, I salute you whether you like it or not. Now, I take it we're safe from those things?
DOCTOR: They'll start again. Generate a new doorway. It's not their fault, it's their natural life cycle. But I'll see if I can nudge the wormholes on to uninhabited planets. Closer to home, Captain. Those two lads. Very good in a crisis. Nathan needs a job, Barclay's good with engines. You could do a lot worse. Privates Nathan and Barclay, UNIT's finest.
MAGAMBO: I'll see what I can do. And I've got something for you.
DOCTOR: Better than a bus, any day. Hello.
MAGAMBO: Found in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.
DOCTOR: Oh, she doesn't mind.
MAGAMBO: Now, I've got three dead alien stingrays to clear up. I don't suppose you fancy helping with the paperwork?
DOCTOR: Not a chance.
MAGAMBO: Till we meet again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I hope so.
ANGELA: I said I'm back, Suzanne. I'm home. They didn't even know I was gone.
CHRISTINA: That's quite enough of that.
MACMILLAN: She is not getting away this time.
CHRISTINA: Little blue box, just like you said. Right then. Off we go. Come on, Doctor, show me the stars.
DOCTOR: No.
CHRISTINA: What?
DOCTOR: I said no.
CHRISTINA: But I saved your life. And you saved mine.
DOCTOR: So?
CHRISTINA: We're surrounded by police. I'll go to prison.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
CHRISTINA: But you were right. It's not about the money. I only steal things for the adventure, and today with you. I want more days like this. I want every day to be like this. We're made for each other. You said so yourself. The perfect team. Why not?
DOCTOR: People have travelled with me and I've lost them. Lost them all. Never again.
MACMILLAN: Lady Christina de Souza. Oh, I have waited a long time to say this. I am arresting you on suspicion of theft. You do not have to say anything, etcetera, etcetera. Dennison, take her away.
CARMEN: Doctor? You take care now.
DOCTOR: You too. Chops and gravy, lovely. 
CARMEN: No, but you be careful. Because your song is ending, sir.
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
CARMEN: It is returning. It is returning through the dark. And then, Doctor? Oh, but then he will knock four times.
DENNISON: Oi!
MACMILLAN: Stop that woman! Stop that woman! Stop her. Don't just stand there, stop her.
MACMILLAN: Open the door. I'll add resisting arrest.
DOCTOR: I'd step back, if I were you.
MACMILLAN: I'm charging you too. Aiding and abetting.
DOCTOR: Yes. I'll just step inside this police box and arrest myself.
MACMILLAN: Out, now.
MACMILLAN: No! Come back!
ANGELA: Go on.
CHRISTINA: We could've been so good together.
DOCTOR: Christina, we were.
