The Girl Who Waited
DOCTOR: Apalapucia.
AMY: Say it again?
DOCTOR: Apalapucia.
AMY: Apalapu
DOCTOR: Chia.
RORY: Apalapucia.
DOCTOR: Apalapucia.
AMY: Apalapucia. What a beautiful word.
DOCTOR: Beautiful word, beautiful world. Apalapucia, voted number two planet in the top ten greatest destinations for the discerning intergalactic traveller.
RORY: Why couldn't we go to number one?
DOCTOR: It's hideous. Everyone goes to number one. Planet of the coffee shops. Apalapucia. I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. I give you
RORY: Doors.
DOCTOR: Doors. Yes. I give you doors. But on the other side of those doors, I give you sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades.
AMY: Have you seen my phone?
DOCTOR: Your phone?
AMY: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Your mobile telephone? I bring you to a paradise planet, two billion light years from Earth, and you want to update Twitter.
AMY: Sunsets, spires, soaring silver colonnades. It's a camera phone.
DOCTOR: On the counter, by the DVDs.
AMY: Thank you.
RORY: How do we get in?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Push a button.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rain check on the soaring silver colonnades.
RORY: Yeah. It's a magnifying glass.
AMY : Hey? Hey, it's locked.
RORY: Yeah, push the button.
AMY: Rory?
RORY: Come on, Amy.
AMY: Great.
RORY: Where is she? Where on wherever we are is my wife?
DOCTOR: Rory, I think I've found her.
RORY: What do you mean you've found her? Whoa. No, but, she's not, she's not here.
RORY : I can see her, but she's not here.
AMY : Where am I? In fact, where are you?
RORY: Whoa.
DOCTOR: Hands. Hello, hands. Robot with hands, Rory.
HANDBOT: Welcome to the Twostreams facility. Will you be visiting long?
AMY : Er, Doctor, something's happening.
DOCTOR: Er, Amy? Stay calm. Stay still. Ah, time's gone wobbly. I hate it when it does that.
HANDBOT: Will you be visiting long?
RORY: Good question. Bit sinister. What's the answer to not get us killed?
DOCTOR: It's okay, I've got you, you're fine.
ROBOT : Will you be visiting long?
RORY : Doctor? A little help, Doctor.
AMY: And where have you been?
RORY: What do I tell it?
AMY : I've been here a week.
DOCTOR : A week?
DOCTOR: A week? I'm so sorry. Ah-ha. Same room, different times. Two different timestreams running parallel but at different speeds. Amy, you're in a faster timestream.
AMY: Doctor, it's going again.
RORY: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Amy!
AMY : Doctor!
DOCTOR : Come on. Gotcha. There. Stabilised, settled, shush.
RORY: Why has this got hands?
DOCTOR: Organic skin. Ultimate universal interface, grown and grafted, not born. I mean, it's actually seeing with its fingers, scanning the room. But why not just give it eyes?
HANDBOT: Will you be visiting long?
DOCTOR: As long as it takes.
DOCTOR : Amy, what exactly did you do?
AMY: I just, I came in
AMY : And I pressed the door button.
RORY: Oh.
RORY : Amy, there are two buttons. The green anchor and the red waterfall.
RORY: Which one did you push?
AMY : I pushed the red waterfall.
RORY: Great.
RORY: Amy?
RORY: I pressed Red Waterfall, and she wasn't there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you can't follow her directly. You know, it's never simple. Did you hear that, Handbot? She pressed the wrong button, that's all. We're aliens, we didn't know.
HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Apalapucia is under planet-wide quarantine. This is a kindness facility for those infected with Chen Seven.
DOCTOR: What?
RORY: Chen Seven, hmm?
DOCTOR: The one day plague.
RORY: What, you get it for a day?
DOCTOR: No, you get it, and you die in a day.
HANDBOT: There are forty thousand residents in the Twostreams Facility. Please remain in the sterile areas. Visiting hours are now.
DOCTOR: Sterile area. I'm safe.
AMY: What about me?
DOCTOR: Chen Seven only affects two-hearted races like Apalapucians.
RORY : And Time Lords.
DOCTOR : Yeah, like me. Walk into that facility, I'm dead in a day.
DOCTOR: Time moves faster on Amy's side of the glass.
DOCTOR : Amy, you said you'd been here a week. What did you eat?
AMY : Nothing. I wasn't hungry.
DOCTOR : No, because that Red Waterfall time is compressed. That's the point. The Time Glass syncs up the
DOCTOR: Two timestreams for visits. You could be in here for a day, and watch them live out their entire lives.
RORY: And watch them grow old in front of your eyes?
RORY : That's horrible.
DOCTOR: No, Rory, it's kind. You've got a choice. Sit by their
DOCTOR : Bedside for twenty four hours and watch them die, or sit in here for twenty four hours and watch them live. Which would you choose?
AMY: Doctor? Doctor, no, don't leave me.
DOCTOR: I'm here, Amy. I'm right here.
AMY : Where are you? Am I looking at you?
DOCTOR: Turn left just a fraction. Bit more. Stop. That's it.
AMY : Eye to eye?
DOCTOR: Eye to eye to eye.
RORY: Hello.
DOCTOR: Amy, I'm taking the Time Glass back to the Tardis. Like satnav, I'll use it to get a lock, then smash through using the Tardis to get you out. Until then, you're on your own.
RORY: Er, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Locking it on to Amy. Small act of vandalism. No one'll mind.
DOCTOR: Ah, that'll be the small act of vandalism alarm. Amy, I need you to go into the facility just for a bit. Find somewhere safe and leave me a sign. Remember, you're immune to Chen Seven, but don't let them give you anything. They don't know you're alien. Their kindness will kill you. Now go.
AMY : Rory, I love you. Now save me. Go on.
DOCTOR: This is locked onto Amy permanently. Play the signal into the console, the Tardis'll follow it. Now then, I know you're in here.
DOCTOR: Er, er, ha ha! How do I look?
RORY: Ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Glasses are cool, see?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Hello, handsome man.
RORY: Oh, hello.
DOCTOR: Hello, Rory-cam.
RORY: Huh?
RORY: Oh, you can see what I see.
DOCTOR: We're breaking into Twostreams. Now, I can't go in there. The Chen Seven'll kill me, no regeneration. You will be my eyes and ears.
RORY: Rory-cam. Rescue Amy. Got it.
DOCTOR: That's the spirit. Now, smashing through a timewall could get a bit hairy.
RORY: Is it safe?
DOCTOR: Don't know. Never tried. Best hold onto something.
AMY: What the?
INTERFACE: Welcome to the Twostreams Facility.
AMY: Er, who are you and why can't I see you?
INTERFACE: I am the Interface between yourself and the systems of the Twostreams Facility. I will be your guide, your teacher, your friend.
CHECK IN GIRL: Welcome to Twostreams. What is your name, please?
AMY: Amy. Amy Pond.
CHECK IN GIRL: Welcome, Amy Pond. I see you're travelling alone. As a resident, you will now have access to all of the entertainment zones inside. For a taste of adventure, why not try the mountain zone, and explore Apalapucia's famous Glasmir Mountains. Or try our roller-coaster zone, authentically modelled on the famous Warpspeed Death Ride at Disneyland, Clom. All that you could wish for and more is through the Departure Gate, provided for you with kindness.
INTERFACE: Unexpected visitor. Welcome. Please seek assistance.
AMY: Hello? Hey. Oi, wait.
HANDBOT: You are carrying unregistered bacteria. Please let me help you.
AMY: No, I'm not from this world. Your medicine'll kill me.
HANDBOT: Statement rejected. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
AMY: No, no, please, I hate needles.
HANDBOT: Secondary delivery system engaged.
HANDBOT: Unauthorised infection on check-in, version two two three.
INTERFACE: Unauthorised resident detected.
AMY: Come on.
HANDBOT: This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
INTERFACE: Unauthorised resident detected. Unauthorised resident detected.
AMY: No. No, no.
HANDBOT: This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed.
AMY: Come on, please.
HANDBOT: No residents detected. No residents detected.
AMY: They didn't see me. They didn't see me.
RORY: Red Waterfall. We made it.
DOCTOR: Good old us.
RORY; How do we know that we're in the same Red Waterfall as Amy?
DOCTOR: Focus on the positive.
DOCTOR : We locked onto Amy's timestream.
DOCTOR: Eyes front, soldier.
RORY: Right, yes. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Apalapucians are the great cultural scavengers, Rory. This gallery's a scrapbook of their favourite places.
RORY: Bit of Earth, bit of alien, bit of whatever the hell that is.
AMY: Interface?
INTERFACE: I am here, Amy Pond.
AMY: Shush, shush. Turn that light off. So I'm, what is this? How does it work?
INTERFACE: This is the Gate. From here you may depart to any of Twostreams' entertainment zones.
INTERFACE: Cinema. Aquarium. Garden.
AMY: Garden? Why not?
INTERFACE: Garden.
AMY: That is beautiful. I mean, freaky hedges.
INTERFACE: The perfect replica of a Shill Governor's Mansion on Shallanna.
AMY: You really could spend a lifetime in here. Not that I'm going to. Interface?
INTERFACE: Amy Pond?
AMY: Listen, I need somewhere safe to hide and wait for my friends. Where in Twostreams is safe?
INTERFACE: Twostreams is a safe, nurturing environment.
AMY: You know what I mean. Where can I go so the Handbots can't find me? Okay. Before, I was stood by a sort of vent, and there was light and smoke, and the Handbots couldn't see me. Why not? Okay, I will put it another way. What were those vent thingies?
INTERFACE: The vents channel the exhaust fumes from the Temporal Engines that hold the multiple timestreams in place.
AMY: And these Temporal Engines mess up the Handbots' sensors. So, where's the Temporal Engines?
INTERFACE: Temporal Engines held within.
AMY: Okay.
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
AMY: Ha! Don't like that, do you?
AMY: Temporal engines. Somewhere to hide.
RORY : Where is everyone?
DOCTOR: Right, Rory, switch the Time Glass on and sonic it.
DOCTOR : I'm sending a command signal to the screwdriver. Amy's here somewhere, if I can just get a lock on her.
DOCTOR: I wonder what happens if we mix the filters?
DOCTOR: Oh, there they are. Forty thousand time streams overlapping. Red Waterfall isn't one time stream, it's thousands.
RORY: Are they happy?
DOCTOR: Oh, Rory.
DOCTOR: Trust you to think of that.
DOCTOR : I think they're happy to be alive. Better than the alternative.
RORY: I come in peace. Peace, peace, peace, peace.
WARRIOR: I waited.
RORY: Sorry, what?
WARRIOR: I waited for you. I waited for you.
RORY: Amy.
RORY : Doctor, what's going on?
DOCTOR: Er
RORY: Amy.
DOCTOR : I think the timestream lock might be a bit wobbly.
RORY: No, please. Please.
AMY: Duck.
AMY: Handbots carry a black box in case they go offline. I've changed the cause of termination from hostile to accidental.
AMY : Easy to re-programme. Used my sonic probe.
RORY: Amy.
AMY: Rory.
RORY: Why?
AMY: Because I've survived this long by making the Handbots think I don't exist.
AMY : Don't touch the hands.
AMY: There's anaesthetic transfer on the skin. If they touch you, you go to sleep.
RORY: But you're still here?
AMY: You didn't save me.
RORY: But, this is the saving. This is the us saving you. The Doctor just got the timing a bit out.
DOCTOR : Sorry.
AMY: I've been on my own here a long, long time. I've had decades to think nice thoughts about him. Got a bit harder to stay charitable once I entered decade four.
RORY: Forty years? Alone?
AMY: Thirty six years, thanks.
RORY: No. Right. I mean, you look great. Really, really.
AMY: Eyes front, soldier.
RORY: Still can't win then.
AMY: In fact, I think I can now definitely say I hate him. I hate The Doctor. I hate him more than I've ever hated anyone
AMY : In my life, and you can hear every word of this through those ridiculous glasses, can't you, Raggedy Man?
DOCTOR: Er, yes. Putting the speaker phone on.
AMY : You told me to wait, and I did. A lifetime.
DOCTOR: Amy
AMY : You've got nothing to say to me.
DOCTOR: Amy, behind you.
AMY: Feedback. Knocks them out.
AMY : Learned that trick on my first day.
RORY: Okay, so we just take the Tardis back to the right time stream, yeah?
RORY : We can stop any of this happening.
DOCTOR : We locked on to a timestream, Rory. This is it.
RORY: This is so wrong.
AMY: I got old, Rory. What did you think was going to happen?
RORY: Hey, I don't care that you got old. I care that we didn't grow old together. Amy, come on, please.
AMY: Don't touch me. Don't do that.
RORY: It's like you're not even her.
AMY: Thirty six years, three months, four days of solitary confinement. This facility was built to give people the chance to live.
AMY : I walked in here and I died. Do you have anything to say? Anything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Where did you get a sonic screwdriver?
AMY : I made it. And it's a sonic probe.
RORY: You made a sonic screwdriver?
AMY: Probe.
RORY: Oh.
AMY: Don't worry about him. Sit down, Rory.
RORY: You named him after me?
AMY: Needed a bit of company.
RORY: So he's like your pet? Is it safe?
AMY: Yep. I disarmed it.
RORY: How? Oh, you disarmed it.
AMY: Oh, don't get sentimental, it's just a robot. You'd have done the same.
DOCTOR: I don't know that I would have.
AMY : And there he is. The voice of God. Survive, because no one's going to come for you. Number one lesson.
AMY: You taught me that.
DOCTOR : Is that really all I taught you?
AMY : Don't you lecture me, blue-box man flying through time and space on whimsy. All I've got, all I've had for thirty six years, is cold, hard reality.
AMY: So no, I don't have a sonic screwdriver because I'm not off on a romp. I call it what it is. A probe. And I call my life what it is. Hell.
DOCTOR: Amy Pond, I am going to put this right. You said you learned from an
DOCTOR : Interface. Can I speak with it?
AMY: Doesn't work in here. Two twenty three. The garden'll be clear now. Stay or go?
RORY: Sorry, me? No, I'm coming with you.
AMY: Then try not to get killed. Or do. Whatever.
AMY: When I first came here, I had to trick the Interface into giving me the information, but I've reprogrammed it now. It'll tell me anything except how to escape.
RORY: You hacked it? That's genius.
DOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt that beautiful moment, but temporal engines
DOCTOR: Like that have a regulator valve. Has to be kept at a distance from the main reactor or there'd be feedback. Interface, where's the regulator?
INTERFACE: The regulator valve is held within.
DOCTOR: Oh. Very, very ah.
DOCTOR : Interface, I need to run through some technical specifications.
DOCTOR: Rory, give me to Amy a minute.
RORY: Here you go.
AMY: They look ridiculous.
RORY: That's what I told him. Still, anything beats a fez, eh?
RORY: What is it?
AMY: I think that's the first time I've laughed in thirty six years.
RORY: I'll just, er, leave you two geniuses alone. I'll be back in a minute.
DOCTOR : There's still time, Amy. There's still time to fix everything.
RORY: How can you have a door without a wall?
RORY: Oh. Holographic wallpaper? Oh, sorry. Argh.
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
RORY: Oh.
AMY: Rory?
RORY: Glasses.
AMY: You stupid
RORY: Oh. You saved me.
AMY: Don't get used to it.
RORY: Have you been crying? A little bit.
AMY: Shut up, Rory.
RORY: You have, haven't you?
AMY: Woman with a sword. Don't push it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, here's the plan.
DOCTOR : Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly, but in Twostreams it's extra wobbly.
DOCTOR: I've worked out how to hijack the Temporal Engines and use them to fold two points of Amy's timeline together. We're bringing her out of the then and into the now. Amy, I just need to borrow your brain a minute. It won't hurt, probably. Almost probably and then
DOCTOR : Amy Pond, I'm going to save you.
AMY : No.
AMY: Time's up. Handbots coming.
DOCTOR : Amy, you've got to help us help you. I need you to think back
DOCTOR: Thirty six years ago. Amy? Amy!
RORY: You told her to leave us a sign.
RORY : And she did. And she waited.
RORY: Oh Amy, why won't you help yourself?
AMY: He wants to rescue past me from thirty six years back, which means I'll cease to exist. Everything I've seen and done dissolves. Time is rewritten.
RORY: That's, that's good, isn't it? 
AMY: I will die. Another Amy will take my place. An Amy who never got trapped at Twostreams, an Amy who grew old with you, and she, in thirty six years, won't be me.
RORY: But you'll die in here!
AMY: Not if you take me with you.
AMY : You came to rescue me, so rescue me.
RORY: Leave her and take you?
DOCTOR: We could take this Amy with us, easy, but if we do, our Amy has to wait thirty six years to be rescued.
RORY: So I have to choose. Which wife do I want?
AMY: She is me. We're both me.
RORY: You being here is wrong. For a single day, an hour, let alone a lifetime. I swore to protect you. I promised.
DOCTOR: Rory
RORY: This is your fault.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, but, Rory
RORY: No, this is your fault! You should look in a history book once in a while, see if there's an outbreak of
RORY : Plague or not.
DOCTOR: That is not how I travel.
RORY: Then I do not want to travel with you!
DOCTOR : Rory, is the Time Glass still on? If the link's still active, I think I can hear Amy. Our Amy.
RORY: Oh, Amy.
RORY: Look me in the face and say you won't help her.
AMY: I will not help her.
RORY: Okay, okay. Look me in the face and say it now.
AMY : Rory? Rory is that you?
AMY: Rory, where are you?
RORY : Same place as you, and a bit ahead.
OLDER AMY: I remember this.
AMY : But who's she? There's no one else here but. Me?
AMY: Why are we still here?
OLDER AMY: Because they leave you. Because they get in their Tardis and they fly away.
AMY: No. Rory wouldn't, not ever. Something must have stopped him.
OLDER AMY: You did. Or rather, the old version of you.
OLDER AMY : The me version of you. I refuse to help them. I won't let them save myself.
AMY: Why?
OLDER AMY: If you escape, then I was never trapped here. The last thirty six years of my life rewrites, and I cease to exist. That's why old me refused to help then. That's why I'm refusing to help now. And that's why you'll refuse to help when it's your turn. And nothing you can say will change that.
AMY: Three words. What about Rory?
OLDER AMY : Rory?
OLDER AMY: I called my robot Rory.
AMY : You called your robot Rory?
AMY: Oh, so you didn't call it the Doctor, or Biggles
AMY : Our favourite cat?
OLDER AMY: Do you, er, do you
OLDER AMY : Remember that summer when he came back to school with that ridiculous haircut?
AMY: He said he'd been in a rock band.
OLDER AMY: Liar. And, and then he had to learn to play the guitar.
AMY: So we wouldn't know he couldn't play it. Mmm hmm.
OLDER AMY: All those boys chasing me, but it was only ever Rory. Why was that?
AMY: You know when sometimes you meet someone so beautiful
AMY : And then you actually talk to them, and five minutes later they're as dull as a brick?
AMY: Then there's other people, and you meet them and think, not bad, they're okay. And then you get to know them, and their face just sort of becomes them, like their personality's written all over it. And they just turn into something so beautiful.
BOTH: Rory's the most beautiful man I've ever met.
AMY: Please? Do it for him.
OLDER AMY: You're asking me to defy destiny, causality, the nexus of time itself, for a boy.
AMY: You're Amy, he's Rory, and oh yes, I am.
OLDER AMY: I am going to pull time apart for you.
OLDER AMY : Okay, Doctor, Twostreams is back on air. Right, okay, so this is big news.
OLDER AMY: This is temporal earthquake time. I am now officially changing my own future. Hold on to your spectacles. In my past, I saw my future self refuse to help you. I'm now changing that future and
OLDER AMY : Agreeing. Every law of time says that shouldn't be possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, except sometimes knowing your own future's what enables you to change it. Especially if you're bloody minded, contradictory
DOCTOR : And completely unpredictable.
RORY: So basically, if you're Amy, then?
DOCTOR : Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny,
DOCTOR: It's your wife.
OLDER AMY: It's not about what I'm doing, but who I'm doing it for. I'm trusting you to watch my back, Rory.
RORY: Always. You and me, always.
OLDER AMY: Because here's the deal. You take me, too. In the Tardis. Me too.
RORY: But that means that there'll be two of you.
RORY : Permanently. Forever.
OLDER AMY : And that way we both get to live.
RORY: Two Amys together. Can that work?
DOCTOR : I don't know.
DOCTOR: It's your marriage.
RORY: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Perhaps. Maybe, if I shunted the reality compensators on the Tardis, re-calibrated the Doomsday bumpers and jettisoned the karaoke bar, yes. Maybe. Yes. It could do it. The Tardis could sustain the paradox.
RORY: Right. Amy and Amy.
RORY: The wife and the wife. Right. Right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Amy, Past Amy, stand by the door. Future Amy, you too.
DOCTOR : Future Amy, can I borrow your sonic scr
DOCTOR: Probe.
OLDER AMY: It's a screwdriver.
DOCTOR : Rory, sonic it. Double our power. Amy Now, you're our link to Amy Then.
DOCTOR: We need to get a signal through, and that signal
DOCTOR : Will be a thought.
DOCTOR: Amy Now and Amy Then, share a thought. Something so
DOCTOR: Powerful that it can rip through time. Rory
DOCTOR: Sonic the plinth front. Inside you'll find
DOCTOR : Three levers and a jumble of wiring.
DOCTOR: That's the regulator valve. After we re-route it, you have ten minutes to get back to the Tardis.
RORY: Okay.
DOCTOR: Pull out the red and green receptors. Re-route the blue into the red and
DOCTOR : The green into blue. Leave the red loose and on no account
DOCTOR: Touch anything yellow. Come on, Rory. It's hardly rocket science. It's just
DOCTOR: Quantum physics.
RORY: Yes, right. Blue into red and then green
DOCTOR : Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, the levers.
DOCTOR: Throw them in order.
DOCTOR : And Amys, start thinking the most important thought you have ever had.
DOCTOR: Hold it in your head and do not let it go. Lever one.
BOTH AMYS: Macarena. Macarena.
RORY: She's doing the Macarena.
BOTH AMYS: Macarena. Macarena.
RORY: Our first kiss.
DOCTOR: Lever two, Rory. Lever three.
RORY: Oh, Amy.
AMY: Oh, my God.
OLDER AMY: Oh, my God.
RORY: Sorry.
OLDER AMY: Hello.
AMY: Hello.
BOTH: I don't know what to
RORY: Weird.
BOTH: Okay, this is weird. Right, just stop doing that.
RORY: How about Amy One speaks first?
BOTH: Which one's Amy One?
RORY: Well
BOTH: I am. No, I am. Rory? Rory, just stop doing that.
DOCTOR: Rory. Rory, take the glasses off. You're getting temporal feedback.
DOCTOR: Whoa! Calm down, dear. Rory, Amy, we've created a massive paradox and the Tardis hates it. She's self-phasing, trying to get out of here. What's the nasty Amy done to you. Just calm down, dear. Hang on in there. Rory, you've got eight minutes left. I'm sorry, you're on your own now.
RORY: I'm not on my own. I've got my wives.
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed.
RORY: Incoming!
HANDBOT: This is a kindness.
OLDER AMY: With me.
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed, this is a kindness. This is a kindness.
OLDER AMY: Amy, Kate Hayler, year ten hockey.
AMY: Go for the shins.
HANDBOT: This is a kindness.
RORY: They're cutting off the Departure Gate. We can't get back to the Tardis.
OLDER AMY: Side door. We'll go behind them.
AMY: So you think you're going to come with us, just like that.
OLDER AMY: Yeah, just like that.
AMY: Rory, talk to her.
OLDER AMY: Rory, talk to her.
RORY: Now, ladies
AMY: Where are you going to live?
OLDER AMY: Not with you, don't worry. I'll go travelling. Pop back for Christmas, maybe Easter.
RORY: Amy, you always say, cooking Christmas dinner, you wish there was two of you.
RORY: Can't we just teleport in?
OLDER AMY: It's not a teleport, it's a time jump.
AMY: They can't shunt within the same timestream.
OLDER AMY: Yes.
RORY: The Tardis is in the Gallery.
INTERFACE: Gallery closed.
OLDER AMY: The controls are stuck. They've locked them from outside.
RORY: Can you unlock them?
OLDER AMY: Yeah, give me a minute and your cutest smile. That's the one.
RORY: Can you stop flirting with me. You're old enough to be my
OLDER AMY: I've known you my whole life. How many games of Doctors And Nurses? Shush. Don't get coy now.
AMY: Er
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness. Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
OLDER AMY: No!
RORY: Come on.
OLDER AMY: Go! I've got your back.
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.
RORY: No!
DOCTOR: Ah, it's just an anaesthetic. She'll be fine.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
RORY: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: I lied to her, Rory. There can never be two Amys in the Tardis. The paradox is too massive.
RORY: You can't leave her. She'll die.
OLDER AMY: Doctor, let me in.
DOCTOR: No, she'll never have existed. When we save our Amy, this future won't have happened.
RORY: But she happened. She's there.
OLDER AMY : I trusted you!
DOCTOR: No, she's not real.
RORY: She is real. Let her in.
DOCTOR: Look, we take this Amy, we leave ours. Only one Amy in the Tardis. Which one do you want?
DOCTOR: It's your choice.
RORY: This isn't fair. You're turning me into you.
DOCTOR: Your choice, Rory.
RORY: I, er
OLDER AMY : Doctor? Doctor! Doctor? Doctor?
OLDER AMY: Rory, please.
OLDER AMY: The look on your face when you carried her. Me. Her.
OLDER AMY : When you carried her away. You used to look at me like that.
OLDER AMY: I'd forgotten how much you loved me. I'd forgotten how much I loved being her. Amy Pond, in the Tardis, with Rory Williams.
RORY: I'm sorry, I can't do this.
OLDER AMY: If you love me, don't let me in. Open that door, I will, I'll come in. I don't want to die. I won't bow out bravely.
OLDER AMY : I'll be kicking and screaming, fighting.
OLDER AMY: To the end.
RORY: Amy. Amy, I love you.
OLDER AMY: I love you, too. Don't let me in. Tell Amy, your Amy, I'm giving her the days. The days with you. The days to come.
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.
OLDER AMY: The days I can't have. Take them, please.
OLDER AMY : I'm giving you my days.
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.

OLDER AMY: Interface?
INTERFACE: I am here, Amy Pond.
OLDER AMY: Show me Earth. Show me home. Did I ever tell you about this boy I met there, who pretended to be in a band?
RORY: Did you always know it would never work? Saving both Amys?
DOCTOR: I promised you I'd save her, and there she is. Safe.
RORY: Yeah, there she is.
DOCTOR: I'll leave you two alone.
RORY: You all right?
AMY: Mmm hmm.
RORY: How are you feeling?
AMY: Where is she?
