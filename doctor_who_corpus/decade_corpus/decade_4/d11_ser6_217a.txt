The Rebel Flesh
JIMMY: Lights.
JIMMY: Lights. You know the drill, people. Plastic visors down and locked. Buzzer?
JENNIFER: Reading of nine point seven.
JIMMY: Sounds a bit low for unrefined. How's the average?
JENNIFER: The acid potency stats have definitely dropped below the mean during the last quarter.
BUZZER: Prettier than a computer, isn't she?
JENNIFER: Give over, Buzz.
JENNIFER: Buzzer. Buzz.
JIMMY: Oh, great. Nice going, twinkle toes.
JENNIFER: I shouldn't have swung at him. Sorry, Buzz. My bad.
BUZZER: No, you're all right. Jimmy?
JIMMY: Well, no point carrying you back legless. Sorry, Buzzer. You're dead.
BUZZER: Well, this is a right pain in the armour. Heart's gone now.
JIMMY: Look, we'd best get off. Got to write this one up for the boss. Those suits cost a bomb. If I miss my boy's birthday filling out forms, I'll kill you again.
JIMMY: Lights.
JENNIFER: I'm looking at these readings, Jimmy, and the potency stats are way too low. We may have to take that read again. This thing is still jamming up on me.
BUZZER: So I think we'd better talk about what just happened back there. I could get compensation. I've seen the holo-ads. Had an accident in the workplace? Yeah, I have as it goes. I melted.
JIMMY: Let it go.
BUZZER: Just remember. When you're doing your report, it wasn't my fault. She took a swing at me.
JENNIFER: I never touched you. You've got two left feet, Buzzer.
BUZZER: I haven't got two left feet. Or any arms, neck, head, the chin. This body costs money, love.
JIMMY: Not as much as that acid suit.
BUZZER: Oh, lighten up. It's not like anyone was hurt.
AMY: Forty six. Rubbishy, rubbishy, rubbish.
RORY: Hello? It's a double top.
AMY: Wrong side of the wire, mister.
RORY: You're on the oche, Red.
DOCTOR: Who wants fish and chips?
DOCTOR: I'll drop you both off. Take your time. Don't rush.
RORY: Er, and you? Things to do. Things involving other things.
AMY: Well, we'll stay with you. We'll do the other things.
DOCTOR: Nope.
AMY: Whatever you're up to, I'd personally like to be a part of it. What?
DOCTOR: Solar tsunami. Came directly from your sun. A tidal wave of radiation. Big, big, big.
RORY: Oh Doctor, my tummy's going funny.
DOCTOR: Well, the gyrator disconnected. Target tracking is out.
DOCTOR: Assume the position!
DOCTOR: Textbook landing.
DOCTOR: Behold, a cockerel! Love a cockerel.
DOCTOR: And underneath, a monastery. Thirteenth century.
AMY: Oh, we've gone all mediaeval.
RORY: I'm not sure about that.
AMY: Really? Mediaeval expert are you?
RORY: No, it's just that I can hear Dusty Springfield.
DOCTOR: These fissures are new. Solar tsunami sent out a huge wave of gamma particles. This is caused by a magnetic quake that occurs just before the wave hits.
AMY: Well, the monastery's standing.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for now.
RORY: Doctor, look.
DOCTOR: Yeah. It's a supply pipe. Ceramic inner lining. Something corrosive. They're pumping something nasty off this island to the mainland.
RORY: My mum's a massive fan of Dusty Springfield.
DOCTOR: Who isn't? Right, let's go. Satisfy our rabid curiosity.
AMY: So where are these Dusty Springfield loving monks, then?
DOCTOR: I think we're here. This is it.
RORY: Doctor, what are you talking about? We've never been here before.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
AMY: We came here by accident?
DOCTOR: Accident? Yes, I know. Accident.
RORY: Ow!
DOCTOR: Acid. They're pumping acid off this island. That's old stuff. Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger.
TANNOY: Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
DOCTOR: There are people coming. Well, almost.
AMY: Almost coming?
DOCTOR: Almost people.
RORY: I think we should really be going.
AMY: Come on!
RORY: I'm telling you. When something runs towards you, it is never for a nice reason.
AMY: What are all these harnesses for?
RORY: The almost people?
AMY: What are they, prisoners, or are they meditating, or what?
DOCTOR: Well, at the moment they fall into the or what category.
TANNOY: Halt and remain calm.
DOCTOR: Well, we've halted. How are we all doing on the calm front?
JIMMY: Don't move!
BUZZER: Stay back, Jen. We don't know who they are.
JENNIFER: So let's ask them. Who the hell are you?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor, and this is Amy and Rory, and it's all very nice, isn't it?
AMY: Hold up. You're all. What are you all? Like identical twins?
CLEAVES: This is an Alpha Grade industrial facility. Unless you work for the military or for Morpeth Jetson, you are in big trouble.
DOCTOR: Actually, you're in big trouble.
CLEAVES: Meteorological Department? Since when?
DOCTOR: Since you were hit by a solar wave.
CLEAVES: Which we survived.
DOCTOR: Just, by the look of it. And there's a bigger one on the way.
CLEAVES: Which we'll also survive. Dicken, scan for bugs.
BUZZER: Backs against the wall. Now.
DOCTOR: You're not a monastery, you're a factory. Twenty second century army-owned factory.
AMY: You're army?
CLEAVES: No, love. We're contractors, and you're trespassers.
DICKEN: It's clear, boss.
CLEAVES: All right, weatherman, your ID checks out. If there's another solar storm, what are you going to do about it? Hand out sunblock?
DOCTOR: I need to see your critical systems.
CLEAVES: Which one?
DOCTOR: You know which one.
DOCTOR: And there you are.
CLEAVES: Meet the government's worst kept secret. The Flesh. It's fully programmable matter. In fact, it's even learning to replicate itself at the cellular level.
AMY: Right. Brilliant. Lost.
CLEAVES: Okay. Once a reading's been taken, we can manipulate its molecular structure into anything. Replicate a living organism down to the hairs on its chinny chin chin. Even clothes. And everything's identical. Eyes, voice
DOCTOR: Mind, soul?
CLEAVES: Don't be fooled, Doctor. It acts like life but it still needs to be controlled by us, from those harnesses you saw.
RORY: Wait, whoa. Hold it. So, you're Flesh now?
CLEAVES: I'm lying in a harness back in that chamber. We all are, except Jennifer here. Don't be scared. This thing, just like operating a forklift truck.
DOCTOR: You said it could grow. Only living things grow.
CLEAVES: Moss grows. It's no more than that. This acid is so dangerous we were losing a worker every week. So now we mine the acid using these doppelgangers. Or Gangers. If these bodies get burnt or fall in the acid
BUZZER: Then who the hell cares, right, Jen?
JENNIFER: Nerve endings automatically cut off like airbags being discharged. We wake up and get a new Ganger.
JIMMY: It's weird, but you get used to it.
CLEAVES: Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger. Get back to the harness.
BUZZER: Hang on, what's he up to? What you up to, pal?
DOCTOR: Stop it. Strange. It was like for a moment there it was scanning me.
CLEAVES: Doctor.
CLEAVES: Get back, Doctor. Leave it alone.
DOCTOR: I understand.
AMY: Doctor? Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Incredible. You have no idea. No idea. I mean, I felt it in my mind. I reached out to it, and it to me.
CLEAVES: Don't fiddle with the money, Doctor.
DOCTOR: How can you be so blinkered? It's alive. So alive. You're piling your lives, your personalities directly into it.
DOCTOR: It's the solar storm. The first waves come in pairs. Pre-shock and fore-shock. It's close.
CLEAVES: Buzzer, we got anything from the mainland yet?
BUZZER: No, the comms are still too jammed with radiation.
CLEAVES: Okay. Then we'll keep pumping acid until the mainland says stop. Now why don't you stand back and let us impress you?
COMPUTER: ID confirmed. Jennifer Lucas.
JENNIFER: The meter is running.
JENNIFER: Cardio and respiratory online. Motor functions online. Plumbing in.
DOCTOR: Well, I can see why you keep it in a church. Miracle of life.
BUZZER: No need to get poncey. It's just gunge.
CLEAVES: Guys, we need to get to work.
JIMMY: Okay, everybody, let's crack on.
DOCTOR: Did I mention the solar storm? You need to get out of here.
JIMMY: Where do you want us to go? We're on a tiny island.
DOCTOR: Well, I can get you all off it.
CLEAVES: Don't be ridiculous. We've got a job to do.
DOCTOR: It's coming.
JENNIFER: That's the alarm.
DOCTOR: How do you get power?
CLEAVES: We're solar. We use a solar router. The weathervane.
DOCTOR: Big problem.
JIMMY: Boss, maybe if the storm's back we should get underground. The factory's seen better days. The acid pipes might not withstand another hit.
CLEAVES: We have two hundred tons of acid to pump out. We fall behind, we stay another rotation. Anyone want that?
DOCTOR: Please, you are making a massive mistake here. You're right at the crossroads of it. Don't turn the wrong way. If you don't, if you don't prepare for this storm, you are all in terrible danger. Understand?
CLEAVES: My factory, my rules.
DOCTOR: I need to check the progress of the storm. Monitoring station? Monitoring station.
JENNIFER: Three lefts, a right and a left. Third door on your left.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Waves disturbing the Earth's magnetic field. There is going to be the mother and father of all power surges. See this weathervane, the cock-a-doodle-do? It's a solar router feeding the whole factory with solar power. When that wave hits, ka-boom. I've to get to that cockerel before all hell breaks loose. I never thought I'd have to say that again. Amy, breathe.
AMY: Yeah! I mean, thanks. I'll try.
RORY: Oh. For want of a better word, ow!
DOCTOR: Cleaves, you're not in your harness.
CLEAVES: I'm sorry, Doctor. You were right.
DOCTOR: You've lost all power to the factory.
CLEAVES: Doctor, I abandoned my team.
DOCTOR: Then let's go get them.
DOCTOR: How long would you say we were unconscious for, Cleaves?
CLEAVES: Not long. A minute, two minutes?
DOCTOR: I'd hazard we've been out a teensy bit longer.
CLEAVES: Well, how long?
DOCTOR: An hour. I've seen whole worlds turned inside out in an hour. A lot can go wrong in an hour.
BUZZER: I feel like I been toasted.
JIMMY: What the hell happened?
AMY: The tsunami happened. You hurt?
JIMMY: It feels like the National Grid's run through my bones but apart from that
BUZZER: I hope the meter's not bust. I still want to get paid.
RORY: Jennifer! Jennifer. Hey, all right?
JENNIFER: It hurt so much.
RORY: Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's over.
JENNIFER: I couldn't get out of my harness.
RORY: Shush.
JENNIFER: I thought I was going to die.
RORY: Welcome to my world.
AMY: Doctor, these are all real people, so where are their Gangers?
CLEAVES: Don't worry. When the link shuts down the Gangers return to pure Flesh. Now, the storm's left us with acid leaks all over, so we need to contact the mainland. They can have a rescue shuttle out here in no time.
JIMMY: That's my record. Who's playing my record?
DOCTOR: Your Gangers. They've gone walkabout.
CLEAVES: No, it's impossible. They're not active. Cars don't fly themselves, cranes don't lift themselves and Gangers don't
BUZZER: No way.
CLEAVES: I don't, I don't believe this.
JIMMY: They could've escaped through the service door at the back.
BUZZER: This is just like the Isle of Sheppey.
DOCTOR: It would seem the storm has animated your Gangers.
CLEAVES: They've ransacked everything.
DOCTOR: Not ransacked, searched.
CLEAVES: Through our stuff!
DOCTOR: Their stuff.
JIMMY: Searching for what?
DOCTOR: Confirmation. They need to know their memories are real.
BUZZER: Oh, so they've got flaming memories now.
DOCTOR: They feel compelled to connect to their lives.
CLEAVES: Their stolen lives.
DOCTOR: No, bequeathed. You gave them this. You poured in your personalities, emotions, traits, memories, secrets, everything. You gave them your lives. Human lives are amazing. Are you surprised they walked off with them?
BUZZER: I'll say it again. Isle of Sheppey. Ganger got an electric shock, toddled off, killed his operator right there in his harness. I've seen the photos. This bloke's ear was all hanging
JIMMY: Even if this has actually happened, they can't remain stable without us plumbed in to them, can they, boss.
CLEAVES: Guess we'll find out.
RORY: Are you okay? Do you need some water?
JENNIFER: I feel funny. I need the washroom.
RORY: I'll come with you.
DICKEN: Sorry.
AMY: Oh! Okay.
BUZZER: That's me. It's good to have a hobby. So what, my Ganger did that all on its own?
DOCTOR: Who taught you to do this?
BUZZER: My granddad.
DOCTOR: Well, your Ganger's granddad taught him to do it, too. You both have the same childhood memories, just as clear, just as real.
BUZZER: No.
DOCTOR: Scared, disorientated, struggling to come to terms with an entire life in their heads.
RORY: The Doctor's always saying don't wander off. First rule with him, actually. Don't wander off.
JENNIFER: I just need a minute.
RORY: Oh, yeah. Sure. Take all the time you need. I've got your back. You're fine.
RORY: Er, Jennifer? What's up, Jennifer?
We er, we'd better get going. Everything okay in there, Jen?
JENNIFER: Just let us live.
JIMMY: We need to protect ourselves.
DOCTOR: Are you a violent man, Jimmy?
JIMMY: No.
DOCTOR: Then why would the other Jimmy be?
CLEAVES: Don't tell me you can eat at a time like this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You told me we were out cold for a few minutes, Cleaves, when in fact it was an hour.
CLEAVES: Sorry, I just assumed
DOCTOR: Well, it's not your fault. Like I said, they're disoriented. Amy, when you got to the alcoves, who was in harness?
AMY: Jimmy and Dicken were helping Buzzer out.
DOCTOR: Jennifer?
AMY: She was standing on her own when we got to her.
DOCTOR: It's hot.
DOCTOR: Trans-matter's still a little rubbery. Nerve endings not quite fused properly.
CLEAVES: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: It's okay.
CLEAVES: Why didn't I feel that?
DOCTOR: You will. You'll stabilise.
CLEAVES: No, stop it. You're playing stupid games. Stop it!
DOCTOR: You don't have to hide. Please, trust me. I'm the Doctor.
BUZZER: Where's the real Cleaves, you thing? What have you done with her?
DOCTOR: That's it. Good, you remember. This is early Flesh. The early stages of the technology. So much to learn.
AMY: Doctor, what's happened to her?
DOCTOR: She can't stabilise. She's shifting between half-formed and full-formed, for now at least.
CLEAVES: We are living.
DOCTOR: Let her go.
AMY: Doctor, Rory.
DOCTOR: Rory?
AMY: Rory!
DOCTOR: Oh, Rory. Rory! Always with the Rory.
JIMMY: Explosion must've ruptured the acid feeds. We're going to need the acid suits.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. We haven't got time. Back, back, back!
JENNIFER : Rory? Rory? Rory?
AMY: Rory.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jennifer's a Ganger too.
AMY: Doctor, you said they wouldn't be violent.
DOCTOR: But I did say they were scared and angry.
JIMMY: And early technology, is what you said. You seem to know something about the Flesh.
AMY: Do you? Doctor?
JIMMY: You're no weatherman. Why are you really here?
DOCTOR: I have to talk to them. I can fix this.
JIMMY: Wait. What's going on? Where's the real Jennifer?
DOCTOR: It is too dangerous out here with acid leaks.
AMY: We have to find Rory.
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm going back to the Tardis. Wait for me in the dining hall. I want us to keep together, okay. No more wandering off.
AMY: And what about Rory?
DOCTOR: Well, it would be safer to look for Rory and Jennifer with the Tardis.
JIMMY: Here we go. Distress flares.
DOCTOR: Exit?
JIMMY: Keep going straight. Can't miss it. But you're never going to get your vehicle in here.
DOCTOR: I'm a great parker.
JIMMY: We really need those acid suits. I've sent Buzzer and Dicken to get them.
AMY: Fine and dandy. I'm just going to find my husband, so cheers.
JIMMY: Amy, I wouldn't.
AMY: Nor would I. What can you do, eh?
JIMMY: At least wait for an acid suit.
G-JENNIFER: When I was a little girl, I got lost on the moors, wandered off from the picnic. I can still feel how sore my toes got inside my red welly boots. And I imagined another little girl, just like me, in red wellies, and she was Jennifer too. Except she was a strong Jennifer, a tough Jennifer. She'd lead me home. My name is Jennifer Lucas. I am not a factory part. I had toast for my breakfast. I wrote a letter to my mum. And then you arrived. I noticed your eyes right off.
RORY: Did you?
G-JENNIFER: Nice eyes. Kind.
RORY: Where is the real Jennifer?
G-JENNIFER: I am Jennifer Lucas. I remember everything that happened in her entire life. Every birthday, every childhood illness. I feel everything she has ever felt and more. I'm not a monster! I am me. Me! Me! Me!
G-JENNIFER: Why did they do this to us? Help me, Rory. Help me.
RORY: Shush, shush.
LIPS: Trust me.
DOCTOR: Oh. What are you doing down there?
BUZZER: Clear.
BUZZER: Those damn Gangers got to the acid suits.
DICKEN: There is acid leaking everywhere. Did you see the boss' eyes back there in the hall?
BUZZER: I've never seen a Ganger look at me like that.
DICKEN: I don't know what they are now, but they ain't us.
G-CLEAVES: We have the advantage now. We have the acid suits. We can move freely. Strike at will.
RORY: Are you sure you're feeling better? No more super-elastic punches?
G-JENNIFER: I'm different now. Stronger.
RORY: The Doctor won't hurt you. He wants to help, Jennifer, okay?
G-JENNIFER: You used my name. You used my name. Thank you.
G-JENNIFER: Amy's a lucky girl.
RORY: Yeah, she is. Let's go.
AMY: Rory. Rory?
RORY: Amy!
AMY: You're okay. What happened?
RORY: She needs protecting.
BUZZER: Jen?
AMY: No, it's a Ganger. Rory, listen.
RORY: Look, you listen. Nobody touches her.
DOCTOR: Hello. How are you all getting on?
G-CLEAVES: Why don't you tell us?
DOCTOR: Well, we have two choices. The first is to tear each other apart. Not my favourite. The second is to knuckle down and work together. Try to work out how best we can help you.
DOCTOR: Now, I know its hard for you to hold your fully human form. That's why you keep shifting between the Flesh stages, but do try. It'll make the others less scared of you.
BUZZER: Where's Jen? What have you done with her?
G-JENNIFER: I haven't seen her, I swear. But look, I'm her. I'm just like her. I'm real.
JIMMY: You're a copy. You're just pretending to be like her.
AMY: Rory, we don't really know anything about them yet.
RORY: Well, I know that she's afraid and she needs our help.
G-JENNIFER: Jimmy, Buzzer. Come on, you guys. We've worked together for two years.
BUZZER: I worked with Jennifer Lucas, not you.
AMY: Okay, let's not do anything at all
AMY + DOCTOR: Until the Doctor gets here. Hello.
JIMMY: This is
G-JIMMY: You're telling me.
G-CLEAVES: All right, Doctor, you've brought us together. Now what?
DOCTOR: Before we do anything, I have one very important question. Has anybody got a pair of shoes I could borrow? Size ten. Although I should warn you, I have very wide feet.
CLEAVES: That's it, Doctor befriend them. Team up with them, why don't you? Make a football team. How about that? You're going to have us all together singing campfire songs.
DOCTOR: The Flesh was never merely moss. These are not copies. The storm has hardwired them. They are becoming people.
JIMMY: With souls?
DICKEN: Rubbish! Achoo.
DOCTOR: Bless you. We were all jelly once. Little jelly eggs sitting in goop.
AMY: Yeah, thanks. Too much information.
DOCTOR: We are not talking about an accident that needs to be mopped up. We are talking about sacred life. Do you understand? Good. Now, the Tardis is trapped in an acid pool. Once I can reach her, I can get you all off this island, humans and Gangers, eh? How does that sound?
JIMMY: Can I make it home for Adam's birthday?
G-JIMMY: What about me? He's my son too.
JIMMY: You? You really think that?
G-JIMMY: I feel it.
JIMMY: Oh, so you were there when he was born, were you?
G-JIMMY: Yeah. I drank about eight pints of tea, then they told me I had a wee boy and I just burst out laughing. No idea why. I miss home, as much as you.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's a right old mess, this. But as you might say up North, oh well, I'll just go to't foot of stairs. Eee by by gum. Or not. Good. Right. First step is we get everyone together, then get everyone safe. Then, get everyone out of here.
AMY: But we're still missing Jennifer and Cleaves.
JIMMY: I'll go and look for them.
G-JIMMY: I'll give you a hand, if you like. Cover more ground.
JIMMY: Yeah, okay. Thanks.
CLEAVES: This circus has gone on long enough.
G-CLEAVES: Oh, great. You see, that is just so typically me.
CLEAVES: Doctor, tell it to shut up!
DOCTOR: Cleaves, no. No, no.
CLEAVES: Circuit probe. Fires about ooo, forty thousand volts? Would kill any one of us, so I guess she'll work on Gangers just the same.
DOCTOR: It's interesting you refer to them as it, but you call a glorified cattle prod a she.
CLEAVES: When the real people are safely off this island, then I'll happily talk philosophy over a pint with you, Doctor.
AMY: What are you going to do to them?
CLEAVES: Sorry. They're monsters. Mistakes. They have to be destroyed.
DOCTOR: Give me the probe, Cleaves.
CLEAVES: We always have to take charge, don't we, Miranda. Even when we don't really know what the hell is going on.
DOCTOR: Argh! He's dead!
CLEAVES: We call it decommissioned.
DOCTOR: You stopped his heart. He had a heart. Aorta, valves, a real human heart. And you stopped it.
RORY: Jen?
G-JENNIFER: What happened to Buzzer will happen to all of us if we trust you.
DOCTOR: Wait, wait, just wait.
RORY: No!
AMY: You idiot!
DOCTOR: Wait! Look at what you have done, Cleaves.
CLEAVES: If it's war, then it's war. You don't get it, Doctor. How can you? It's us and them now. Us and them.
DICKEN: Us and them.
JIMMY:  Us and them.
G-JENNIFER: You tried. We all tried and look what they did. Us and them now.
G-JIMMY: Us and them.
G-DICKEN: Us and them.
G-CLEAVES: Jennifer.
G-JENNIFER: Buzzer warned you it was a trick and now he's dead. If we want to live, then it's time to go to war. I'll take care of the spare one running around out there.
VOICE: Trust me.
RORY: Look, I just wanted to help her.
AMY: Well, we all do, okay?
RORY: Don't be like that. Listen, she's
AMY: I said I agree with you. Drop it.
DOCTOR: The most fortified and defendable room in the monastery. Cleaves, the most fortified and defendable room in the monastery.
CLEAVES: The chapel.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
CLEAVES: Only one way in. Stone walls two feet thick.
DOCTOR: You've crossed one hell of a line, Cleaves. You've killed one of them. They're coming back, in a big way.
RORY : Jennifer!
JENNIFER: Rory?
JIMMY: What about the flares?
DOCTOR: We'll worry about the flares when we're locked inside. Rory, Pond.
AMY: Rory, come on.
RORY: Jen's out there. She's out there and she's on her own.
DOCTOR: Well, if she's got any sense, then she's hiding. Rory!
RORY: I can't leave her out there!
DOCTOR: Rory.
RORY: I know you understand that.
AMY: Get in here. Get in here!
G-CLEAVES: There they are.
DOCTOR: Amy.
AMY: Rory!
DOCTOR: Amy, they are not after him, they're after us.
VOICE : Why? Why?
DOCTOR: Show yourself. Show yourself!
RORY: Jennifer?
AMY: Doctor!
CLEAVES: Pass me the barrel.
DICKEN: We need something heavy. Anything you can find.
JIMMY: This is insane. We're fighting ourselves.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's insane, and it's about to get even more insanerer. Is that a word? Show yourself, right now!
AMY: Doctor, we are trapped in here and Rory's out there with them. Hello? We can't get to the Tardis and we can't even leave the island.
G-DOCTOR: Correct in every respect, Pond. It's frightening, unexpected, frankly a total, utter splattering mess on the carpet, but I am certain, one hundred percent certain, that we can work this out. Trust me. I'm the Doctor.
