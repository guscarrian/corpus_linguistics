Night Terrors
CLAIRE: Bed.
GEORGE: But Mum
CLAIRE: George, I won't tell you again. Get into bed. I'm going to be late for work. It's just the lift, love. How many more times?
GEORGE: Don't like it.
CLAIRE: Well, what do we do with the things we don't like? We
BOTH: Put them in the cupboard.
GEORGE: The thing. You have to do the thing, Mum.
GEORGE: Five times. It has to be five times.
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters.
CLAIRE: All right now? Come on, George. There's nothing to be scared of. Night, night then, love.
ALEX: How is he?
CLAIRE: He's in bed at least.
ALEX: I'm worried about him. Why's he terrified all the time?
CLAIRE: He needs help.
ALEX: He's got us.
CLAIRE: He needs a doctor.
GEORGE : Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters.
DOCTOR: Please save me from the monsters. Haven't done this in a while.
AMY: Haven't done what? What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Making a house call.
RORY: No offence, Doctor
DOCTOR: Meaning the opposite.
RORY: But we could get a bus somewhere like this.
DOCTOR: The exact opposite.
AMY: Well, I suppose it can't all be planets and history and stuff, Rory.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can. Course it can. Planets and history and stuff. That's what we do. But not today. No. Today, we're answering a cry for help from the scariest place in the universe. A child's bedroom.
RORY: Please save me from the monsters? Who sent that?
DOCTOR: That's what we're here to find out.
AMY: Sounds like something a kid would say.
DOCTOR: Exactly. A scared kid. A very scared kid. So scared that somehow its cry for help got through to us in the Tardis.
AMY: Yeah, but you've traced it here.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Ah. Going up.
TELEVISION: Now, did you know there that there are twice as many pets as people here in the UK? Now that's a lot of animals and we want to know how clever they are. Now, if you were watching BBC1 on Saturday night, you will have seen Rolf Harris and Kate Humble
AMY: Hi.
DOCTOR: Hello.
AMY: Are your mummy and daddy in, or is it just you?
AMY: Okay.
MRS ROSSITER: Is it about the bins?
DOCTOR: Pardon?
RORY: Community support. Just checking up on community-based things.
JULIE: Can I help you?
AMY: Hi. Er, yeah. No, sorry. I was just wondering if you've had any bother around here?
RORY: Is everything okay?
MRS ROSSITER: The bins. I can't be expected to get down all them stairs. I need new knees.
JULIE: Bother? What do you mean?
AMY: Well, I mean
RORY: Are your neighbours nice? Do you get on well?
JULIE: He didn't send you, did he?
AMY: Who?
PURCELL: Jim Purcell. Course we get on well. I'm their landlord. They love me, don't they?
RORY: You're the landlord?
DOCTOR: Not the bins, no, Miss?
MRS ROSSITER: Mrs Rossiter.
PURCELL: I thought you'd know that, being from community support.
RORY: Yeah. Yes. Yes, of course. Sorry.
MRS ROSSITER: I've already got a new hip. I'll be able to manage when I get the knees. Up and down them stairs like Sherpa Tensing, then.
DOCTOR: Can I come in?
RORY: Oh.
MRS ROSSITER: Course not. You could be anyone.
DOCTOR: I could be, but I'm not.
RORY: Or maybe it's best if I come back another time.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
AMY: We've got to find that kid.
RORY: Maybe we should let the monsters gobble him up.
AMY: Hey. Any luck?
DOCTOR: Three old ladies, a traffic warden from Croatia and a man with ten cats.
RORY: What are we actually looking for?
DOCTOR: Ten cats. Scared kid, remember?
AMY: I found scary kids. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Er, try the next floor down. Catch you later.
AMY: Okay.
RORY: Maybe it was, you know, junk mail.
AMY: What?
RORY: The message on the psychic paper. Maybe it was just nothing.
ALEX: Oh. Right. That was quick.
DOCTOR: Was it?
ALEX: Claire said she'd phone someone. Social Services.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes.
ALEX: It's not easy, you know, admitting your kid's got a problem.
DOCTOR: You've got a problem. I've got a problem. I bet they're connected, I'm the Doctor. Call me Doctor. What can I call you?
ALEX: Alex.
DOCTOR: Hello, Alex.
DOCTOR: So, tell me about George.
MRS ROSSITER: What a blooming mess. I'm the only one who gives a monkeys round here any more. Shocking. Talking to yourself now, Elsie. They say it's the first sign.
MRS ROSSITER: Oh, Lord. Come out of there! Don't be so ruddy horrible, trying to scare an old lady to death. It's not right. Is that you, George? I'll tell your mum and dad. Come on, you little devil. Let's see your face.
ALEX: Ever since he was born he's been a funny kid.
DOCTOR: Funny's good. We like funny, don't we?
ALEX: He never cries. Bottles it all up, I suppose. Tell him off, he just looks at you.
DOCTOR: How old is he?
ALEX: He was eight in January. I mean, he should be growing out of stuff like this, shouldn't he?
DOCTOR: Maybe. It's got worse, though lately?
ALEX: Yeah. We talked about getting help. You know, maybe sending him somewhere. He started getting these nervous tics. You know, funny little cough, blinking all the time. But now it's got completely out of hand. I mean, he's scared to death of everything.
DOCTOR: Pantaphobia.
ALEX: What?
DOCTOR: That's what it's called. Pantaphobia. Not a fear of pants though, if that's what you're thinking. It's a fear of everything. Including pants, I suppose, in that case. Sorry. Go on.
ALEX: He hates clowns.
DOCTOR: Understandable.
ALEX: Old toys. He thinks the old lady across the way is a witch. He hates having a bath in case there's something under the water. The lift sounds like someone breathing. Look, I don't know. I'm not an expert. Maybe you can get through to him.
DOCTOR: I'll do my best.
RORY: Amy? Amy? Are you here?
AMY: Yeah. Here. No, here. It's me.
RORY: You okay?
AMY: Yeah, I think so.
RORY: What happened to the lift? We were in a lift, weren't we?
AMY: Yeah, yeah. We. I remember getting in and then. What?
RORY: We're dead, aren't we.
AMY: Eh?
RORY: The lift fell and we're dead.
AMY: Shut up.
RORY: We're dead. Again.
AMY: Oh, shut up. Let's just find out where we are.
RORY: You know, it's obvious what's happened.
AMY: Yeah? Really? Because it's not obvious to me.
RORY: The Tardis has gone funny again. Some time slippy thing. You know, The Doctor's back there in Eastenders-land and we're stuck here in the past. This is probably seventeen hundred and something.
AMY: Yay. My favourite year.
ALEX: George? You okay? What's the matter? Oh. Never mind. Were you having a nightmare, son?
GEORGE: Wasn't a nightmare. I wasn't asleep. Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
GEORGE: A doctor? Have you come to take me away?
DOCTOR: No, George. I just want to talk to you.
GEORGE: What about?
DOCTOR: About the monsters.
AMY: A bit neglected, wherever it is.
RORY: Let's find the front door, at least. Then we can work out where we are. When we are.
AMY: Rory?
RORY: Hmm?
AMY: Look at this.
RORY: Well, it's a copper pan.
AMY: No, it's not. It's wood. It's made of wood and just painted to look like copper.
RORY: That is stupid.
AMY: Wait. Hang on.
AMY: There's a switch.
RORY: Wow. Well, not seventeen hundred and something, then.
AMY: It's glass. It's a glass eye.
AMY: Stop doing that.
RORY: It's not me. Come on.
AMY: Yeah. Hang on.
ALEX: Maybe it was things on the telly, you know?
DOCTOR: Right.
ALEX: Scary stuff, getting under his skin, frightening him.
DOCTOR: Mmm-hmm.
ALEX: We stopped letting him watch.
DOCTOR: Oh, you don't want to do that.
ALEX: Then Claire thought it might have been something he was reading.
DOCTOR: Great. Reading's great. You like stories, George? Yeah? Me, too. When I was your age, about, ooo, a thousand years ago, I loved a good bedtime story. The Three Little Sontarans. The Emperor Dalek's New Clothes. Snow White And The Seven Keys To Doomsday, eh? All the classics.
DOCTOR: Rubbish. Must be broken. I hate those things. Better tidy it away, though, eh? How about in here? No. Not in the cupboard. Why not in there, George?
ALEX: It's a thing. A thing we got him doing ages back. Anything that frightens him, we put it in the cupboard. Creepy toys, scary pictures, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: And is that where the monsters go? Yeah. There's nothing to be scared of, George. It's just a cupboard.
ALEX: Front door.
RORY: Let's try down here.
PURCELL: Evening.
ALEX: Oh, hi.
PURCELL : How's Claire?
ALEX : Good, thanks. At work. Look, er, this really isn't a good time. Maybe later I
PURCELL : And the kiddie?
ALEX : Good. Yeah.
PURCELL : You know how I hate to mention it, but it's that time again.
ALEX : Yes.
PURCELL : And you know I like my money prompt.
ALEX : The thing is, I still haven't found anywhere since the shop shut, and Claire's wage only goes so far. I thought we could, you know, come to some sort of arrangement.
GEORGE: Is that a torch?
DOCTOR: Screwdriver.
PURCELL : No can do, son. If I went around
DOCTOR: A sonic one. And other stuff.
GEORGE: Please may I see the other stuff?
DOCTOR: You may.
DOCTOR: Ah, pretty cool, eh?
PURCELL: Listen to him. Isn't he awful, eh? Don't growl at the nice man, Bernard. He don't mean to upset daddy, do you?
ALEX: No.
PURCELL: Look, son, I know what you're thinking. Here comes horrible Purcell after his rent. Dog on a chain. See? Wasn't expecting that, was you? I'm not as daft as I look. In fact, I'm not daft at all.
DOCTOR: That's better. No tears from George, that's what I've heard. Go on, give us a smile, there's a brave little soldier. Bit rusty at this. Anyway, let's open this cupboard, eh? There's nothing to be
DOCTOR:  Off the scale. Off the scale. Off the scale. How?
PURCELL : All I want is my three hundred and fifty pound. Simple as that. Night, night. Come on, son. Come on.
ALEX: Right. Sorry about that. So, have we got this thing open yet?
DOCTOR: No! No, no, no, no, no. You don't want to do that.
ALEX: Why?
DOCTOR: Because George's monsters are real.
RORY: Oh, at last. Argh.
AMY: What is it?
RORY: No doorknob. Wooden pans, a massive glass eye, and now no doorknob.
AMY: And this clock.
RORY: What?
AMY: Look, the hands, they're painted on.
ALEX: You're supposed to be a professional. I'll never get him to sleep now. It's so irresponsible.
DOCTOR: No, Alex. Responsible. Very. Cupboard bad. Cupboard not bare. Stay away from cupboard. And there's something else. Something I've missed. Something staring me in the face.
ALEX: Look, I'd like you to leave, please. You're just making things worse. Will you stop making tea. I want you to leave.
DOCTOR: No.
ALEX: What? What do you mean no? Leave. Get out. Now, please. Look, maybe this was a bad idea. We should sort out George ourselves.
DOCTOR: You can't.
ALEX: No one's going to tell us how to run our lives. I don't care who you are or what wheels have been set in motion. We'll sort it.
DOCTOR: I'm not just a professional. I'm the Doctor.
ALEX: What's that supposed to mean?
DOCTOR: It means I've come a long way to get here, Alex. A very long way. George sent a message. A distress call, if you like. Whatever's inside that cupboard is so terrible, so powerful, that it amplified the fears of an ordinary little boy across all the barriers of time and space.
ALEX: Eh?
DOCTOR: Through crimson stars and silent stars and tumbling nebulas like oceans set on fire. Through empires of glass and civilizations of pure thought, and a whole, terrible, wonderful universe of impossibilities. You see these eyes? They're old eyes. And one thing I can tell you, Alex. Monsters are real.
ALEX: You're not from Social Services, are you?
DOCTOR: First things first. You got any Jammie Dodgers?
MRS ROSSITER: Please, I don't like being on me own. If there's anyone here, please help me.
AMY: You hear that?
RORY: Yeah. Wait.
AMY: They're getting closer.
RORY: They?
AMY: Oh, it's just a. It's a dummy. Oh, it's just a dummy.
RORY: This is weird.
AMY: Yeah, says the time travelling nurse. Yeah, er, let's just leave that for now. Come on.
DOCTOR: What is it with these photos? Anyway. Good. Nice tea. Nothing like a cuppa, but, decision. Should we open the cupboard?
ALEX: What?
DOCTOR: Should we?
ALEX: Well
DOCTOR: Got to open the cupboard, haven't we. Course we have. Come on, Alex. Alex, come on. How else will we ever find out what's going on here?
ALEX: All right, but you said
DOCTOR: Monsters. Yeah, well, that's what I do. Breakfast, dinner and tea. Fight the monsters. So this, this is just an average day at the office for me.
ALEX: Okay, yeah. You're right.
DOCTOR: Or maybe we shouldn't open the cupboard.
ALEX: Eh?
DOCTOR: We have no idea what might be in there. How powerful, how evil that thing might be.
ALEX: We don't?
DOCTOR: Come on, Alex. Alex, come on. Are you crazy? We can't open the cupboard.
ALEX: God, no, no, we mustn't.
DOCTOR: Right. That settles it.
ALEX: Yes. Settles what?
DOCTOR: Going to open the cupboard.
PURCELL; There's nothing on. Never anything on, is there, Bernard? Bergerac, God help us. Thirty years old, that. Where's the boxing? Meant to be boxing on. Looks like we are going to have to watch that film again.
PURCELL: What the? Hold on a minute. This is not, no.
PURCELL: Help me, Bernard. Help.
DOCTOR: I don't understand it. It has to be the cupboard. The readings from the sonic screwdriver, they were
DOCTOR: How old is George, Alex?
ALEX: What? How old?
DOCTOR: Yes. How old is George?
ALEX: Well, I told you. Just turned eight.
DOCTOR: So you remember when he was born, then?
ALEX: Of course.
DOCTOR: Course you do. How could you not? You and Claire. Christmas Eve, 2002, right?
ALEX: What? Er yeah.
DOCTOR: Couple of weeks before George was born. Tell me about the day he arrived. Must have been wonderful.
ALEX: Well, it was the best day of my  life.
DOCTOR: Sure?
ALEX: Yes.
DOCTOR: You don't sound sure.
ALEX: What are you trying to say? Look, I don't like this. I've told you before, I want you to go.
DOCTOR: What's the matter, Alex?
ALEX: I can't. Oh, don't. Oh, this is scary.
DOCTOR: No, Alex, this is scary. Claire with baby George. Newborn, yes?
ALEX: Yes.
DOCTOR: Less than a month after Christmas.
ALEX: So?
DOCTOR: So look. Look. Claire's not pregnant.
ALEX: What?
DOCTOR: Not pregnant.
ALEX: Well, of course not. Claire can't have kids!
DOCTOR: Say that again.
ALEX: We tried everything. She was desperate. As much IVF as we could afford, but. Claire can't have kids. How? How can I have forgotten that?
DOCTOR: Who are you, George?
ALEX: It's not possible. This isn't
DOCTOR: George?
DOCTOR: George! George, what's going on? Are you doing it?
ALEX: What's happening?
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters.
DOCTOR: George, no!
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters.
ALEX: Help me, Doctor!
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters.
DOCTOR: George, no!
GEORGE: Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters. Please save me from the monsters.
ALEX: No!
RORY: Why aren't there any lights? I miss lights. You don't really miss things till they're gone, do you? It's like what my nan used to say. You'll never miss the water till the well runs dry.
AMY: Rory.
RORY: Except light, I mean, not water. Lights are great, aren't they? I mean if this place was all lit up, we wouldn't even be worried at all.
AMY: Rory. Panicking, a bit.
RORY: Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
AMY: Yeah.
PURCELL: Help me, please. Keep them away from me. Keep them away.
AMY: I take it all back. Panic now.
DOLL: Don't run away. We want to play.
AMY: Lock it!
RORY: There isn't a lock.
RORY: No, no, no, no, no!
AMY: Come on!
DOCTOR: So, Claire can't have kids and something responded to that. Responded to that need. What could do that?
ALEX: I thought you were the expert, fighting monsters all day long. You tell me.
DOCTOR: Oi! Listen, mush. Old eyes, remember? I've been around the block a few times. More than a few. They've knocked down the blocks I've been round and re-built them as bigger blocks. Super blocks. And I've been round them as well. I can't remember everything.
ALEX: Doctor
DOCTOR: It's like trying to remember the name of someone you met at a party when you were two.
ALEX: Doctor, the lift.
DOCTOR: And I can't just plump for Brian like I normally do.
ALEX: Doctor, listen!
DOCTOR: Shush. What's that?
ALEX: It's the lift. It's the sound that the lift makes. George is scared stiff of it.
AMY: We can't stay in here. We've got to get out!
RORY: Er, how?
AMY: Take control, Rory. Take control of the only thing we can. Letting them in.
RORY: Letting them in?
AMY: It'll surprise them. We open the door and we push past them. Kick them, punch them, anything, okay?
DOLL : Time to play.
RORY: Okay.
AMY: Okay.
AMY: Go on!
RORY: Amy, come on.
AMY: Rory!
RORY: Amy! Get off
CHILDREN:  Tick tock goes the clock, and all the years they fly. Tick tock and all too soon, you and I must die.
ALEX: Five times.
DOCTOR: What?
ALEX: The lights. It's happening five times. It's like one of George's habits. We have to switch the lights on and off five times.
DOCTOR: Now you're getting it.
ALEX: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: What do you tell George to do, Alex, with everything that scares him?
ALEX: Well, put it in the cupboard.
DOCTOR: Exactly. And George isn't just an ordinary little boy, we know that now, so anything scary he puts in here. Scary toys, like the dolls' house. Scary noises, like, like the lift. Even his little rituals have become part of it. A psychic repository for all his fears, but what is he?
ALEX: Oh, my God.
ALEX: A gun? You've got a gun?
DOCTOR: It's not a gun. Wood! I've got to invent a setting for wood. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Come on.
AMY DOLL: Don't run away. We just want to play.
DOCTOR: Massive psychic field, perfect perception filter, and that need. That need of Claire's to, to. Stupid Doctor. Ow.
DOCTOR: George is a Tenza. Of course he is.
ALEX: He's a what?
DOCTOR: A cuckoo. A cuckoo in the nest. A Tenza. He's a Tenza. Millions of them hatch in space and then whoomph, off they drift, looking for a nest. The Tenza young can sense exactly what their foster parents want and then they assimilate perfectly.
ALEX: George is an alien?
DOCTOR: Yep.
ALEX: But he's he's our child.
DOCTOR: Of course he is. The child you always wanted. He sensed that instinctively and sought you out, but something scared him. Started this cycle of fear. It's all completely instinctive, subconscious. George isn't even aware that he's controlling it. So we have to make him aware. George!
DOCTOR : George, you're the only one who can stop this
DOCTOR: But you have to believe. You have to believe. You have to know you're safe.
DOCTOR : I can't save you from the monsters.
DOCTOR: Only you can. George, listen to me.
DOCTOR : George, listen to me.
DOCTOR: Rory!
RORY: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Where's Amy?
DOCTOR: Oh, no. George! George, you have to face your fears!
DOCTOR : You have to face them now.
DOCTOR: You have to open the cupboard, or we'll all be trapped here forever in a living death. George!
DOCTOR : George, listen to me. George! George, listen to me. George!
DOCTOR: Please! George, you have to end this. End this. End it. End it now!
DOCTOR: George. George, you did it. You did it. Hey, it's okay. It's all okay now. Everything's going to be fine.
DOCTOR: No! No! No, no, no, no, no. George, you created this whole world. This whole thing. You can smash it. You can destroy it.
DOCTOR: Something's holding him back. Something's holding him back. Something.
GEORGE : Who are you?
DOCTOR : I'm the Doctor.
GEORGE : A doctor? Have you come to take me away? Away. Away. Away.
DOCTOR: That's what did it. That's what the trigger was. He thought you were rejecting him. He thought he wasn't wanted, that someone was going to come and take him away.
ALEX: Well, we, we talked about it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, and he heard you, Alex. A Tenza's sole function is to fit in, to be wanted, and you were rejecting him.
ALEX: We just couldn't cope! We needed help!
DOCTOR: Yes, but George didn't know that. He thought you were rejecting him. He still thinks it.
ALEX: But how can we keep him? How can we? He's not
DOCTOR: Not what?
ALEX: He's not human.
DOCTOR: No.
GEORGE: Dad!
ALEX: Whatever you are, whatever you do, you're my son, and I will never, ever send you away. Oh, George. Oh, my little boy.
GEORGE: Dad.
ALEX: My little boy.
GEORGE: Dad.
ROSSITER: Oh dear. Must be them tablets. Oh. Oh, dear.
AMY: Was I?
RORY: Yeah.
ALEX : Right, stay still. Still as a statue, or I'll come and get you.
ALEX : I'm coming, I'm coming.
CLAIRE: Hi.
ALEX : Hey, close eyes.
DOCTOR: Hello. You're Claire, I expect. Claire,  how'd you feel about kippers?
CLAIR: Er who
ALEX: They sent someone about George. It's all sorted.
DOCTOR: Yeah, we had a great time, didn't we?
GEORGE: Yeah.
DOCTOR: See? He's fine.
CLAIRE: What, just like that?
DOCTOR: Yes. Trust me.
ALEX: Doctor, wait.
DOCTOR: Sorry, yes. Bye.
ALEX: No, no, you can't just. I mean
DOCTOR: It's sorted. You sorted it. Good man, Alex. Proud of you.
ALEX: What, that's it?
DOCTOR: Well, apart from making sure he eats his greens and getting him into a good school, yes.
ALEX: But is he going to, I don't know, sprout another head or three eyes or something?
DOCTOR: He's one of the Tenza, remember. He'll adapt perfectly now. Hey! Be whatever you want him to be. I might pop back around puberty, mind you. Always a funny time.
CLAIRE : Kippers are getting cold.
DOCTOR: Come on, you two. Things to do, people to see, whole civilisations to save. You feeling okay?
AMY: Er, I think so.
DOCTOR: Well, it's good to be all back together again, in the flesh. Come on.
DOCTOR: Now, did someone mention something about planets and history and stuff?
RORY: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Where do you want to go?
AMY: Er
DOCTOR: Mind's gone blank.
AMY: Well, I have just been turned into a wooden dolly.
DOCTOR: Excuses, excuses.
RORY: It's tough, though. It's like being given three wishes. The whole universe?
DOCTOR: Or universes. Ooo, three wishes, like Ali Baba. How about that?
CHILDREN:  Tick tock goes the clock, even for the Doctor.
