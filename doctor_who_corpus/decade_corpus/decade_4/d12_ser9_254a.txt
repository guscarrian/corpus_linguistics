The Magician's Apprentice
OHILA: He has asked to see you. His servants seek you everywhere. Will you go?
DOCTOR: No.
OHILA: Why do you always lie?
DOCTOR: Why do you always assume I'm lying?
OHILA: It saves time. The truth - will you go?
DOCTOR: No.
OHILA: When?
DOCTOR: Soon.
OHILA: Why? Did something happen?
DOCTOR: No.
OHILA: Was it recent?
DOCTOR: Yes.
OHILA: Whatever it was, you owe that creature nothing.
DOCTOR: He and I've known each other a long time.
OHILA: You've been enemies for all of it.
DOCTOR: An enemy's just a friend you don't really know yet. Sorry. What, was that me being cynical again?
OHILA: Aren't we friends, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's different. I don't like you!
OHILA:  Which means you can trust me.
DOCTOR: You know who to give that to?
DOCTOR: I won't go straight away. I'll hang out for a bit. Probably meditate on a rock somewhere. Get myself ready.
OHILA: You are embarking on an enterprise that will end in your destruction.
DOCTOR: You could say that about being born.
OHILA: Wherever you go, there are people who care enough to find you.
DOCTOR: Look after the universe for me. I've put a lot of work into it.
OHILA: Anyone can hide from an enemy, Doctor. No one from a friend.
The Doctor's Meditation by Stephen Moffatt - released in cinemas outside the UK on 15 Sept 2015
The Meditation Begins
DOCTOR: How many days have I been here?
BORS: About three hours.
DOCTOR: Three hours?
BORS: Well, nearly.
DOCTOR: Maybe Clara's right. She keeps telling me I've got Attention Deficit er something or other.
BORS: What is your journey?
DOCTOR: You can't come with me, Bors.
BORS: I'm pledged to your service ever since you saved my life.
DOCTOR: I didn't save your life. You had a splinter.
BORS: Where is it you go, and why must you meditate first?
DOCTOR: Someone I know is very sick. He'll want to see me before  while there's still time.
BORS: An old friend?
DOCTOR: Someone I've known a very long time.
BORS: If there is danger, let me ride at your side.
DOCTOR: You can't help me, not where I'm going. I have to get myself ready. I have to be alone. I have to think. No more distractions.
BORS: As you wish, Sir Doctor.
DOCTOR: Urgh. Hang on a minute.  The water.
BORS: The water, sir?
DOCTOR: I don't like it. I can't meditate properly without decent water.
DOCTOR: We're going to dig a well! Right on, er, this spot. There will be excellent water here.
BORS: How'd you know?
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm very good at water.
DOCTOR: This is definitely a good spot for water.
BORS: But this is the twelfth place you've made us dig.
DOCTOR: Well, twelve is my lucky number.
DOCTOR: Here. No, here. Look at this grass. This is watery grass. Follow the squelchy.
BORS: Well, you've all the water you need now and it is the finest in the land. Your meditation can begin.
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose it can. Except.
BORS: Except?
DOCTOR: Do you know what this well really needs?
BORS: Nothing. It's perfect.
DOCTOR: A visitor's centre.
BORS: Everyone has agreed on the plan for the throne room extension, but we're we're not quite sure what you mean by a sun roof.
DOCTOR: Look at this coin. You see it?
BORS:  I see it.
DOCTOR: Where is it now?
BORS: There. 
DOCTOR: No, it isn't.
BORS: Yes, it is. I saw it.
DOCTOR: Are you sure? I'm really a very good magician.
BORS: What is it you dread?
DOCTOR: Why would I dread anything?
BORS: You're always making jokes. You never sit still, like you're running in fear of days to come.
DOCTOR: I thought you were an idiot.
BORS: I know. I thought that too.
DOCTOR: Good. I was worried I would have to break it to you
BORS: Are you sure?
DOCTOR: I've been avoiding it. One last night, then I have to go.
BORS: Do you wish to be alone?
DOCTOR: I have to prepare myself.
BORS: But why? You've never explained.
DOCTOR: I did something wrong. I let somebody down when I should have been brave enough and strong enough to do better. Tomorrow I pay the price. Tonight, I make myself ready.
BORS: Goodbye, Magician. You have widened my mind.
DOCTOR: You do realise you're still an idiot.
BORS: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good. I have to be quiet now. Quiet as the grave.
BORS: I do not believe you are capable of silence.
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, well, we'll see about that, shall we?
BORS: We shall, Sir Doctor.
DOCTOR: No more distractions. Got to focus. No more distractions. Bors!
DOCTOR: Are you any good with a broadsword?
BORS: Yes.
DOCTOR: Fancy a friendly?
BORS: Enough, Magician! I do not believe that you will meditate. It is not in your nature. If this is to be your last night here then we shall celebrate. There shall be revels. But first past, tell me your story. Tell me how you came to this place and why now you are compelled to leave it. I will not depart this room until you do so.
DOCTOR:  I suppose I do owe you.
BORS: I have served you loyally, Sir Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you have.
BORS: Then begin your tale.
DOCTOR: Well, a little while ago, a very long way from here, I was looking for a bookshop. Instead, I found a battlefield. Story of my life. I've seen many battlefields. But this one will be different. This one will be my last.
The Magician's Apprentice - the actual episode broadcast 19th Sept 2015
SOLDIER: Spread out! Get down!
SOLDIER: What's wrong?
KANZO: Was that a child?
KANZO: Hey! You there, stop! Stop running!
KANZO: It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. Just don't run.
SOLDIER: Kanzo?
KANZO: I'll catch up.
SOLDIER: There are clam drones two miles away.
KANZO: I know. I'll be fine. Just go.
KANZO: What are you doing out here, huh? Did you get lost?
KANZO: Stay still. Stay absolutely still.
KANZO: I'm just scanning the ground. I think we've got company. Do you know what hand mines are?
KANZO: Well, in that case you know you've got to stand absolutely still. Right?
KANZO: Have you ever seen a hand mine?  Where?
KANZO: Okay. It's okay. Everything's going to be fine
BOY: Help me! Someone, please! Help me! Help me!
DOCTOR : Your chances of survival are about one in a thousand. So here's what you do. You forget the thousand, and you concentrate on the one. Pick it up. I said, pick it up!
DOCTOR : I'm straight ahead of you, about fifty feet. Can you see me?
DOCTOR: The device in your hand is creating an acoustic corridor, so that we can talk. Do you understand?
BOY: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm just a passer-by. I was looking for a bookshop. How do you think I'm doing?
BOY: This isn't a bookshop.
DOCTOR: No, this is a war. A very old one, going by the mix of technology. Which war is this? I get them all muddled up.
BOY: It's just the war.
DOCTOR: Where am I? What planet is this?
BOY: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Well, neither do I. I try never to understand. It's called an open mind. Now, you have got to make a choice.
BOY: A choice?
DOCTOR: Yes, you have got to decide that you're going to live. Survival is just a choice. Choose it now.
BOY: If I move, they'll get me.
DOCTOR: I told you, you have one chance in a thousand. But one is all you ever need. What's your name? Come on, faith in the future. Introduce yourself! Tell me the name of the boy who isn't going to die today.
BOY: Davros. My name is Davros. Hello? Are you still there? Please, you've got to help me. You said I could survive. You said you'd help me. Help me!
SINGER: Father, why are all the women weeping?
COLONY SARFF: We are Colony Sarff. We bring harm.
COLONY SARFF: Where is the Doctor?  Where is the Doctor?
COLONY SARFF: Where is the Doctor!
SHADOW ARCHITECT: Deploy the under-regiment across both sectors. That number of suicide moons cannot be ignored.
SHADOW ARCHITECT: Apparently we have a security breach. I won't ask how you got in here, but I will demand to know your business, Colony Sarff.
COLONY SARFF: Where is the Doctor?
SHADOW ARCHITECT: I've no idea. He's not our concern, and he's certainly not your employer's.
COLONY SARFF: The Doctor is required.
SHADOW ARCHITECT: For what? Colony Sarff, you need to tell me. What does Davros want with the Doctor?
OHILA: Welcome, Colony Sarff. We are the Sisterhood of Karn. If you do not leave our world immediately, we will take your skin.
COLONY SARFF: Where is the Doctor?
OHILA: Where he always is. Right behind you, and one step ahead. Tread carefully when you seek the Doctor, Colony Sarff, or he will be the last thing you find.
COLONY: Davros, creator of the Daleks, dark Lord of Skaro.
OHILA: What of him?
COLONY SARFF: Davros is dying.
OHILA: Davros is ancient. He should have been dust centuries ago.
COLONY SARFF: He has a message for the Doctor.
OHILA: Then you will give it to me.
OHILA: Your powers mean nothing here. Give me the message and leave.
COLONY SARFF: Tell the Doctor, Davros knows. Davros remembers. Tell him he must face Davros one last time.
COLONY SARFF:  Davros knows. Davros remembers.
OHILA: Doctor? What have you done?
DAVROS: Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.
COLONY SARFF: You are dreaming, Lord Davros.
DAVROS: No. I am anticipating.
COLONY SARFF: He cannot be found.
DAVROS: Of course he can. He has a weakness. If you seek the Doctor, first seek his friends.
RYAN: Will I get it back after school?
CHILDREN: Urgh!
CLARA: How will you know which one's yours?
CLARA: Fine, then. Right. Now, where was I? Jane Austen. Amazing writer, brilliant comic observer, and strictly among ourselves, a phenomenal kisser.
ALISON: Miss? Miss?
RYAN: Miss?
ALISON: Is she okay?
CLARA: Everybody turn on their phones. News websites and Twitter.
RYAN: Twitter?
CLARA: Hashtag, #ThePlanesHaveStopped
BBC NEWSREADER: Reports are coming in of planes hanging apparently motionless in the sky.
TV NEWSREADER: Footage of passenger jets, which have seemingly come to a complete standstill in mid-air.
MR DUNLOP: Miss Oswald, a call at the office.
CLARA: Yeah, that would probably be UNIT.
MR DUNLOP: They're telling me you're needed. They were going to put me through to the Prime Minister.
CLARA: Mister Dunlop, sorry. I have to take the rest of the day off owing to a, er, personal crisis.
CLARA: Yes. Yes, yes, yes, I'm coming. No, don't send a helicopter. Think it through.
NEWSREADER : Attempts at communications with the planes, with pilots, crew, passengers, all have failed.
NEWSREADER : Family members with candlelight vigils around the world. Meanwhile, reports are coming in from Caracas, Tel Aviv, Beijing. It seems no corner of the planet is unaffected.
KATE: The planes aren't responding. No, none of them. It's radio silence. I've got to go. Tell the President I'll call him back.
KATE: He's not answering his phone. Have you tried?
CLARA: We don't know enough yet. He doesn't appreciate gossip.
KATE: Gossip?
CLARA: How many planes?
JAC: 4,165 aircraft currently airborne.
KATE: That's a lot of passengers.
CLARA: That's a lot of fuel.
KATE: Oh, dear God. Yes, it is.
CLARA: Okay, so, what could you do with 4,000 flying bombs?
JAC: Ah, well, 439 nuclear power stations currently active.
KATE: What else?
CLARA: I dunno. Er, fault lines. Earthquake, a tsunami?
JAC: Running simulations now.
KATE: So this is an attack?
CLARA: What kind of an attack advertises? Why show somebody what you can do? Why not just do it? What's actually happened to the planes? What are the pilots saying?
KATE: We, we can't contact them.
JAC: The planes haven't stopped. They're actually frozen. Like, frozen in time. Pardon my sci-fi, but this is beyond any human technology.
KATE: Okay, so we need the Doctor.
CLARA: Kate, we can't just phone the Doctor and bleat, he'll go Scottish. Come on. What have we got? What do we know? It's not an attack, it's not an invasion, because, well, that doesn't come with a fair warning. So, somebody needs our attention. Somebody who needs to put a gun to our heads to make us listen. Oh.
KATE: Oh?
MIKE: We've got a message. The Doctor channel.
CLARA: Sorry, what?
KATE: He never uses it. I doubt he remembers it even exists.
CLARA: Then who is it?
MIKE: Decrypting. We're getting text through, I think.
CLARA: Texting? Definitely not the Doctor.
TEXT: You so fine.
KATE: Have you got any more?
MIKE: Coming.
TEXT: You blow my mind. Hey Missy, you so fine, you so fine, you blow my mind! Hey Missy!!!
MISSY : Today, I shall be talking to you out of  the square window!
KATE: What the hell was that? How did she do that?
JAC: Dunno. Some sort of psychic projection, or something.
KATE: Oh great, thanks.
MISSY : Okay, cutting to the chase. Not dead, back, big surprise, never mind. I'm in a lovely little square in one of your, oh, I don't know, hot countries. There's a light breeze coming from the east, this coffee is a buzz-monster in my brain, and I'm going to need eight snipers.
KATE: Eight what?
MISSY : Three for each heart, and two for my brain stem. You'll have to switch me off fast, before I can regenerate. How fast can you get here? Ooo, I'll need to arrange you a flight corridor.
KATE: Why do you need snipers?
MISSY : Because it's the only way she'll feel safe enough to talk to me. Shall we say four o'clock?
MISSY: Oh, saucy.
MISSY: Go on, then.
MISSY: How's your boyfriend? Still tremendously dead, I expect.
CLARA: Still dead, yeah. How come you're still alive?
MISSY: Death is for other people, dear. Would you like to sit in the shade? I know how you humans burn.
MISSY: Better? I expect you've tried to contact him by now. Well, you should know, I can't find him either. No one can.
CLARA: That happens, now and then.
MISSY: Not like this.
MISSY: It's a confession dial.
CLARA: A what?
MISSY: In your terms, a will. The Last Will and Testament of the Time Lord known as the Doctor, to be delivered, according to ancient tradition, to his closest friend, on the eve of his final day.
MISSY: Ah, ah! What are you doing?
CLARA: You said. I thought.
MISSY: No, no, no, no, no. It was delivered to me.
CLARA: You?
MISSY: Well of course it was sent to me. What have you got to do with it? I'm his friend. You're just
CLARA: I'm just what?
MISSY: See that couple over there?
MISSY: You're the puppy.
CLARA: Since when do you care about the Doctor?
MISSY: Since always. Since the Cloister Wars. Since the night he stole the moon and the President's wife. Since he was a little girl. One of those was a lie. Can you guess which one?
CLARA: He's not your friend. You keep trying to kill him.
MISSY: He keeps trying to kill me. It's sort of our texting. We've been at it for ages.
CLARA: Mmm. Must be love.
MISSY: Oh, don't be disgusting. We're Time Lords, not animals. Try, nano-brain, to rise above the reproductive frenzy of your noisy little food chain, and contemplate friendship. A friendship older than your civilisation, and infinitely more complex.
CLARA: So the Doctor is your bezzy mate and I'm supposed to believe that you've turned good?
MISSY: Good?
SOLDIER : Man down!
CLARA:  No!
SOLDIER : Man down!
KATE: Don't shoot her. Do not shoot her!
MISSY: By the ring on his finger, he was married, and I, I think I detected some baby leakage on his jacket, so he had a family. No, I've not turned good.
KATE: Nobody fire!
MISSY: Ooh, wow, I'm on a roll. Thanks for bringing spares.
CLARA: Stop it. Just stop it. Don't shoot anybody else!
MISSY: Oi, you, sweaty one, on your knees. Let's have a goodbye selfie for your kids.
CLARA: Missy, nobody else!
MISSY: Say something nice.
CLARA: No.
MISSY: I'll kill everyone in this square.
CLARA: Start with me. Then what, hey? You came here for my help.
MISSY: Because the Doctor is in danger.
CLARA: Make me believe you.
MISSY: How?
CLARA: Release the planes.
MISSY: The planes are keeping me alive. I mean, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight naughty little snipers ready to kill me.
CLARA: Yeah. On my command.
CLARA: Your best friend is in danger. Show me you care. Make me believe.
JAC: The planes! The planes are all moving again.
MISSY: It's only a basic Time Stop. Parlour trick. Couldn't have done anything with them anyway.
CLARA: What does it say?
MISSY: What does what say?
CLARA: His confession.
MISSY: It will only open when he's dead.
CLARA: Then it won't open, will it?
MISSY: Question. If the Doctor has one last night to live, if he's certain he's facing the end of his life, where, in all of space and time, would he go?
CLARA: Here.
MISSY: Well, yes, Earth, obviously! But where? When?
JAC: The algorithm generates probabilities based on crisis points, anomalies, anachronisms, keywords.
KATE: Such as?
JAC: Blue box, Doctor.
JAC: There we go. San Martino, Troy, multiples for New York,
JAC  And three possible versions of Atlantis. It's easier than you'd think. The Doctor makes a lot of noise and he loves to make an entrance.
KATE: But which one is the one? Where is he now?
CLARA: How's a Time Lord supposed to die?
MISSY: Meditation. Repentance and acceptance.
MISSY : Contemplation of the absolute.
CLARA : Great, thanks. Change the algorithm. Eliminate the crisis points. Where is the Doctor making the most noise, but there isn't any crisis?
CLARA:  We're looking for a party.
CLARA: There he is. "Do not go gentle into that good night."
MISSY: You go, girl!
MISSY: Whoo, whoo whoo! Mummy, do it again! Vortex manipulators. Yours is slaved to mine. Cheap and nasty time travel.
BORS: Face me, Magician! Face me!
MISSY: You probably want to throw up, don't you? Pick a local. According to you, this is where the Doctor is.
CLARA: Okay, how do we find him? How do we know what we're looking for?
MISSY: Anachronisms. The slightest, tiniest
MISSY: Anachronisms.
BORS: Dude! What is that?
DOCTOR: You said you wanted an axe fight.
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. In a few hundred years, that'll be really funny. It's a slow burner.
BORS: A musical instrument is not an axe.
DOCTOR: Yes, and a daffodil is not a broadsword, but I still won the last round!
DOCTOR: What do you think of my tank? Don't worry, it isn't loaded.
BORS: I don't like it.
DOCTOR: No, neither do I. I bought it for my fish.
BORS: Your fish?
DOCTOR: I may have ordered online!
DOCTOR: Oh, come on. Fish? Tank? Honestly, this stuff will be hilarious in a very few hundred years. Do please stick around.
CLARA: What's the matter with him? He's never like this.
MISSY: Oh, you really are new, aren't you?
CLARA: Wait, hang on. Did he just hear that? He doesn't know we're here, does he?
DOCTOR: Now, you lot. I have been here all day, and it's been a great day!
BORS: You've been here for three weeks.
DOCTOR: Three weeks? It must be nearly bedtime. Well, we've partied.
DOCTOR: Yes! I helped you dig a well, with a first-class, child-friendly visitor's centre! I've given you some top-notch maths tuition in a fun but relevant way. And I have also introduced the word "dude" several centuries early. Let me hear you!
ALL: Dude!
DOCTOR: Are you a Renaissance?
ALL: Dude!
DOCTOR: Are you a Medieval?
ALL: Dude!
DOCTOR: I am a dragon-slaying?
ALL: Dude!
DOCTOR: We are all the young?
ALL: Dudes!
DOCTOR: I like it. But I've got some sad news for you, dudes. Tonight, I'm going to have to leave you.
DOCTOR: But before I do, I'd like you to meet a couple of friends of mine.
CLARA: How did you know I was here? Did you see me?
DOCTOR: When do I not see you?
CLARA: What, one face in all of that crowd?
DOCTOR: There was a crowd, too?
CLARA: Wow, we're doing charm as well, now, are we? Which one of us is dying?
CLARA: Okay. And we're doing hugging now, too. I can't keep up.
DOCTOR: Well, you know what they say. Hugging is a great way to hide your face.
CLARA: Okay, look. I guessed a party, but not like this. What is this? This isn't you.
DOCTOR: I spent all day yesterday in a bow tie, the day before in a long scarf. It's my party, and all of me is invited.
MISSY: What the hell are you up to, man?
DOCTOR: It's the wicked stepmother! Everyone hiss!
MISSY: Apparently, you think you're going to die tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Well, I've got some good news about that.
MISSY: Oh, yeah?
DOCTOR: It's still today!
MISSY: Oh, that's very good.
DOCTOR: Bors. Is it a marble again? Did you swallow one of the marbles I gave you? Don't swallow marbles!
COLONY SARFF: Doctor. Your friends have led me to you. You will come.
DOCTOR: Says you and whose army?
DOCTOR: Nobody dies here. Not one person, not one of my friends, do you understand?
COLONY SARFF: Davros, creator of the Daleks, dark lord of Skaro, is dying.
DOCTOR: So I hear.
COLONY SARFF: He would speak with you again on the last night of his life.
DOCTOR: Then you will harm nobody in this place. Not one person. Are we very, very clear?
COLONY SARFF: Are you so dangerous, little man?
DOCTOR: You want to know how dangerous I am? Davros sent you. You know how stupid you are? Huh! You came!
DOCTOR: Is that supposed to frighten me? Snake nest in a dress? Now, explain, politely. Davros is my arch-enemy. Why would I want to talk to him?
MISSY: No, wait, hang on a minute. Davros is your arch-enemy now?
DOCTOR: Hush!
MISSY: I'll scratch his eye out.
COLONY SARFF: Davros knows. Davros remembers.
CLARA: That's yours.
DOCTOR: Er, it was.
CLARA: Was?
DOCTOR: I don't have a screwdriver any more.
MISSY: Ooo. Never seen that before. Doctor, the look on your face. What is that?
CLARA: Shame. You're ashamed. Doctor? What have you done?
YOUNG DAVROS : Please, you've got to help me. You said I could survive! You said you'd help me! Help me!
DOCTOR: Is your ship in orbit?
MISSY: It's a trap.
COLONY SARFF: Prepare yourself for teleport.
MISSY: Doctor, listen to me. I know traps, traps are my flirting. This is a trap.
DOCTOR: I am prepared.
MISSY: You sent me your confession dial. You threw yourself a three week party. You know what this is.
DOCTOR: Yes. Goodbye.  Goodbye, Clara.
CLARA: We're coming with him. Both of us, her and me.
DOCTOR: No! No, no, no. Under no circumstances! What are you doing now?
COLONY SARFF: Voting. We are a democracy. It is agreed.
DOCTOR: No, no, no! I forbid it, no! No! No! No! No!
BORS: Inform High Command. It is located. The Tardis is located.
DALEK : The Tardis will be procured.
DALEKS : Procure the Tardis. Procure the Tardis. Procure. Procure.
DOCTOR: Davros is the child of war, a war that wouldn't end. A thousand years of fighting, till nobody could remember why. So Davros, he created a new kind of warrior, one that wouldn't bother with that question. A mutant in a tank that would never, ever stop. And they never did.
CLARA: The Daleks?
DOCTOR: How scared must you be to seal every one of your own kind inside a tank?  Davros made the Daleks, but who made Davros?
MISSY: Okay, great. Coming out of hyperspace.
DOCTOR: So that's where he ended up.
CLARA: What is that?
DOCTOR: I don't know. A hospital?
CLARA: How long have we been waiting?   
DOCTOR: Who knows? It's always the way with hospitals.
COLONY SARFF: You will come. You will stay.
MISSY: Fair enough.
CLARA: Doctor. You sent Missy your confession dial.
DOCTOR: Well, we've known each other a long time. She's one of my own people.
CLARA: My point is, we both saw her die on Earth, ages ago. And obviously you knew that wasn't real. Or worse, hoped it wasn't. Either way, I think you've been lying.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
CLARA: Don't apologise. Make it up to me. There, see? Ha. Now you have to come back.
DOCTOR:  Gravity.
MISSY: I know.
CLARA: Gravity?
MISSY: Oh, yeah. You know what's wrong with the gravity in here?
CLARA: No.
MISSY: Nothing. It's perfect. But this is a space station, so the gravity should be artificial, all coppery-smelling round the edges, a tiny bit sexy.  But this feels real, man.  Like a planet.
CLARA: How can you and the Doctor be friends?
MISSY: Why shouldn't we be?
CLARA: You spend all your time fighting.
MISSY: Exactly.
MISSY: You know what this airlock is? I'll tell you. It's pants.
CLARA: What do you mean?
MISSY: I mean that today might be the day.
CLARA: What day?
MISSY: The day I kill you.
CLARA: What are you doing? Are you opening it?
MISSY: Yeah, course.
CLARA: Missy, we'll get sucked out!
MISSY: You and me together, off we go. Let's make jam!
DAVROS: Doctor?
DAVROS: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Davros.
DAVROS: I approve of your new face, Doctor. So much more like mine. Colony Sarff, untie our guest's hands.
DAVROS: You may leave us.
DAVROS: You came, then.
DOCTOR: Clearly.
DAVROS: Did you suspect a trap?
DOCTOR: I still do.
DAVROS: Then why are you here? Did you miss our conversations?
DOCTOR 4 : If you had created a virus in your laboratory
DOCTOR 5 : I'm not here as your prisoner, Davros...
DOCTOR 7 : Unimaginable power! Unlimited rice pudding!
DOCTOR 10 : Everything we saw. Everything we lost.
DOCTOR 6 : But did you bother to tell anyone they might be eating their own relatives?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, okay, you've made your point.
DAVROS: Have I?
DOCTOR 4 : If someone who knew the future pointed out a child to you, and told you that that child would grow up totally evil, to be a ruthless dictator who would destroy millions of lives, could you then kill that child?
DOCTOR: I get the point.
DAVROS: Do you know why you came, Doctor? You have a sense of duty. Of guilt, perhaps. And certainly of shame.
DOCTOR: You flatter me.
DAVROS: Pity. I intended to accuse. I believe that for the ultimate good of the universe, I was right to create the Daleks.
DOCTOR: You were very wrong.
DAVROS: This is the argument we've had since we met.
DOCTOR: It ended in the Time War.
DAVROS: It survived the Time War. But it will end tonight. That is why you are here.
DAVROS: It seems your friends have gone exploring.
MISSY: It's warm, isn't it?  For deep space, anyway.
CLARA: What are you doing?
MISSY: Treading softly.
CLARA: What, there's a floor?
MISSY: No. No, there's ground. This is the ground.
MISSY: We're on a planet. And that is not a space station. That is a building. And the rest of the planet, the whole thing, is invisible.
CLARA: That's ridiculous.
MISSY: Well, yes, of course it is. I mean, how would you ever find your glasses? Or the little girl's room? And what if you kissed an ugly? Unless, when you're part of the atmosphere, you start syncing with the spectrum.
CLARA: Why would anybody hide a whole planet?
MISSY: That would rather depend on the planet, dear.
MISSY: No.
DOCTOR: No!
MISSY: They've built it again. They've brought it back. No, no. No!
CLARA: What? What is it? Where are we?
DOCTOR: Skaro! You've brought me to Skaro.
DAVROS: Where does an old man go to die, but with his children?
CLARA: What's Skaro?
MISSY: The beginning. Where it all started. This is the planet of the Daleks!
DALEK: Correct.
DOCTOR:  Clara!
DAVROS: You cannot help her now, Doctor.
CLARA: The Tardis. How did she get here?
DALEK SUPREME: It has been procured.
CLARA: Yeah? Yeah, well, if you're trying to get inside, you can't. Nothing can enter the Tardis.
DALEK SUPREME: The Tardis will not be entered. The Tardis will be destroyed.
CLARA:  Yeah, well, good luck, because she's indestructible.
MISSY: Did the Doctor tell you that? Because you should never believe a man about a vehicle.
DOCTOR: What are they going to do? Tell me, what?
DAVROS: Who can say? You know what children are like.
MISSY : Daleks! Pay attention!
DOCTOR:  Don't. Just don't.
MISSY: You know what this is? This thing you're about to destroy? I'll tell you! It's the dog's unmentionables. And you know all about those, don't you?
MISSY: This is a Tardis. With this, you can go anywhere, do anything, kill anyone. With this, the Daleks can be more powerful than ever before.
MISSY: You just need one thing.
DOCTOR:  No. Missy, no!
MISSY: Me. You need me. A Time Lady, to show you how it works. With this and with me, everything can be yours. And you can burn it all, for ever and ever and ever.  Or would you rather just kill me?
DALEK SUPREME: Maximum extermination.
DALEK: Exterminate.
DOCTOR: Please! Please, I'm begging you. Please, please. Please, save Clara.
DAVROS: I gave the Daleks life. I do not control them.
DOCTOR:  Oh, Clara. Oh, my Clara.
DAVROS: See how they play with her. See how they toy. They want her to run. They need her to run. Do you feel their need, Doctor? Their blood is screaming kill, kill, kill! Hunter and prey, held in the ecstasy of crisis. Is this not life at its purest?
DALEK: Exterminate! Exterminate!
DOCTOR: Why have I ever let you live?
DAVROS: Compassion, Doctor. It has always been your greatest indulgence. Let this be my final victory. Let me hear you say it, just once. Compassion is wrong.
DALEK SUPREME: Destroy the Tardis!
DALEKS: Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! 
YOUNG DAVROS: Help me! You can't leave me! You promised. You said I had a chance.
YOUNG DAVROS: Who are you? I don't get it. How did you get there?
DOCTOR: From the future.
YOUNG DAVROS: Are you going to save me?
DOCTOR: I'm going to save my friend the only way I can.
DOCTOR: Exterminate!
