Hell Bent
Nevada USA. A pickup truck drives along a lonely dirt road and pulls up at a snacks and gas stop at Jackson - no matter where you go, there you are. The Doctor gets out of the passenger's side, wearing his sunglasses and with his guitar and a pack slung over his shoulder.
FOXES: ♫ Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball ♫
CLARA: Hi. What can I get you?
DOCTOR: I don't have any money. But I play.
CLARA: Okay.
CLARA: Don't you need to plug that thing in?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
He takes off his sunglasses and places them by the transistor radio, then activates them.)
DOCTOR: You're English.
CLARA: You're not.
DOCTOR: How did you get out here?
CLARA: Magic. Or maybe I went to an airport and caught a plane.
DOCTOR: Ah.
CLARA: You?
DOCTOR: Magic.
CLARA: Is it a sad song?
DOCTOR: Nothing's sad till it's over. Then everything is.
CLARA: What's it called?
DOCTOR: I think that it's called Clara.
CLARA: Tell me about her.
GENERAL: Lord President?
RASSILON: Are all the bells ringing? The whole cloister?
GENERAL: What's going on down there?
GASTRON: On my way down to the Matrix now, sir.
GENERAL : Keep the perimeter. It's okay to be afraid down there, soldier.
GASTRON: Sliders are everywhere, sir. Loads of the things.
GENERAL : Language, please. I'm with the President.
GASTRON: Sorry, sir. The Cloister Wraiths are active.
GENERAL: Do not approach them. Don't even enter the cloister. Just tell me
GENERAL : Are all the bells ringing?
GASTRON: Yes, sir.
RASSILON: Then we are facing great danger.
GENERAL: The Cloister Wraiths seem to think so.
RASSILON: So, where is he? Where has the Doctor gone?
OHILA: Back to the beginning, I should think.
RASSILON: The Sisterhood of Karn has no business in this chamber, or on this planet.
OHILA: I heard the Doctor had come home. One so loves fireworks.
RASSILON: Bah.
WOMAN: Why are they ringing all the bells? Never heard so many. What's gone wrong this time? All the fuss they're always making.
WOMAN: You, up there! You're not supposed to be there! I've just put all that back. It's for the boys, if any of them ever want to come
WOMAN: They'll kill you.
GASTRON : Attention! Will all non-military personnel step away from the Doctor.
GASTRON: I repeat. All non-military personnel, please, step away from the Doctor.
GASTRON: At least move the children away! Doctor
GASTRON: You will lay down any weapons on your person and accompany us to the capital.
GASTRON : Doctor, you will accompany us to the Capitol.
GASTRON : Doctor?
GASTRON: Come back. You will come back immediately.
GASTRON : That is an order and this is a military vehicle.
RASSILON: What's his plan?
OHILA: I think he's finishing his soup.
GENERAL: Suggestion, sir.
GENERAL : We could talk to him.
RASSILON : Words are his weapons.
GENERAL : When did they stop being ours?
GENERAL: Welcome home, sir. As commander of the armed forces of Gallifrey, I bring you the greetings of the High Council.
RASSILON :Who the hell does he think he is?'
GENERAL: The man who won the Time War, sir.
RASSILON: What is he doing? What does he want? Revenge?
OHILA: The Doctor does not blame Gallifrey for the horrors of the Time War.
RASSILON: I should hope not.
OHILA: He just blames you.
DOCTOR: Get off my planet.
RASSILON: We needed to know. You have information about the Hybrid. A danger to all of us. If you'd told us what you knew, you could have walked out of there.
DOCTOR: Get off my planet.
RASSILON: You have nothing, Doctor. Nothing! Do you know what I have, out here in the Dry Lands, where there's nobody who matters?  No witnesses.
DOCTOR:  Me too.
RASSILON: Take aim! Aim at the Doctor. Fire on my command.
GENERAL: Sir?
RASSILON: Step forward and take aim! What's the matter with you?
GENERAL: Lord President, he's a war hero. Some of these men served with him.
RASSILON: These men serve me! All of you! On my command.
RASSILON: Fire!
DOCTOR : Could I have a lemonade?
CLARA: Oh, you like a cliffhanger, don't you? So you went back to your home town
DOCTOR: Something like that. 
CLARA: Glasgow?
DOCTOR: Er, well, sort of Glasgow. Space Glasgow.
CLARA: And there was this gang boss and he wanted to kill you.
DOCTOR: Wanted to, yeah.
RASSILON: You missed. All of you. Every single one of you! How is that possible? What is it? Is the firing squad afraid of the unarmed man?
RASSILON: You, explain.
GASTRON: There was a saying, sir, in the Time War.
RASSILON: A saying?
GASTRON: The first thing you will notice about the Doctor of War is he's unarmed. For many, it's also the last.
GASTRON: I was at Skull Moon, sir.
CLARA: Is this a story or did this really happen?
DOCTOR: Every story ever told really happened. Stories are where memories go when they're forgotten.
RASSILON: Not one more of you moves! That is an order!
RASSILON: A direct order of your President! You leave me no choice.
RASSILON: How many regenerations did we grant you? I've got all night.
RASSILON: Excellent, General. You sent for reinforcements.
DOCTOR: No, he didn't.
DOCTOR: I did.
RASSILON: What? I am Rassilon the redeemer! Rassilon, the resurrected! Gallifrey is mine!
GENERAL: Lord President, with respect, get off his planet.
GENERAL: Gallifrey is currently positioned at the extreme end of the time continuum, for its own protection. We're at the end of the universe, give or take a star system.
DOCTOR: I know. I came the long way round.
GENERAL: The President may not find anywhere to go.
DOCTOR: He's not the President any more.
GENERAL: He was a good man once. Isn't this going a little far?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've barely started. Tell the High Council they're on the next shuttle.
OHILA: I thought I'd find you down here. Old times.
DOCTOR: You're a long way from Karn.
OHILA: At the end of everything, one must expect the company of immortals.
DOCTOR: Do you know what they did to me? A confession dial is a ritual act of purification. It allows a dying Time Lord to face his demons and make his peace, before his mind is uploaded to the Matrix. It was never intended as a torture chamber for the living.
OHILA: Rassilon grew concerned about the coming of the Hybrid.
DOCTOR: Afraid!
OHILA: You were entrapped and imprisoned at his command.
DOCTOR: And look at him now.
OHILA: Why did you banish him? Was it punishment, or for your own protection? Or are you just being cruel? Or just being cowardly?
DOCTOR: Let's see, shall we?
DOCTOR: If you wanted to know about the Hybrid, why didn't you just ask me?
GENERAL: If the Hybrid is a threat to the people of this world, why don't you just tell us?
DOCTOR: What do you know already?
GENERAL: The Hybrid is a legendary
DOCTOR: No.
GENERAL: The Hybrid is a creature thought to be crossbred from two warrior races.
DOCTOR: Which races?
GENERAL: The Daleks and the Time Lords, it is supposed.
DOCTOR: Oh, must be well hard, then.
GENERAL: Unstoppable. According to the stories.
DOCTOR: If they're just stories, why are you so worried?
GENERAL: Some Matrix prophecies suggest
DOCTOR: No.
GENERAL: Many prophesies suggest
DOCTOR: No.
GENERAL: All Matrix prophecies concur that this creature will one day stand in the ruins of Gallifrey. It will unravel the Web of Time and destroy a billion billion hearts to heal its own.
DOCTOR: What colour is it?
GENERAL: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Prophecies, they never tell you anything useful, do they?
OHILA: This is no time to play the fool.
DOCTOR: It's the end of the universe. It's the only time I've got. And you want me to keep you all safe.
GENERAL: Can you?
DOCTOR: I'll need help, obviously.
GENERAL: Gallifrey is at your command.
DOCTOR: Oh, not from you lot. No, you'd cramp my style. Look at your hats. I'm going to need the use of an extraction chamber, to talk to an old friend.
CLARA: Let me be brave.
DOCTOR: This way. I can save you.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
CLARA: Where am I? Is this the Tardis?
DOCTOR: No. This is a planet.
CLARA: What planet?
DOCTOR: Basically, my place.
CLARA: I was about to die. I should be dead.
DOCTOR: Forget about that. It doesn't matter.
CLARA: Hang on, your place?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
CLARA: What do you mean, your place?
DOCTOR: My place.
CLARA: You don't mean?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
CLARA: Gallifrey?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey.
CLARA: Okay. Er, hang on, wait. What? What? Did I miss something?
DOCTOR: Well, we're several billion years in the future and the universe is pretty much over, so, yeah, quite a lot.
GENERAL: Young lady, Miss Oswald, I'm afraid we only have a very few minutes with you.
CLARA: Who's he?
GENERAL: According to the Doctor, you can tell us something about the creature known as the Hybrid.
CLARA: Oh. Oh, that's weird. What's wrong with my ears?
DOCTOR: Nothing.
CLARA: Oh, it's weird. Everything sounds wrong.
DOCTOR: It's a side effect.
CLARA: I can hear you. I can hear you fine. It's like, I don't know, it's like, er. It's like something's missing.
GENERAL: Doctor, we have to tell her. We always tell them.
CLARA: Tell me what? What's he talking about? Doctor? Doctor, what's going on?
DOCTOR: Clara, there's a sound you've been living with every day of your life, but you've learned not to hear.
CLARA: What sound? What's wrong? Just tell me. Doctor, what sound?
DOCTOR: Your heartbeat. Your physical processes have been time looped. Frozen between one heartbeat and the next. Even your breathing is just a habit. You don't need it.
CLARA: If I'm frozen, how can I, how can I be walking about?
DOCTOR: Because the Time Lords are very clever. It doesn't matter.
CLARA: Yes, it matters to me!
GENERAL: Doctor, we have to explain.
CLARA: Doctor, what is going on?
GENERAL: Although you are currently conscious and aware, in fact, you died billions of years ago.
CLARA: Doctor?
GENERAL: We have extracted you at the very end of your time stream to request your help. Once we're finished here, you will be returned to your final moments. Your death is an established historical event and cannot be altered. I'm sorry.
CLARA: Doctor, will you just talk to me!
DOCTOR: I'll try not to break your jaw.
CLARA: My jaw?
DOCTOR: I wasn't talking to you.
GENERAL: Doctor, you can't do this. You know you can't.
DOCTOR: No, General, I don't know that. Everybody, stay exactly where you are! No moving about. On pain of death, no-one take a selfie!
GENERAL: These people are unarmed.
DOCTOR: So are you.
GENERAL: Doctor, I will not let you leave here. That's the sidearm of the President's personal security. There isn't a stun setting.
DOCTOR: I will not let Clara die.
GENERAL: She's been dead for half the lifetime of the universe. If you tried to change that, you could fracture Time itself. Doctor, Lord President, are you really going to take that risk?
CLARA: Doctor. Please, I don't want this. Put it down, please.
DOCTOR: Regeneration?
GENERAL: Tenth.
DOCTOR: Good luck.
GENERAL: You too, sir.
DOCTOR: I want a neural block. Human compatible. Quickly! Come on!
DOCTOR: Come on, quick!
CLARA: This Clara person, you must really like her.
DOCTOR: Why do you say that?
CLARA: You killed a man. You don't seem the type.
CLARA: You killed that man! You shot him! He's dead!
DOCTOR: It was him or you.
CLARA: I don't care!
DOCTOR: Yeah? Well, the difference is, when you die, you stay dead.
CLARA: So does he!
DOCTOR: We're on Gallifrey. Death is Time Lord for man flu.
GASTRON: Med team to sector fifty two, extraction chamber seven. Regeneration in progress.
GASTRON: Are you all right, sir? Oh, er, sorry, ma'am.
GENERAL: Oh, back to normal, am I? The only time I've been a man, that last body. Dear Lord, how do you cope with all that ego?
GASTRON: Ma'am, where's the Doctor?
OHILA: The Cloisters. Where else would he run, except into the greatest danger on Gallifrey.
OHILA : The hell of the Time Lords.
CLARA: I thought you said Gallifrey was frozen in another dimension?
DOCTOR: Well, they must have unfrozen it and come back.
CLARA: How?
DOCTOR: I didn't ask. It would make them feel clever.
DOCTOR: Happy?
CLARA: No. Tell me what a neural block is.
DOCTOR: Never mind. This way.
CLARA: What did you mean, human compatible?
CLARA: So what was it, the thing you took?
DOCTOR: There was only one way to keep Clara safe. I had to wipe some of her memory.
CLARA: Of what?
DOCTOR: Of me.
DOCTOR: The Cloister Wraiths. Sliders, we used to call them. They guard the Matrix. We're safe in here.
CLARA: Why?
DOCTOR: They only attack if you make any attempt to leave.
CLARA: How long are we planning to stay?
DOCTOR: Or, actually, if you try to stay.
CLARA: You realise how well that conversation went, right?
DOCTOR: Starting to, yeah, a bit.
GENERAL: We need to block every exit from the Cloisters. Every available man. I need that place surrounded.
GASTRON: No-one's ever made it back out of the Cloisters.
OHILA: Not quite no-one.
DOCTOR: This way, I'm fairly sure. According to the stories, there's a secret way out. If you find it, the Sliders let you go.
DALEK: Exterminate!
DOCTOR: It's okay. It's okay, look at it.
DALEK: Exterminate me.
CLARA: Is it trapped?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, it's been neutralised. Those aren't vines. In your terms, they're fibre-optic cables, they're alive and growing. We're inside the biggest database in history. Sometimes, people are stupid enough to break in.
CLARA: And?
DOCTOR: It's a database. They get filed.
DALEK:  Exterminate me.
DOCTOR: Probably a leftover from the Cloister Wars. There's nothing we can do. Come on.
DALEK:  Exterminate me. Exterminate me.
DALEK : Exterminate me!
DOCTOR: Keep away from them! The Matrix can use them as a defence. It means the secret exit must be close.
CLARA: What's to defend in a crypt?
DOCTOR: It's not just a crypt. More like a stone circuit board. This is the Matrix database.
CLARA: Database? What do you mean, database?
DOCTOR: Oh.
CLARA: Oh?
DOCTOR: Oh.
CLARA: Oh?
CLARA: Oh.
DOCTOR: Looks like the primary service hatch. Just have to work out the key.
DOCTOR: Oh.
DOCTOR: When Time Lords die, their minds are uploaded to a thing called the Matrix. This structure, it's like a living computer. It can predict the future, generate prophecies out of algorithms, ring the Cloister bells in the event of impending catastrophe. The Sliders, they're just like the guard dogs, the firewall. Projections from inside the Matrix itself. The dead, manning the battlements.
CLARA: Was I supposed to understand any of that?
DOCTOR: The Time Lords have got a big computer made of ghosts, in a crypt, guarded by more ghosts.
CLARA: Didn't hurt, did it?
DOCTOR: Tiny bit.
CLARA: Why would a computer need to protect itself from the people who made it?
DOCTOR: All computers do that in the end. You wait until the internet starts. Oh, that was a war!
GASTRON: They don't seem to be moving.
GENERAL: And they're by lift shaft seven. Keep monitoring.
DOCTOR: A long time ago, there was a student at the Academy. He got in here, disappeared for four days. Showed up in a completely different part of the city. Said the Sliders talked to him, they showed him the secret passage out. And we just need the code.
CLARA: What, and the kid told you the secret?
DOCTOR: Ah, no, he didn't tell anyone anything. He went completely mad. Never right in the head again, so they say.
CLARA: Okay, that's encouraging.
DOCTOR: The last I heard, he stole the moon and the President's wife.
CLARA: Was she, er, Was she nice, the President's wife?
DOCTOR: Ah, well, that was a lie put about by the Shabogans. It was the President's daughter. I didn't steal the moon, I lost it.
CLARA: I'd know you anywhere.
DOCTOR: I was a completely different person in those days. Eccentric, a bit mad, rude to people.
CLARA: Look at me again.
DOCTOR: Sorry, what?
CLARA: In the eye. Look at me. Just do it.
DOCTOR: What? What is it?
CLARA: How long has it been for you since you last saw me?
DOCTOR: Oh, ffr, I'm not sure.
CLARA: How long?
DOCTOR: I was stuck on a place. They
CLARA: They what? Who? Who are we talking about?
DOCTOR: They wanted something from me. Information. It really doesn't matter.
CLARA: What happened to your coat? The velvety coat. I liked that one, it was it was very Doctor-y.
DOCTOR: I changed it.
CLARA: Why?
DOCTOR: Well, I can't be the Doctor all the time.
DOCTOR: I think I've almost got it. I think this is it.
CLARA: Tell me what they did to you. Tell me what happened to the Doctor?
GENERAL: We're here.
GASTRON: It's pretty quiet.
GASTRON : He seems to be talking to her, like he's telling her a story. You might want to have a look.
GENERAL: Open up, we're going in. We'll stick to the perimeter, no more than three paces from the lift. Do not enter the Cloisters.
DOCTOR: Twenty feet of pure diamond. Harder than diamond.
DOCTOR: But you break through anything, given time.
CLARA: How much time?
GENERAL: Miss Oswald.
CLARA: Stay back.
GENERAL: I'm sorry, but we have to find a way to extract you
CLARA: I said, stay back!
CLARA: The Hybrid, what is it? What's so important you would fight so long?
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter what the Hybrid is. It only matters that I convinced them that I knew. Otherwise they'd have kicked me out, I'd have had nothing left to bargain with.
CLARA: What were you bargaining for?
DOCTOR: What do you think? You. I had to find a way to save you. I knew it had to be the Time Lords. They cost you your life on Trap Street, Clara, and I was going to make them bring you back. I just had to hang on in there for a bit.
CLARA: How long?
DOCTOR: It was fine.
CLARA: One question. And you will answer. How long was the Doctor trapped inside the confession dial?
OHILA: We think four and a half billion years.
GENERAL: He could have left any time he wanted. He just had to say what he knew. The dial would have released him.
CLARA: Four and a half billion years?
DOCTOR: If she says so.
CLARA: No. Why would you even do that? I was dead! I was dead and gone. Why? Why would you even do that to yourself?
DOCTOR: I had a duty of care. Listen, I'm nearly through here.  If I'm right, there should be a service duct under here. We'll be able to get to the old workshops. They'll have Tardises there.
CLARA: Okay, listen. I have something I need to say.
DOCTOR: We do not have time.
CLARA: No, my time, my time is up. Doctor, between one heartbeat and the last is all the time I have. People like me and you, we should say things to one another. And I'm going to say them now.
CLARA: You're monsters. Here you are, hiding away at the end of Time. Do you even know why? Because you are hated. You are hated by everybody. But by nobody more than me.
OHILA: What did you say to him?
CLARA: Oh, nothing I'm going to tell you, or anybody else. Except maybe this one part. I said  Don't worry, Doctor. They'll all be looking at me.
GENERAL: You need to tell us what the Doctor is going to do now.
CLARA: You really are thick, aren't you? The Doctor is back on Gallifrey. Took him four and half billion years to get here. What do you think he's going to do now?
CLARA: Why, he's stealing a Tardis and running away. Bye!
CLARA: You were quick.
DOCTOR: Time machine. I backed up a bit.
OHILA : Doctor! Doctor, face me!
OHILA: Doctor, can you hear me?
OHILA : Get out of that Tardis and face me, boy!
CLARA: Boy?
OHILA: You have gone too far. You have broken every code you ever lived by.
DOCTOR: After all this time, after everything I've done, don't you think the universe owes me this?
OHILA: Owes you what? All you're doing is giving her hope.
DOCTOR: Since when is hope a bad thing?
OHILA: Hope is a terrible thing on the scaffold.
GENERAL: Where can he run?
OHILA: Where he always runs. Away. Just away.
DOCTOR: What do you think of the new wheels?
CLARA: Basic.
DOCTOR: Classic! Look at the colour scheme.
CLARA: It's all white.
DOCTOR: Genius!  Check your heartbeat again. I think that you'll find you have one.
CLARA: Yeah?
DOCTOR: It should have restarted when we broke free of Gallifrey's time zone. You're alive! Now we just have to shake off the Time Lords. There's only one place we can do that. What do you say to lunch, followed by breakfast? Because we're time travellers and that's how we roll. Then cocktails with Moses. Then I'm going to invent a flying submarine. Why? Because no one ever has and it's annoying. And maybe we should use this Tardis to find my proper one. I need to change my shirt.
CLARA: Doctor, I still don't have a pulse.
DOCTOR: Oh, you just haven't found it yet. Try again.
CLARA: I know how to take my pulse. Look, I know how to do it. See, no pulse, right?
CLARA: Is it still there? Don't lie to me.
DOCTOR: Er, maybe we just have to fly a little bit further, give it a bit more welly.
CLARA: They said, your lot, that if you saved me, Time would fracture. What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Oh, they're exaggerating. They exaggerate all the time. History will be fine. Time will heal. It always does.
CLARA: Always?
DOCTOR: Yeah. It'll sort itself out. It'll be all right. You'll have a heartbeat. Or don't you trust me any more?
CLARA: No, not when you're shouting. Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Nowhere in space, forward in time. We're going to the last hours of the universe. We're going long past where the Time Lords were hiding. Literally, to the end. They won't be able to track us there. We'll just be there for a minute. I just need to. I need to make an adjustment.
CLARA: To what?
DOCTOR: It's nothing, really. It's this.
CLARA: The neural block. Human compatible, that's what you said.
DOCTOR: We don't have to stay here long. Er check your heartbeat again. Your timeline must have started by now. A pulse, yeah? You have a pulse, yes? Pulse? Let me do it.
CLARA: I am checking it properly!
DOCTOR: This should work. This has got to work.
CLARA: What if one last heartbeat is all I've got? What if Time isn't healing? What if the universe needs me to die?
DOCTOR: The universe is over! It doesn't have a say any more! We're standing on the last ember, the last fragment of everything that ever was. As of this moment, I'm answerable to no-one!
CLARA: How can there be anybody there?
DOCTOR: Four knocks. It's always four knocks.
DOCTOR: No. This one I do alone.
CLARA: What's out there?
DOCTOR: Me.
DOCTOR: I told you once, so long ago, that the universe would become a very small place when I'm angry with you. Small enough for you yet?
DOCTOR: Hello, me.
ASHILDR: You don't seem surprised to see me.
DOCTOR: At the end of everything, we should expect the company of immortals, so I've been told.
ASHILDR: Even the other immortals are gone. It's just me.
DOCTOR: The one and only me. Finally, you earn the title, sitting here in a reality bubble at the end of Time itself. How are you sustaining it, by the way?
ASHILDR: Brilliantly. I've been watching the stars die. It was beautiful.
DOCTOR: No. It was sad.
ASHILDR: No, it was both. But that's not something you would understand, is it? You don't like endings. She died, Doctor. Clara died billions of years ago.
DOCTOR: You killed her.
ASHILDR: No.
DOCTOR: You let it happen.
ASHILDR: No, I didn't. Neither did you. She did. She died for who she was and who she loved. She fell where she stood. It was sad, and it was beautiful. And it is over. We have no right to change who she was.
DOCTOR: Ashildr
ASHILDR: Me.
DOCTOR: Me, go to hell. By my calculations, you've got about five minutes.
ASHILDR: You know why we run, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Because it's fun.
ASHILDR: Because we know summer can't last forever.
DOCTOR: Of course it can. Of course it can. You just have to steal a time machine.
ASHILDR: The Hybrid. Five minutes to hell. I think it's time to tell the truth.
CLARA: Screen on.
ASHILDR : You were barely more than a child. You broke in here and the Wraiths spoke to you about the Hybrid. Why did that story make you so scared?
DOCTOR : I don't know. I don't remember it.
ASHILDR: Sometimes you do. It's always the way with things we'd rather forget. You remember now, though, don't you? Tell me, Doctor, who is the Hybrid? Who threatens all of Time and Space?
DOCTOR: Oh, but that's easy. That's very, very easy. The Hybrid is you.
ASHILDR : I'm human, with a little bit of Mire inside me. The Hybrid is supposed to be half Time Lord, half Dalek.
DOCTOR : No, it isn't.
DOCTOR: The actual prophecy specifies only two warrior races. The Daleks and the Time Lords have made assumptions, of course. And they would. Humans and the Mire, both warrior races. It fits perfectly.
ASHILDR: It's an interesting theory.
DOCTOR: Do you have a better one?
ASHILDR: By your own reasoning, why couldn't the Hybrid be half Time Lord, half human? Tell me, Doctor, I've always wondered. You're a Time Lord, you're a high-born Gallifreyan. Why is it you spend so much time on Earth?
DOCTOR: That's your best theory? I'm the Hybrid? I ran away from Gallifrey because I was afraid of myself? That doesn't make any sense.
ASHILDR: It makes perfect sense, and you know it. Am I right? Is it true?
DOCTOR: Does it matter?
ASHILDR: No. Because I have a better theory.
DOCTOR: Really?
ASHILDR: What if the Hybrid wasn't one person, but two?
DOCTOR: Two?
ASHILDR: A dangerous combination of a passionate and powerful Time Lord and a young woman so very similar to him.
ASHILDR : Companions who are willing to push each other to extremes.
DOCTOR : She's my friend. She's just my friend.
ASHILDR : How did you meet her?
CLARA: Missy!
DOCTOR: Missy.
ASHILDR: Missy. The Master. The lover of chaos, who wants you to love it, too. She's quite the matchmaker.
DOCTOR: Clara's my friend.
ASHILDR: I know. And you're willing to risk all of Time and Space because you miss her. One wonders what the pair of you will get up to next.
DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing at all. I know I went too far. I get it. That's why I'm doing what I'm doing.
ASHILDR: And what would that be?
DOCTOR: I'm taking her back to Earth. Somewhere safe, somewhere out of the way. I'm going to wipe her memory of every last detail of me.
DOCTOR : It'll be like our friendship never happened.
ASHILDR : That may not be what she wants.
DOCTOR : 'I've done it before. Usually, I do it telepathically, but this time, I've got something better.
DOCTOR: It's quite painless.
ASHILDR: Will you tell her what you're going to do?
DOCTOR: Of course.
ASHILDR: When?
DOCTOR: Now.
CLARA: Screen off.
DOCTOR: You okay?
CLARA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Just, you know, my pulse.
DOCTOR: Yeah, we'll fix that somehow. I promise. You remember Ashildr, of course.
CLARA: Yeah, sure.
DOCTOR: I thought you'd be more surprised to see her.
CLARA: I was watching. On the monitor.
CLARA: No. Doctor, whatever you're about to do, don't do it.
DOCTOR: It won't hurt, it'll be nothing. You'll just pass out for a moment.
CLARA: And then?
DOCTOR: When you wake, you'll be fine.
CLARA: But
DOCTOR: Clara, just listen to me.
CLARA: Just say it. Say it. Come on. Tell me.
DOCTOR: When you wake up, you will have forgotten me. You'll have forgotten we ever even met.
CLARA: And why would I want that?
DOCTOR: Because it's the only way. That stuff in your head, the image of me, they could use it to find you.
CLARA: I, er I used these.
DOCTOR: On what?
CLARA: That.
DOCTOR: What did you do?
CLARA: What do you think? Ashildr's right, you see? We're too alike.
DOCTOR: Tell me what you did.
CLARA: What else? What else do you think I did? I reversed the polarity. Push that button, Doctor, it will go off in your own face.
DOCTOR: You were trying to trick me?
CLARA: What were you doing to me?
DOCTOR: I'm trying to keep you safe.
CLARA: Why? Nobody's ever safe. I've never asked you for that, ever. These have been the best years of my life, and they are mine. Tomorrow is promised to no one, Doctor, but I insist upon my past. I am entitled to that. It's mine.
DOCTOR: Oh, Clara Oswald. What am I doing? You're right. You're always, always right.
CLARA: So what happens now? Hey? Me and you, what do we do now?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure you managed to reverse the polarity. I'm not even sure that you can. It'll do something to one of us. Better than flipping a coin.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: You and me together. Look how far I went, for fear of losing you. This has to stop. One of us has to go.
CLARA: You really don't know which?
DOCTOR: Let's find out. Let's do it like we've done everything else. Together.
CLARA: How about we just don't? Why don't we just fly away somewhere?
DOCTOR: Oh, that'd be great, wouldn't it?
CLARA: God, yeah.
DOCTOR: Good luck, Clara.
CLARA: Good luck, Doctor.
CLARA: So, what happens now?
DOCTOR: I suppose, we just, er, we just wait a minute, I suppose.
CLARA: And one of us, One of us will. I don't think I could ever forget you.
DOCTOR: Clara, I don't think you're ever going to have to.
CLARA: No.
DOCTOR: Run like hell.
CLARA: What?
DOCTOR: Run like hell, because you always need to. Laugh at everything, because it's always funny.
CLARA: No. Stop it. You're saying goodbye. Don't say goodbye!
DOCTOR: Never be cruel and never be cowardly. And if you ever are, always make amends.
CLARA: Stop it! Stop this. Stop it!
DOCTOR: Never eat pears. They're too squishy and they always make your chin wet. That one's quite important. Write it down.
CLARA: I didn't mean to do this. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It's okay. It's okay. I went too far. I broke all my own rules. I became the Hybrid. This is right. I accept it.
CLARA: I can't. There has to be something I can do.
DOCTOR: Smile for me. Go on, Clara Oswald, one last time.
CLARA: How could I smile?
DOCTOR: It's okay. Don't you worry. I'll remember it.
PLUMP MAN: Sir? Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Where am I?
DOCTOR: How did I get here?
PLUMP MAN: Clara asked me to look after you. She said you might be a bit upset.
DOCTOR: Clara?
PLUMP MAN: Yeah. She was just here.
PLUMP MAN: I don't know where she went.
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara who?
DOCTOR: When something goes missing, you can always recreate it by the hole it left. I know her name was Clara. I know we travelled together. I know that there was an Ice Warrior on a submarine and a mummy on the Orient Express. I know we sat together in the Cloisters and she told me something very important, but I have no idea what she said. Or what she looked like. Or how she talked. Or laughed. There's nothing there. Just nothing.
CLARA: Are you looking for her?
DOCTOR: I'm trying.
CLARA: She could be anyone, right? You don't know who you're looking for. I mean, she could be me, for all you know.
DOCTOR: There's one thing I know about her. Just one thing. If I met her again, I would absolutely know.
I think that we were here, you know? I think that we were here together once. I'm sure I'll remember. Over here.
DOCTOR: Stupid Doctor. Amy and Rory. It was Amy and Rory.
CLARA: What about your Tardis, hey? Have you found that yet?
DOCTOR: No. Somebody's moved it from London. I'm still looking. But this diner. It wasn't always here, was it? It used to be on the other side of the hill.
CLARA: Well, maybe someone will find your Tardis for you.
CLARA: What Clara told you in the Cloisters
DOCTOR: I don't remember a single thing about it.
CLARA: You said memories become stories when we forget them. Maybe some of them become songs.
DOCTOR: That would be nice.
CLARA: Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?
ASHILDR: I don't think I've got the Chameleon circuit working. The outer shell might be stuck as an American Diner.
CLARA: Awesome.
ASHILDR: Still no pulse?
CLARA: Time isn't healing. I am still frozen.
ASHILDR: You know what that means?
CLARA: It means my death is a fixed event. The universe depends on it happening.
ASHILDR: I'm sorry.
CLARA: Why? Why does everybody think I am so scared? We all face the raven in the end. That is the deal. If I go back to Gallifrey, they can put me back, right? On Trap Street, the moment they took me out?
ASHILDR: Of course.
CLARA: Mind you, seeing as I'm not actually ageing, there's a tiny little bit of wiggle room, isn't there?
ASHILDR: Wiggle room?
CLARA: Wiggle room. Yeah, you know, wiggle room. We could, er, you know, stop off on the way.
ASHILDR: Where are we going?
CLARA: Gallifrey. Like I said, Gallifrey. The long way round.
