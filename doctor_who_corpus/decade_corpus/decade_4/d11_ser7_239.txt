The Name of the Doctor
She Said, He Said - a prequel by Steven Moffat
CLARA: One day you meet the Doctor. And of course, it's the best day ever. It's just the best day of your life. Because, because he's brilliant, and he's funny, and mad, and best of all, he really needs you. The trick is, don't fall in love. I do that trick quite a lot, sometimes twice a day. And once you start running, you start to forget, slowly. After a while, you just stop asking. Who are you? Where are you from? What set you on your way and where are you going? Oh, and what is your name? You get used to not knowing. I thought I never would. I was wrong. I know who he is. I know how he began and I know where he's going. I know the truth about the Doctor and his greatest secret. The day we went to Trenzalore.
DOCTOR: From the beginning, she was impossible. The Impossible Girl. I met her in the Dalek Asylum. Never saw her face, and she died. I met her again in Victorian London, and she died. Saved my life both times, by giving her own. But now she's back and we're running together, and she's perfect. Perfect in every way for me. Except she can't remember that we ever met. Clara. My Clara. Always brave, always funny, always exactly what I need. Perfect. Too perfect. Get used to not knowing. I thought I never would. I was wrong. I know who Clara Oswald is. I know how she came to be in my life, and I know what she will always mean. I found out the day we went to Trenzalore.
ANDRO: Something wrong?
FABIAN: It's the repair shop. What kind of idiot would steal a faulty Tardis?
CLARA: Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR 1: Yes, what is it? What do you want?
CLARA: Sorry, but you're about to make a very big mistake.
CLARA : I don't know where I am. It's like I'm breaking into a million pieces and there's only one thing I remember. I have to save the Doctor. He always looks different.
CLARA: Doctor!
CLARA : But I always know it's him. Sometimes I think I'm everywhere at once, running every second just to find him.
CLARA: Doctor!
CLARA : Just to save him.
CLARA: Doctor!
CLARA: Doctor?
CLARA : But he never hears me.
CLARA: Oi.
CLARA : Almost never. I blew into this world on a leaf.
CLARA : I'm still blowing. I don't think I'll ever land. I'm Clara Oswald. I'm the Impossible Girl. I was born to save the Doctor.
DeMARCO: Do you hear the Whisper Men? The Whisper Men are near. If you hear the Whisper Men, then turn away your ear. Do not hear the Whisper men, whatever else you do. For once you've heard the Whisper Men, they'll stop and look at you. One word from you could save me from the rope.
VASTRA: Then you may rely on my silence.
DeMARCO: I have information. Valuable information.
VASTRA: Are you bargaining for your life? You have the blood of fourteen women on your hands. There are no words you can speak that will save your neck.
DeMARCO: The Doctor. Ah, yes. I know all about him, your dangerous friend.
VASTRA: How?
DeMARCO: In the babble of the world, there are whispers, if you know how to listen. The Doctor has a secret, you know.
VASTRA: He has many.
DeMARCO: He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered. Well?
JENNY: We can't let that terrible man live.
VASTRA: He lives till I understand what he told me. We're going to need a conference call. I'll send out the invitations, you fetch the candles.
JENNY: Yes, ma'am.
VASTRA: Where's Strax got to?
JENNY: The usual. It's his weekend off.
VASTRA: I wish he'd never discovered that place.
STRAX : Sontar-ha! Sontar-ha!
ARCHIE: Come here while I kill ye, ya filthy wee midden.
STRAX: Prepare to die in agony for the glory of the Sontaran Empire!
MESSENGER BOY: Excuse me. Mister Strax?
STRAX: What is it, girl? Can't you see I'm trying to crush the brains of this stinking primitive? Sorry about this.
ARCHIE: No problem.
MESSENGER BOY: It's a telegram, sir. Very urgent.
STRAX: Conference call. Sorry, Archie. I'm going to have to ask you to render me unconscious.
ARCHIE: Fine.
STRAX: Better use this.
STRAX: It might take a while.
VASTRA: Sleep well, my love.
JENNY: You too.
WHISPER : The trap is set for the Doctor's friends. They will travel where the Doctor ends.
JENNY: Oh, I like the new desktop.
VASTRA: I was getting a little bored of the Taj Mahal. The tea should be superb. It's drawn from one of my favourite memories. Strax, good of you to join us.
STRAX: It had better be important. I was in the middle of destroying some very pleasant primitives.
VASTRA: I apologise for the interruption, but there is urgent news concerning the Doctor.
STRAX: Who else is coming?
VASTRA: The women.
ANGIE: Oh, no. You're going to try and make a soufflé again, aren't you?
CLARA: My mum's soufflé, yeah. Although this time I'll get it right. This time I will be Soufflé Girl.
ARTIE: How can it be your mum's soufflé if you're making it?
CLARA: Because, Artie, it's like my mum always said. The soufflé isn't the soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe.
ANGIE: Was your mum deep on puddings?
CLARA: She was a great woman.
CLARA: What's this?
ANGIE: Oh, it arrived today. It's for you.
VASTRA : My dearest Clara. The Doctor entrusted me with your contact details in the event of an emergency, and I fear one has now arisen. Assuming this letter will have reached you as planned, on April the tenth, 2013, please find and light the enclosed candle. It will release a soporific which will induce a trance state, enabling direct communication across the years. However, as I realise you have no reason to trust this letter, I have taken the liberty of embedding the same soporific into the fabric of the paper you are now holding. Speak soon.
VASTRA: So glad you could make it.
CLARA: Where am I?
JENNY: Exactly where you were, but sleeping.
VASTRA: Time travel has always been possible in dreams. We are awaiting only one more participant.
STRAX: Oh, no. Not the one with the gigantic head?
JENNY: It's hair, Strax.
STRAX: Hair.
RIVER: Madame Vastra.
VASTRA: Professor. Help yourself to some tea.
RIVER: Why, thank you.
JENNY: How did you do that?
RIVER: Disgracefully.
VASTRA: Ah. Perhaps you two haven't met. This is the Doctor's companion. That is, his current travelling assistant.
CLARA: Assistant?
STRAX: Have you gone a darker green?
VASTRA: Clara Oswald.
RIVER: Professor River Song. The Doctor might have mentioned me?
CLARA: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, of course he has. Professor Song. Sorry, it's just I never realised you were a woman.
STRAX: Well, neither did I.
VASTRA: Perhaps we should get down to the business at hand.
JENNY: That might be good, dear, yes.
VASTRA: Clarence DeMarco. Murderer, under sentence of death. He offered us this in exchange for his life.
RIVER: Space time coordinates.
VASTRA: This, Mister DeMarco claims, is the location of the Doctor's greatest secret.
CLARA: Which is?
JENNY: We don't know. It's a secret.
VASTRA: The Doctor does not discuss his secrets with anyone, my dear. If you're still entertaining the idea that you are an exception to this rule, ask yourself one question. What is his name?
RIVER: Well, I know it.
CLARA: What, you know his name? He told you?
RIVER: I made him.
CLARA: How?
RIVER: It took a while.
CLARA: So you're a friend of his, then?
RIVER: A little more than a friend, a long time ago.
VASTRA: He's still never contacted you?
RIVER: He doesn't like endings.
RIVER: So what else did this DeMarco tell you? He didn't just buy his life with some coordinates. How did he prove their value?
VASTRA: One word, only.
RIVER: What word?
VASTRA: A word I've heard in connection with the Doctor before. Trenzalore.
RIVER: How exactly did he describe what he was giving you?
HOLO-DeMARCO: The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered.
RIVER: You misunderstood.
JENNY: Ma'am, I'm sorry. I just realise I forgot to lock the doors.
VASTRA: It doesn't matter, Jenny. What misunderstanding? Tell me.
JENNY: No, ma'am, please. I should've locked up before we went into the trance.
VASTRA: Jenny, it doesn't matter!
JENNY: Someone's broken in. Someone's with us. I can hear them.
VASTRA: Jenny, are you all right?
JENNY: Sorry, ma'am. So sorry. So sorry. So sorry. I think I've been murdered.
VASTRA: Jenny!
CLARA: What's happened to her.
RIVER: Jenny, can you hear me?
STRAX: Speak to us, boy!
VASTRA: Jenny!
RIVER: You're under attack. You must wake up now. Just wake up. Do it!
 
VASTRA: Who are you? What have you done to her?
RIVER: You too, Strax. Wake up now!
WHISPER MEN: Tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor. Tell the Doctor.
CLARA: Tell him what?
HOLO-SIMEON: His friends are lost for ever more, unless he goes to Trenzalore.
RIVER: No! You can't say that. He can't go there. You know he can't.
DOCTOR : Angie? Artie?
RIVER: The Doctor can never go to Trenzalore.
DOCTOR : Am I getting warm?
DOCTOR: Angie? Artie? Am I getting warm? Am I getting warm?
DOCTOR: Am I getting warm? Look, I'm pretty sure you have to tell me if I'm getting warm. I'm, I'm, I'm pretty sure that's in the rules.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ha! Clara. How are you? Don't worry, everything is under control.
CLARA: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Oh. Mister Maitland went next door, so I said I'd look after the kids. They wanted to go to the cinema, but I said no. I said no, not until you wake up. I was very firm.
CLARA: At which point they suggested Blind Man's Buff.
DOCTOR: Yes. Where are they?
CLARA: At the cinema.
DOCTOR: The little Daleks. What's wrong?
CLARA: So who was she, the lady with the funny name and the space hair?
DOCTOR: An old friend of mine.
CLARA: What, like an ex?
DOCTOR: Yes, an ex. River asked Vastra for the exact words. What were they?
CLARA: The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It is discovered. Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sorry. And it was Trenzalore? Definitely Trenzalore?
CLARA: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh dear. Sorry.
CLARA: Well?
DOCTOR: Trenzalore. I've heard the name, of course. Dorium mentioned it. A few others. Always suspected what it was, never wanted to find out myself. River would know, though. River always knew. Right, come here. Give me your hand. Now, the coordinates you saw will still be in your memory. I'm linking you into the Tardis telepathic circuit. Won't hurt a bit.
CLARA: Ow!
DOCTOR: I lied.
CLARA: Okay, what is Trenzalore? Is that your big secret?
DOCTOR: No.
CLARA: Okay, what then?
DOCTOR: When you are a time traveller, there is one place you must never go. One place in all of space and time you must never, ever find yourself.
CLARA: Where?
DOCTOR: You didn't listen, did you? You lot never do. That's the problem. The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave. It is discovered. He wasn't talking about my secret. No, no, no, that's not what's been found. He was talking about my grave. Trenzalore is where I'm buried.
CLARA: How can you have a grave?
DOCTOR: Because we all do, somewhere out there in the future, waiting for us.
DOCTOR: The trouble with time travel, you can actually end up visiting.
CLARA: But you're not going to. You just said it's the one place you must never go.
DOCTOR: I have to save Vastra and Strax. Jenny too, if it's still possible. They, they cared for me during the dark times. Never questioned me, never judged me, they were just kind. I owe them. I have a duty. No point in telling you this is too dangerous.
CLARA: None at all. How can we save them?
DOCTOR: Apparently, by breaking into my own tomb.
CLARA: What's that?
DOCTOR: She's just figured out where we're going. She's against it. I'm about to cross my own timeline in the biggest way possible. The Tardis doesn't like it. She's fighting it. Hang on! Hang on!
CLARA: Now what?
DOCTOR: She doesn't want to land. She's shut down.
CLARA: So we're not there?
DOCTOR: We must be close.
DOCTOR: Okay, so that's where I end up.
DOCTOR: Always thought maybe I'd retire. Take up watercolours or bee-keeping, or something. Apparently not.
CLARA: So, how do we get down there? Jump?
DOCTOR: Don't be silly. We fall.
DOCTOR: She's turned off practically everything, except the anti-gravs. Guess what I'm turning off.
DOCTOR: Oops.
CLARA: You okay? You're visiting your own grave. Anyone would be scared.
DOCTOR: It's more than that. I'm a time traveller. I've probably time-travelled more than anyone else.
CLARA: Meaning?
DOCTOR: Meaning my grave is potentially the most dangerous place in the universe. Shall we?
CLARA: Gravestones are a big basic?
DOCTOR: It's a battlefield graveyard. My final battle.
CLARA: Why are some of them bigger?
DOCTOR: They're soldiers. The bigger the gravestone, the higher the rank.
CLARA: It's a hell of a monument.
DOCTOR: It's the Tardis.
CLARA: I can see that.
DOCTOR: No. When a Tardis is dying, sometimes the dimension dams start breaking down. They used to call it a size leak. All the bigger on the inside starts leaking to the outside. It grows. When I say that's the Tardis, I don't mean it looks like the Tardis, I mean it actually is the Tardis. My Tardis from the future. What else would they bury me in?
RIVER: Clara. Don't speak, don't say my name. He can't see or hear me. Only you can.
DOCTOR : Well, come on, then.
RIVER: We're mentally linked. It's the conference call. I kept the line open.
DOCTOR: Who are you talking to? We need to get. River.
CLARA: That can't be right.
DOCTOR: No, it can't.
CLARA: She's not dead.
DOCTOR: Oh, she's dead, I'm afraid. She's been dead for a very long time.
RIVER: Yeah, probably should have mentioned that. Never the right time.
CLARA: But I met her.
DOCTOR: Long story. But her grave can't be here.
CLARA: Doctor!
WHISPER MEN: This man must fall as all men must. The fate of all is always dust.
RIVER: If it isn't my gravestone, then what is it?
CLARA: What do you think that gravestone really is?
DOCTOR: The gravestone?
RIVER: Maybe it's a false grave.
CLARA: Maybe it's a false grave.
DOCTOR: Yeah, maybe.
RIVER: Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb.
CLARA: Maybe it's a secret entrance to the tomb!
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Makes sense. They'd never bury my wife out here.
CLARA: Your what?
WHISPER MEN: The man who lies will lie no more when this man lies at Trenzalore.
STRAX: This base is surrounded! Lay down your weapons and your deaths will be merciful!
VASTRA: Jenny. Jenny!
STRAX: This planet is now property of the Sontaran Empire. Surrender your women and intellectuals.
VASTRA: Strax, please! She's dead.
STRAX: No heart beat. Complete cardio-collapse, shock induced.
VASTRA: Get her back for me. Get her back for me now or I will cut you into pieces.
STRAX: Unhand me, ridiculous reptile.
STRAX: There we go. Just a standard electro-cardio restart. She'll be fine.
VASTRA: Are you all right, my love? Can you hear me?
STRAX: The heart is a relatively simple thing.
VASTRA: I have not found it to be so.
SIMEON: I see you have repaired your pet. No matter. I was only attracting your attention. I presume I have it.
VASTRA: Doctor Simeon. This is not possible.
SIMEON: And yet here we are, meeting again, so very far from home.
JENNY: But he died. You told me.
VASTRA: Simeon died, but the creature that possessed him lived on. I take it I am now talking to the Great Intelligence?
SIMEON: Welcome to the final resting place of the cruel tyrant. Of the slaughterer of the ten billion, and the vessel of the final darkness. Welcome to the tomb of the Doctor.
CLARA: Where are we?
DOCTOR: Catacombs.
CLARA: I hate catacombs. So how come I met your dead wife?
DOCTOR: Oh well, you know how it is when you lose someone close to you. I sort of made a back-up.
RIVER: I died saving him. In return, he saved me to a database in the biggest library in the universe. Left me like a book on a shelf. Didn't even say goodbye. He doesn't like endings.
DOCTOR: Clara, come on! Run, run!
SIMEON: It was a minor skirmish, by the Doctor's blood-soaked standards. Not exactly the Time War, but enough to finish him. In the end, it was too much for the old man.
JENNY: Blood-soaked?
VASTRA: The Doctor has been many things, but never blood-soaked.
SIMEON: Tell that to the leader of the Sycorax, or Solomon the trader, or the Cybermen, or the Daleks. The Doctor lives his life in darker hues, day upon day, and he will have other names before the end. The Storm, the Beast, the Valeyard.
VASTRA: Even if any of this were true, which I take the liberty of doubting, how did you come by this information?
SIMEON: I am information.
JENNY: You were a mind without a body last time we met.
VASTRA: And you were supposed to stay that way.
SIMEON: Alas, I did.
SIMEON: As you can see.
DOCTOR: Come on, quickly, we're in.
CLARA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Clara!
DOCTOR: Yowzah.
DOCTOR: Still a bit of a climb. I think I remember the way. Clara? Clara.
DOCTOR: Hey, it's okay. You're fine. The dimensioning forces this deep in the Tardis, they can make you a bit giddy.
CLARA: I know, I know. How do I know? How do I know that?
DOCTOR: Clara, it's okay. You're fine.
CLARA: Have we, have we done this before? We have. We have done this before. Climbing through a wrecked Tardis.
CLARA: You said things, things I'm not supposed to remember.
DOCTOR: We can't do this now. The Tardis is a ruin. The telepathic circuits are awakening memories you shouldn't even have. 
DOCTOR : Why do I keep meeting you?
DOCTOR: Clara.
DOCTOR : The Dalek Asylum. There was a girl in a shipwreck and she died saving my life. And she was you.
DOCTOR: Clara.
DOCTOR : In Victorian London there was a governess, who was really a barmaid, and she died. And she was you.
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara, what's wrong?
CLARA: What do you mean, you keep meeting me? You said I died. How could I die?
DOCTOR: That is not a conversation you should even remember.
CLARA: What do you mean I died?
WHISPER MEN: The girl who died he tried to save. She'll die again inside his grave.
DOCTOR: Run. Run!
SIMEON: The doors require a key. The key is a word. And the word is the Doctor's.
DOCTOR: Here I am, late to my own funeral. Glad you could make it. Jenny.
SIMEON: Open the door, Doctor. Speak, and open your tomb.
DOCTOR: No.
SIMEON: Because you know what's in there?
DOCTOR: I will not open those doors.
SIMEON: The key is a word lost to time. A secret hidden in the deepest shadow and know to you alone. The answer to a question.
DOCTOR: I will not open my tomb.
SIMEON: Doctor, what is your name? The Doctor's friends. Stop their hearts.
STRAX: Madam, boys, combat formation. They are unarmed.
JENNY: So are we!
STRAX: Do not divulge our military secrets.
DOCTOR: Stop this. Leave them alone.
SIMEON: Your name, Doctor. Answer me.
CLARA: Doctor?
STRAX: Do you want me to do that again?
SIMEON: Doctor who?
DOCTOR: Please, stop it.
SIMEON: Doctor who?
STRAX: Unhand me, sir. Argh.
DOCTOR: Leave him alone. Let him be.
STRAX: Don't worry, sir. I think I've got him rattled.
CLARA: Doctor! Doctor!
SIMEON: Doctor who?
DOCTOR: Please!
RIVER: The Tardis can still hear me. Lucky thing, since him indoors is being so useless.
STRAX: Why did you open the door, sir? I had them on the run.
DOCTOR: I didn't do it. I didn't say my name.
RIVER: No, but I did.
DOCTOR: Is everyone all right? Is everyone okay? Clara? Clara? Clara, are you okay?
CLARA: That was not nice.
DOCTOR: I know. I'm sorry. Now then, Doctor Simeon, or Mister G Intelligence, whatever I call you, do you know what's in there?
SIMEON: For me, peace at last. For you, pain everlasting. Won't you invite us in?
CLARA: What's that?
DOCTOR: What were you expecting, a body? Bodies are boring. I've had loads of them. Nah, that's not what my tomb is for.
VASTRA: But what is the light?
JENNY: It's beautiful.
STRAX: Should I destroy it?
VASTRA: Shut up, Strax.
CLARA: Doctor, explain. What is that?
DOCTOR: The tracks of my tears.
SIMEON: Less poetry, Doctor. Just tell them.
DOCTOR: Time travel is damage. It's like a tear in the fabric of reality. That is the scar tissue of my journey through the universe. My path through time and space from Gallifrey to Trenzalore.
DOCTOR 1 : Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the fourth dimension?
DOCTOR 4 : Do I have the right?
DOCTOR 6 : Daleks, Cybermen, they're still in the nursery compared to us.
DOCTOR 2 : There are corners of the universe that have bred the most dangerous things.
DOCTOR 9 : You were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
DOCTOR 10 : I'm the Doctor. I'm from Gallifrey in the constellation of Kasterborous
DOCTOR 11 : Hello, Stonehenge!
DOCTOR: My own personal time tunnel. All the days,
DOCTOR 3 : It was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen.
DOCTOR: Even the ones that I, er, even the ones that I haven't lived yet.
CLARA: Doctor. Doctor!
DOCTOR: No, no. Which is why I shouldn't be here. The paradoxes. It's very bad.
DOCTOR: No. No. No. What are you doing? Somebody stop him!
SIMEON: The Doctor's life is a open wound. And an open wound can be entered.
DOCTOR: No, it would destroy you.
SIMEON: Not at all. It will kill me. It will destroy you. I can rewrite your every living moment. I can turn every one of you victories into defeats. Poison every friendship. Deliver pain to your every breath.
DOCTOR: It will burn you up. Once you go through, you can't come back. You will be scattered along my timeline like confetti.
SIMEON: It matters not, Doctor. You thwarted me at every turn. Now you will give me peace, as I take my revenge on every second of your life. Goodbye. Goodbye, Doctor.
CLARA: What's wrong with him? What's happening?
VASTRA: He's being rewritten. Simeon is attacking his entire timeline. He's dying all at once. The Dalek Asylum. Androzani.
CLARA: What did you say? Did you say the Dalek Asylum?
VASTRA: Now he's dying in London, with us.
SIMEON : It is done.
VASTRA: Oh, dear Goddess.
JENNY: What's wrong?
VASTRA: A universe without the Doctor. There will be consequences. Jenny, with me.
CLARA: The Dalek Asylum. You said it was me that saved you. How? Victorian London. How, how could I have been in Victorian London?
DOCTOR: No. Please, stop. My life, my whole life is burning.
JENNY: What are you scanning for?
VASTRA: Local star systems.
STRAX: Why?
VASTRA: Because they're disappearing.
JENNY: Disappearing how?
VASTRA: The Doctor's timeline has been corrupted. His every victory reversed. Think how many lives that man saved. How many worlds. He saved your life when we met. Jenny?
VASTRA: Please, Jenny, no! Oh God, oh please, no.
STRAX: Reptile scum.
STRAX: You are an affront to Sontaran purity. Prepare to perish!
VASTRA: We're friends. Strax, your past is changing, but I swear, we are comrades!
STRAX: Die, reptile.
VASTRA: Strax! Strax!
CLARA: I have to go in there.
DOCTOR: Please, please, no.
CLARA: But this is what I've already done. You've already seen me do it. I'm the Impossible Girl, and this is why.
RIVER: Whatever you're thinking of doing, don't.
CLARA: If I step in there, what happens?
RIVER: The time winds will tear you into a million pieces. A million versions of you, living and dying all over time and space, like echoes.
CLARA: But the echoes could save the Doctor, right?
RIVER: But they won't be you. The real you will die. They'll just be copies.
CLARA: But they'll be real enough to save him. It's like my mum said. The soufflé isn't the soufflé, the soufflé is the recipe. It's the only way to save him, isn't it?
VASTRA: The stars are going out. And Jenny and Strax are dead. There must be something we can do.
CLARA: Well, how about that? I'm soufflé girl after all.
DOCTOR: No. Please.
CLARA: If this works, get out of here as fast as you can. And spare me a thought now and then.
DOCTOR: No, Clara.
CLARA: In fact, you know what? Run. Run, you clever boy, and remember me.
DOCTOR: No. Clara!
CLARA : I don't know where I am.
DOCTOR: Clara!
CLARA : I just know I'm running. Sometimes it's like I've lived a thousand lives in a thousand places. I'm born, I live, I die. And always, there's the Doctor. Always I'm running to save the Doctor again and again and again. Oi! And he hardly ever hears me. But I've always been there.
CLARA: Doctor?
DOCTOR 1: Yes, what is it? What do you want?
CLARA : Right from the very beginning.
CLARA: Sorry, but you're about to make a very big mistake. Don't steal that one, steal this one. The navigation system's knackered, but you'll have much more fun.
CLARA : Right from the day he started running.
CLARA : Run, you clever boy.
CLARA: And remember me.
STRAX: It was an unprovoked and violent attack, but that's no excuse.
VASTRA: We're all restored. That's all that matters now.
DOCTOR: We are not all restored.
RIVER: You can't go in there. It's your own time stream, for God's sake.
DOCTOR: I have to get her back.
RIVER: Of course, but not like this.
JENNY: But how?
VASTRA: Is she still alive? It killed Doctor Simeon.
DOCTOR: Clara's got one advantage over the Great Intelligence.
VASTRA: Which is?
DOCTOR: Me.
RIVER: Doctor, please listen to me. At least hear me.
DOCTOR: Now, if I don't come back, and I might not
RIVER: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Go to the Tardis. The fast return protocols should be on. She'll take you home, then shut herself down.
RIVER: There has to be another way. Use the Tardis, use something. Save her, yes, but for God's sake be sensible.
RIVER: How are you even doing that? I'm not really here.
DOCTOR: You are always here to me. And I always listen, and I can always see you.
RIVER: Then why didn't you speak to me?
DOCTOR: Because I thought it would hurt too much.
RIVER: I believe I could have coped.
DOCTOR: No, I thought it would hurt me. And I was right.
DOCTOR: Since nobody else in this room can see you, God knows how that looked. There is a time to live and a time to sleep. You are an echo, River. Like Clara. Like all of us, in the end. My fault, I know, but you should've faded by now.
RIVER: It's hard to leave when you haven't said goodbye.
DOCTOR: Then tell me, because I don't know. How do I say it?
RIVER: There's only one way I'd accept. If you ever loved me, say it like you're going to come back.
DOCTOR: Well, then. See you around, Professor River Song.
RIVER: Till the next time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Don't wait up.
RIVER: Oh, there's one more thing.
DOCTOR: Isn't there always?
RIVER: I was mentally linked with Clara. If she's really dead, then how can I still be here?
DOCTOR: Okay, how?
RIVER: Spoilers. Goodbye, sweetie.
CLARA : I don't know where I am. I don't know where I'm going or where I've been. I was born to save the Doctor, but the Doctor is safe now. I'm the Impossible Girl, and my story is done.
CLARA: Doctor?
CLARA: Doctor! Please, please, I don't know where I am.
DOCTOR : Clara. You can hear me. I know you can.
CLARA: I can't see you.
DOCTOR : I'm everywhere. You're inside my time stream. Everything around you is me.
CLARA: I can see you.
CLARA: All your different faces, they're here.
DOCTOR : Those are my ghosts. My past. Every good day, every bad day.
CLARA: What's wrong? What's happening?
DOCTOR : I'm inside my own time stream. It's collapsing in on itself.
CLARA: Well, get out then.
DOCTOR : Not until I've got you.
CLARA: I don't even know who I am.
DOCTOR : You're my Impossible Girl. I'm sending you something. Not from my past, from yours. Look up. Look.
DOCTOR : This is you, Clara. Everything you were or will be. Take it. You blew into the world on this leaf. Hold tight. It will take you home.
DOCTOR : Clara! Clara! Come on. Come on, to me, now.
DOCTOR: You can do it. I know you can.
CLARA: How?
DOCTOR: Because it's impossible. And you're my Impossible Girl. How many times have you saved me, Clara? Just this once, just for the hell of it, let me save you. You have to trust me, Clara. I'm real. Just one more step.
DOCTOR: Clara, my Clara.
CLARA: Who's that?
DOCTOR: Never mind. Let's go back.
CLARA: But who is he?
DOCTOR: He's me. There's only me here, that's the point. Now let's get back.
CLARA: But I never saw that one. I saw all of you. Eleven faces, all of them you. You're the eleventh Doctor.
DOCTOR: I said he was me. I never said he was the Doctor.
CLARA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Look, my name, my real name, that is not the point. The name I chose is the Doctor. The name you choose, it's like, it's like a promise you make. He's the one who broke the promise.
DOCTOR: Clara? Clara? Clara!
DOCTOR: He is my secret.
NOT DOCTOR: What I did, I did without choice.
DOCTOR: I know.
NOT DOCTOR: In the name of peace and sanity.
DOCTOR: But not in the name of the Doctor.
