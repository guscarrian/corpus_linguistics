The Waters of Mars
EMILY : Hello, Mum. Susie says hello, don't you, sweetheart? That's it. Give a little wave. Er, oh, what was I going to say? Uncle Soon called in, he says hello. He keeps saying, you must be missing her. I said, she's been gone for over two years now, I'm getting used to it.
EMILY : Oh, no, it's breaking up. It must be the solar flares.
ADELAIDE: Talk faster.
EMILY : About the deposit on the house. Oh, er, I've spoken to the bank
DOCTOR: The red planet.
ED : Sun sets in ten minutes, Yuri. You're going to lose the light.
MIA: That's it. Got you on External Ten.
YURI : Almost there. That's the radial clamp down. One more thing.
ED: Get back inside, you're using power and oxygen.
YURI: Oh, hold on. Get this on camera. What do you think?
MIA: Hey, looks good. Nice one, Yuri.
ED: You wasted an entire solar panel just to make that.
YURI : Oh, lighten up. It's a joke.
ED: We come all this way to an empty planet, untouched by civilisation, and what do we do? Put up cheap jokes. That's not funny, that's pollution.
ADELAIDE: Having fun? 
ED: I was just telling him.
ADELAIDE: I expect better of you, Ed. Now get back to work, all of you.
DOCTOR: Oh, beautiful.
GADGET: Rotate slowly.
GADGET: You are under arrest for trespassing. Gadget gadget.
ADELAIDE: State your name, rank, and intention.
DOCTOR: The Doctor. Doctor. Fun.
TARAK: What the hell? It's a man. A man on Mars. How?
STEFFI: He was wearing this thing. I have never seen anything like it.
TARAK: What did Mission Control say?
STEFFI: They're out of range for ten hours with the solar flares.
ADELAIDE: If we could cut the chat, everyone.
DOCTOR: Actually, chat's second on my list, the first being gun pointed at my head. Which then puts my head second and chat third, I think. Gun, head, chat, yeah. I hate lists. But you could hurt someone with that thing. Just put it down.
ADELAIDE: Oh, you'd like that.
DOCTOR: Can you find me someone who wouldn't?
ADELAIDE: Why should I trust you?
DOCTOR: Because I give you my word. And forty million miles away from home, my word is all you've got.
ADELAIDE: Keep Gadget covering him.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Oh right, so you control that thing. Auto-glove response.
ROMAN: You got it. To the right.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
ROMAN: And to the left.
DOCTOR: It's a bit flimsy.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Does it have to keep saying that?
ROMAN: I think it's funny.
DOCTOR: I hate funny robots.
MAGGIE : Excuse me, boss. Computer log says we've got an
MAGGIE: Extra person on site. How's that possible?
ADELAIDE : Keep the Biodome closed.
ADELAIDE: And when using open comms, you call me Captain.
MAGGIE : Yeah, but
MAGGIE: Who is it? Disconnected. She's cut me off. Can you believe her? It's like we're just gardeners.
ANDY: As long as they leave us alone, that's fine with me. Oh, you beauties. Look at this.
MAGGIE: Better start planting some more if there's an extra mouth to feed.
ANDY: The very first garden off Earth. Everything brand new. Eden. That's what we should've called this place.
MAGGIE: It's the Philippines. I bet. If there's someone else on Mars, it's got to be the Philippines. All those stories about them building a rocket. Adelaide's going to love that. Stealing her thunder. Mind you, worth it to see her face.
 
MAGGIE: Or it could be the Spanish. They kept that Spacelink project under wraps. Didn't your sister work for them? Are you all right, mate? Come on, stop mucking about. Andy? Are you okay?
ED: He can't be a World State flight, because we'd know about it. Therefore, he's got to be one of the independents, yeah? Was it the Branson inheritance lot? They've talked about a Mars shot for years.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, okay, you got me. So, I'm the Doctor, and you are?
ADELAIDE: Oh, come on. We're the first off-world colonists in history. Everyone on planet Earth knows who we are.
DOCTOR: You're the first? The very first humans on Mars? Then this is
BOTH: Bowie Base One.
DOCTOR: Number one. Founded July 1st, 2058. Established Bowie Base One in the Gusev Crater. You've been here how long?
ADELAIDE: Seventeen months.
DOCTOR: 2059. It's 2059, right now. Oh! My head is so stupid. You're Captain Adelaide Brooke. And Ed. You're Deputy Edward Gold. Tarak Ital, MD. Nurse Yuri Kerenski. Senior Technician Steffi Ehrlich. Junior Technician Roman Groom. Geologist Mia Bennett. You're only twenty seven years old.
ADELAIDE: As I said, Doctor, everyone knows our names.
DOCTOR: Oh, they'll never forget them. What's the date, today? What is it? Tell me the exact date.
ADELAIDE: November 21st, 2059.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, fine.
STEFFI: Is there something wrong?
MIA: What's so important about my age?
DOCTOR: I should go. I really should go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry with all of my hearts, but it's one of those very rare times when I've got no choice. It's been an honour. Seriously, a very great honour to meet you all. The Martian pioneers.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Ah.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Thank you. There's the other two. Hold on. Margaret Cain and Andrew Stone.
ED: Maggie, if you want to meet the only new human being that you're going to see in the next five years, better come take a look.
MIA: What was that?
DOCTOR: Oh, I really should go.
ED: This is Central. Biodome report immediately.
ADELAIDE: Show me the Biodome.
ED: Internal cameras are down.
ADELAIDE: Show me the exterior.
ADELAIDE: I'm going over. Doctor, with me.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm sorry. Er, I'd love to help, but I'm leaving right now.
ADELAIDE: Take his spacesuit, lock it up. This started as soon as you arrived, so you're not going anywhere except with me.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
ADELAIDE: What's so important about Mia's age? You said she's only twenty seven. Why does it matter? What did you mean?
DOCTOR: Oh, I just open my mouth and words come out. They don't make much sense.
TARAK: Telling me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Doctor.
TARAK: Any time, Doctor.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR : I hate robots. Did I say?
ROMAN: Yeah, and he's not too fond of you. What's wrong with robots?
DOCTOR: It's not the robots, it's the people. Dressing them up and giving them silly voices. Like you're reducing them.
ROMAN : Yeah. Friend of mine
ROMAN: She made her domestic robot look like a dog.
DOCTOR: Ah well, dogs. That's different.
ROMAN : But I adapted Gadget out of the
ROMAN: Worker drones. Those things are huge. They built this place when the shell was lowered down from orbit. They've got a strength capacity of fifteen tons.
ADELAIDE : The channel is open for essential
ADELAIDE: Communications only.
ROMAN: Sorry. Love those drones.
DOCTOR: I've read all that stuff about you, Captain Adelaide. But one thing they never said. Was it worth it, the mission?
ADELAIDE: We've got excellent results from the soil analysis.
DOCTOR: No, but all of it. Because they say you sacrificed everything. Devoted your whole life to get here.
ADELAIDE: It's been chaos back home. Forty long years. The climate, the ozone, the oil apocalypse. We almost reached extinction. Then to fly above that, to stand on a world with no smoke, where the only straight line is the sunlight? Yes. It's worth it.
DOCTOR: Ah. That's the Adelaide Brooke I always wanted to meet. The woman with starlight in her soul.
ADELAIDE: What's that?
ADELAIDE: It's Maggie.
DOCTOR: Don't touch her!
TARAK: I know the procedure. Maggie, can you hear me? It's Tarak. Maggie? It's okay, she's still breathing. She's alive. Yuri, I've got Margaret Cain, head trauma. I need a full medpack.
YURI: I've got it. Medpack on its way.
ED: I'm going to help!
STEFFI: In the absence of the Captain, you're in charge, sir! You've got to stay in the Dome.
DOCTOR: Don't touch her. Use the gloves.
TARAK: Do what he says. Get her to Sickbay. Put her in isolation.
ADELAIDE: We're going on to the Biodome. Tarak, with me. Yuri can take care of her. Ed, go back. Gadget, stand guard. Keep an eye on this area.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
ED: Captain, you're going to need me. Andy is the only other crew member out here, and if that wasn't an accident, then he's gone wild.
ADELAIDE: You've deserted your post. Consider that an official warning. Now get back to work. Doctor.
STEFFI: Captain, that sound we heard from the Biodome. I've run it through diagnostics. According to the computer, it's, it's Andy.
STEFFI : It registers as the voice print of Andy Stone.
ADELAIDE: Understood. Double check, thanks.
TARAK: Air pressure stabilised.
ADELAIDE: Andrew? Andrew Stone? It's Captain Brooke. Andy, report. I need to see you. Where are you?
DOCTOR: There you go.
ADELAIDE: What's that device?
DOCTOR: Screwdriver.
ADELAIDE: Are you the Doctor or the janitor?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Sounds like me. The maintenance man of the universe.
ADELAIDE: You stay with me. Don't step out of my sight. Tarak, go to External Door South. Make sure it's intact.
TARAK: Yes, ma'am.
DOCTOR: Quite an achievement. First flower on Mars in ten thousand years. And you're growing veg!
ADELAIDE: It's that lot. They're already planning Christmas dinner. Last year it was dehydrated protein, this year they want the real thing.
DOCTOR: Still, fair enough. Christmas.
ADELAIDE: If we must.
DOCTOR: You've got birds!
ADELAIDE: It's part of the project, to keep the insect population down.
DOCTOR: Good sign.
ADELAIDE: In what way?
DOCTOR: Well, they're still alive.
YURI : Captain, good news.
YURI: It's Maggie. She's awake. She's back with us. Hey. How are you, soldier? Just take it easy. Can you remember what happened?
MAGGIE: I was just working. Then I woke up here.
ADELAIDE: What about Andy? We can't find him.
ADELAIDE : Was he all right?
MAGGIE: I don't know. I just
ADELAIDE : If you remember anything, let me know straight away.
ED: Yuri, does she know how she ended up in the tunnel?
ADELAIDE: And keep the comms clear.
ADELAIDE : Everything goes through me, got that?
MAGGIE: Come on. Just let me out of here. I'm fine. Just groggy.
YURI: You know the rules. Twenty four hours.
TARAK: Andy? Andy! Andy! There you are. Are you all right?
TARAK: Andy. Andrew. Look at me.
MAGGIE: Is that your brother?
YURI: It's only a repeat. The solar flares are still up. Are you okay?
MAGGIE: Yeah. Just, you know.
YURI: He makes me laugh, though. It's his husband. He spends money like an idiot! Last year, for Mikhail's birthday, he said don't buy me anything.
YURI: Let's save money. Georg says fine, okay. His birthday comes around, turns out Georg has bought him a car. Top of the range. And the thing is, he's used Mikhail's credit stamp. So Mik's saying, that means I bought it myself. Georg says it's the thought that counts.
MAGGIE: Where does he live?
YURI: Oh, just outside Dagestan.
MAGGIE: Where's that?
YURI On the Caspian Sea. Here you go.
MAGGIE: By the sea.
YURI: Well, technically it's more of a lake.
MAGGIE: Earth is so much water.
YURI: Yeah. Just look at her. Forty million miles away.
MAGGIE: It has so much beauty.
MAGGIE: We should like that world.
YURI: This is Sickbay. We have a situation. Maggie's condition has. I don't know. I don't know what it is. It's water, just pouring out.
ADELAIDE : Yuri, calm down.
ADELAIDE: Just tell me what's happened to her.
YURI : The skin is
YURI: Sort of broken around the mouth. And she's exuding
YURI : Water, like she's drowning.
ADELAIDE: Tarak, this area's unsafe. We're going back. Tarak? Tarak!
DOCTOR: Where was he?
ED: Yuri, keep her contained. Seal the door at maximum. I'm on my way!
DOCTOR: Andy, just leave him alone.
ADELAIDE: Step away from him.
DOCTOR: I can help, I promise. I can help. Just leave that man alone.
ADELAIDE: I order you to stop. Stop, or I'll shoot.
DOCTOR: Andy, I'm asking you to take your hand away from him and listen to me.
DOCTOR: There now, that's better, hmm? So, you must be Andy. Hello.
DOCTOR: We've got to go.
DOCTOR: Set the seals on maximum!
ED: What the hell?
MIA: That's not Maggie. What's happened to her? Yuri, what is she?
STEFFI: Captain, we need you back here.
ADELAIDE : Just tell me that Maggie is contained.
ADELAIDE: Can you confirm, Ed?
ED: Confirmed. She's locked in.
ADELAIDE : Keep surveillance till I get back.
ADELAIDE: And close down all water supplies. All pipes and outlets. Don't consume anything.
ADELAIDE: Have you got that, everyone? That's an order. Don't drink the water.
ADELAIDE: Don't even touch it. Not one drop.
DOCTOR: Can you talk? Human beings are sixty percent water, which makes them the perfect host.
ADELAIDE: What for?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I never will. Because I've got to go. Whatever's started here, I can't see it to the end. I can't.
DOCTOR: This thing's airtight, yeah?
ADELAIDE: And therefore watertight.
DOCTOR: It depends how clever the water is.
ADELAIDE: They're fusing the system.
DOCTOR: Abandon ship!
ADELAIDE: Doctor, we haven't got time.
DOCTOR: They can run faster than us. We need a lift.
ROMAN: Hey!
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Get on behind me.
ADELAIDE: That thing goes at two miles an hour.
DOCTOR: Not any more. Trust me.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Gadget gadget.
ADELAIDE: The Central Dome airlocks have got Hardinger seals. There's no way they can get in.
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on.
ADELAIDE: I thought you hated robots.
DOCTOR: I do.
ADELAIDE: We're safe. It's hermetically sealed. They can't get in.
DOCTOR: Water is patient, Adelaide. Water just waits. It wears down the clifftops, the mountains, the whole of the world. Water always wins. Come on.
ADELAIDE: Biodome Tunnel is out of bounds. Andy and Tarak are infected.
ADELAIDE: Repeat, infected. Make no contact. And if they make the slightest move, tell me.
ADELAIDE : I'm going to the Medical Dome.
DOCTOR: Blimey, it's a distance. You could do with bikes in this place.
ADELAIDE: Every pound in weight equals three tons of fuel.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I know. But bikes.
ADELAIDE: Has that door got a Hardinger seal?
ED: No, just basic.
ADELAIDE: Then the moment she heads for the door, we evacuate. Got that?
ED: Pulse is low. Electrical activity in the brain seems to be going haywire.
ADELAIDE: Can she talk?
YURI: Don't know. She was talking before we noticed the change, but
ADELAIDE: Maggie, can you hear me? Do you know who I am? Your commanding officer, Captain Adelaide Brooke. Can you tell me what happened?
DOCTOR: Hoorghwall in schtochman ahn warrellinsh och fortabellan iin hoorgwahn.
ED: What language is that?
DOCTOR: Ancient North Martian.
ADELAIDE: Don't be ridiculous.
ED: It's like she recognised it.
DOCTOR: And her eyes are different. They're clear, like she's closer to human.
ED: Not close enough for me.
DOCTOR: Where do you get your water from?
ADELAIDE: The ice field. That's why we chose the crater. We're on top of an underground glacier.
DOCTOR: Tons of water. Marvellous.
YURI: But every single drop is filtered. It's screened. It's safe.
DOCTOR: Looks like it, yeah. 
ED: If something was frozen down there. A viral life form held in the ice for all those years.
DOCTOR: Look at her mouth. All blackened, like there's some sort of fission. This thing, whatever it is, doesn't just hide in water, it creates water. Tell me what you want.
YURI: She was looking at the screen. At Earth. She wanted Earth. A world full of water.
ED: Captain, With me.
ED: I'm sorry, but it's an unknown infection and it's spreading. That demands Action Procedure One.
ADELAIDE: Do you think I don't know that?
ED: I think you need reminding.
ADELAIDE: Yeah.
ED: Well, at least I'm good for something.
ADELAIDE: Now and again.
ED: That's almost a compliment. Things must be serious.
DOCTOR: Sorry, sorry, but, Action One, that means evacuation, yeah?
ADELAIDE: We're going home. This is Captain Brooke. I'm declaring Action One. Repeat to all crewmembers, this is Action One with immediate effect. Evacuate the base.
STEFFI: I'll store the central computer. Mia, strip the cargo down to essentials. Roman, on your feet.
ROMAN: But we came all this way.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
STEFFI: And you can kiss that robot goodbye. It's too heavy. Now shove it in storage and hurry up.
ADELAIDE : Steffi, what's your estimate on shuttle viability?
STEFFI: It's a nine month flight. It'll take us at least three hours to load up everything we need.
ADELAIDE : You've got twenty minutes. And give me a report on Andy and Tarak.
STEFFI: Still in the Biodome tunnel. They're just standing there, like they're waiting.
ADELAIDE : Keep an eye on them.
ADELAIDE: And make that twenty minutes fifteen. Ed, line up the shuttle. Go straight to ignition status.
ED: Doing it now.
YURI: But what about Maggie?
ADELAIDE: She stays behind. We've got no way to contain her on board. Close this place down. I want the power directed to the shuttle.
DOCTOR: Of course, the only problem is
ADELAIDE: Thank you, Doctor. Your spacesuit will be returned. And good luck to you.
DOCTOR: The problem is, this thing is clever. It didn't infect the birds or the insects in the biodome, it chose the humans. You were chosen. And I told you, Adelaide, water can wait. Tarak changed straight away, but when Maggie was infected it stayed hidden inside her, no doubt so it could infiltrate the Central Dome. Which means
ADELAIDE: Any one of us could already be infected. We've all been drinking the same water.
DOCTOR: And if you take that back to Earth, one drop. Just one drop.
ADELAIDE: But we're only presuming infection. If we can find out how this thing got through. When it got through. Yuri, continue with Action One. I'm going to inspect the ice field.
DOCTOR: Right. I should leave. Finally, I should leave. Yuri, me old mate, no point in me seeing the ice field. No point at all. No. Adelaide!
DOCTOR: All I'm saying is, bikes. Little foldaway bikes. Don't weigh a thing.
YURI: I'm sorry.
ROMAN: Even if she gets past the Medical Dome, she'll never get past the Hardinger seal at this end, right?
ED: So we keep saying. Camera's down. We've lost her.
DOCTOR: They tell legends of Mars from long ago, of a fine and noble race who built an empire out of snow. The Ice Warriors.
ADELAIDE: I haven't got time for stories.
DOCTOR: Perhaps they found something down there. Used their might and their wisdom to freeze it.
ADELAIDE: Doctor, we need to find any sort of change in the water process. We've got to date the infection.
COMPUTER: Access denied.
ADELAIDE: You don't look like a coward, but all you've wanted to do is leave. You know so much about us.
DOCTOR: Well, you're famous.
ADELAIDE: It's like you know more.
DOCTOR: This moment, this precise moment in time, it's like. I mean, it's only a theory, what do I know, but I think certain moments in time are fixed. Tiny, precious moments. Everything else is in flux, anything can happen, but those certain moments, they have to stand. This base on Mars with you, Adelaide Brooke, this is one vital moment. What happens here must always happen.
ADELAIDE: Which is what?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I think something wonderful happens. Something that started fifty years ago, isn't that right?
ADELAIDE: I've never told anyone that.
DOCTOR: You told your daughter. And maybe one day she tells the story to her daughter. The day the Earth was stolen and moved across the universe. And you
ADELAIDE: I saw the Daleks. We looked up. The sky had changed. Everyone was running and screaming. And my father took hold of me.
BROOKE: Stay here. Don't move. I've got to go out. I'm going to find your mother, but I'm coming back. I promise you. I'm coming back.
ADELAIDE : I never saw him again.
ADELAIDE: Nor my mother. They were never found. But out on the streets, there was panic and burning. I went to the window, and there, in the sky, I saw it, Doctor. And it saw me. It stared at me. It looked right into me. And then it simply went away. I knew, that night, I knew I would follow it.
DOCTOR: But not for revenge.
ADELAIDE: What would be the point of that?
DOCTOR: That's what makes you remarkable. And that's how you create history.
ADELAIDE: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Imagine it, Adelaide, if you began a journey that takes the human race all the way out to the stars. It begins with you, and then your granddaughter, you inspire her, so that in thirty years Susie Fontana Brooke is the pilot of the first lightspeed ship to Proxima Centauri. And then everywhere, with her children, and her children's children forging the way. To the Dragon Star, the Celestial Belt of the Winter Queen, the Map of the Watersnake Wormholes. One day a Brooke will even fall in love with a Tandonian prince, that's the start of a whole new species. But everything starts with you, Adelaide. From fifty years ago to right here, today. Imagine.
ADELAIDE: Who are you? Why are you telling me this? Doctor, why tell me?
DOCTOR: As consolation.
ADELAIDE: Andy Stone. He logged on yesterday.
ANDY : Maintenance log, twenty one twenty, November 2059. Number three water filter's bust. And guess what? The spares they sent don't fit. What a surprise. Over and out.
DOCTOR: A filter! One tiny little filter and then the Flood.
ADELAIDE: But that means the infection arrived today, and the water's only cycled out of the biodome after a week. The rest of us can't be infected. We can leave. Ed, we're clean.
ADELAIDE : How are we doing?
ED: Shuttle's active. Stage one. I haven't got time to convey the protein packs. If you want food you're going to have to carry it by hand. Start loading, right now.
ADELAIDE: You were right, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What about?
ADELAIDE: Bikes!
ADELAIDE: Now get to your ship. I'm saving my people, you save yourself. I know what this moment is. It's the moment we escape. Now get out.
ED: Everyone, stay focused.
MIA: I'll swap them round. Roman, what about you?
ROMAN: Protein packs thirty to thirty six.
ED: Hurry up, Roman.
ADELAIDE: Ditch the central containers. We don't need them.
STEFFI: Units forty one, forty two and forty three.
YURI: Unit forty one is here.
ADELAIDE: Roman, try to condense the oxygen membranes. We can lose ten pounds. Faster, come on! Ed, how's the fuel jets?
ED: Cooling down in about thirty seconds.
STEFFI: Captain, we've got all the hard drives.
ADELAIDE: What the hell's that noise? Mia, you lot, shut up.
ED: It's the module sensors. Exterior twelve. The cameras are down, but there's pressure on top of the module. Two signals right above us.
STEFFI: That means they're on the roof?
YURI: How did they get inside the Dome?
ED: They used the maintenance shafts.
MIA: The shaft's open and they haven't got spacesuits.
ED: They breathe water.
STEFFI: But they'd freeze.
YURI: They've got that internal fission.
MIA: But we're safe, they can't get through, can they? Can they?
ROMAN: This place is airtight.
STEFFI: Can it get through? Ed, can it get through?
ED: I don't know! Water itself isn't motile, but it has some sort of persistence.
ADELAIDE: Everyone, listen to me. That's ten feet of steel-combination up there. We need all the protein packs or we're going to starve. Now keep working. Roman, watch the ceiling. Ed, get to the shuttle. Fire it up.
ED: I can carry more than this lot, Captain.
ADELAIDE: That's an order!
ED: Captain.
COMPUTER: Access denied. Access denied.
ADELAIDE : Tell me what happens.
DOCTOR: I don't know.
ADELAIDE : Yes, you do.
ADELAIDE: Now tell me.
DOCTOR : You should be with the others.
ADELAIDE: Tell me! I could ramp up the pressure in that airlock and crush you.
DOCTOR : Except you won't. You could have shot Andy Stone, but you didn't.
DOCTOR: I loved you for that. Imagine, imagine you knew something. Imagine you found yourself somewhere. I don't know, Pompeii.
DOCTOR : Imagine you were in Pompeii.
ADELAIDE: What the hell's that got to do with it?
DOCTOR : And you tried to save them.
DOCTOR: But in doing so, you make it happen. Anything I do just makes it happen.
STEFFI: Captain, we need you right now.
ADELAIDE : I'm still here.
DOCTOR : You're taking Action One. There are four more standard action procedures. And Action Five is?
ADELAIDE: Detonation.
DOCTOR : The final option. The nuclear device at the heart of the Central Dome. Today, on the twenty first of November 2059, Captain Brooke activates that device, taking the base and all her crew members with her. No one ever knows why. But you were saving Earth. That's what inspires your granddaughter. She takes your people out into the galaxy because you die on Mars. You die today. She flies out there like she's trying to meet you.
ADELAIDE: I won't die. I will not.
DOCTOR : But your death creates the future.
ADELAIDE: Help me. Why won't you help, Doctor? If you know all of this, why can't you change it?
DOCTOR : I can't.
ADELAIDE: Why can't you find a way? You could tell me, I don't know
DOCTOR : I'm sorry, but I can't. Sometimes I can, sometimes I do. Most times I can save someone, or anyone. But not you. You wondered all your life why that Dalek spared you. I think it knew. Your death is fixed in time for ever. And that's right.
ADELAIDE: You'll die here too.
DOCTOR : No.
ADELAIDE: What's going to save you?
DOCTOR : Captain Adelaide Brooke.
ADELAIDE: Damn you.
ROMAN: Water! We've got water!
MIA: Captain! Get back! Get back! Captain! Don't touch it, Roman. Get back. Get back.
ADELAIDE: Everyone, we're abandoning this section. Get to the shuttle. Yuri, lead the way. Section B corridor, now.
MIA: Get that, and that.
ADELAIDE: Close it!
MIA: Yuri, did that water touch you?
YURI: I'm safe
STEFFI: Did it touch you?
STEFFI : Yuri, did that water touch you?
YURI : I'm clean. I'm dry.
ADELAIDE : Everyone
ADELAIDE: Section B is out.
MIA: But we can get
ADELAIDE: Listen to me.
ADELAIDE : Take every pack that you can. We'll go round. We'll make our way out through Section F.
STEFFI : Transferring oxygenation to Section F. Mia you take the redline stock. And hurry up!
YURI: Steffi, come!
MIA : Steffi, get back!
ADELAIDE : Steffi, keep back.
YURI : Get back!
MIA : Steffi!
YURI : Get back, Steffi!
ADELAIDE: Screen!
YURI: Shut the door! Close the door!
ROMAN: Steffi, we'll come get you, okay? We'll come get you!
ADELAIDE: Steffi!
STEFFI: Captain!
ADELAIDE: We'll open the access panel.
ADELAIDE : We'll get you out through the back.
ADELAIDE: Get out of here. Move it!
STEFFI: Captain, it's inside!
ADELAIDE : Steffi!
MIA : Steffi, get back!
ADELAIDE : We're coming, Steffi. Hold on!
ROMAN : The access panel's fused, Captain. We can't open it.
YURI : We can't get through!
STEFFI : I can't move!
ULRIKA : Hallo, Mutti. Hallo, Mars! Sag hallo. 
ADELAIDE: Steffi! Can you hear me?
MIA: Oh, my God.
ADELAIDE: Out. Get out.
ADELAIDE: Ed, we're going round the long way. How are we doing?
ED: All systems online one hundred percent. Not a single delay. Don't you worry, Captain, we are going to fly.
ADELAIDE : I need air in section F right now. All of you
YURI : Locking chamber three. Locking chamber four.
ROMAN : The water is going to get through.
ADELAIDE : Keep moving!
YURI : Gate five is open. Gate six is open.
YURI [OC} Quickly, come on.
MIA: I've got twenty five to thirty locked down.
ADELAIDE: Roman, come on. With me.
ROMAN: You'd better go.
ADELAIDE: Don't just stand there. Move.
ROMAN : You'd really better go without me.
ROMAN: I'm sorry, Captain. One drop.
MIA: Roman! Roman!
YURI: Leave him, come on.
MIA : We can't just leave him.
YURI : Come on.
MIA : Let me go!
YURI : We've got to go.
MIA : Roman!
YURI: I'm so sorry.
ED : Captain. The shuttle is down.
ADELAIDE: What the hell do you mean?
ED : Compromised. It was Maggie.
ADELAIDE: Get out of there.
ED : Too late.
ED: They want this ship to get to Earth. Got no choice.
ED: Hated it, Adelaide.
ED: This bloody job. Argh.
ED : You never gave me a chance.
ED : You never could forgive me.
ED: See you later.
YURI: We're losing oxygen!
YURI : The hull is broken!
DOCTOR : I'm not just a Time Lord, I'm the Last of the Time Lords. They'll never come back. Not now. I've got a Tardis. Same old life, last of the Time Lords. And they died and took it all with them. The walls of reality closed, the worlds were sealed, gone for ever. The Time Lords kept their eye on everything. It's gone now. But they died, the Time Lords! All of them, they died. I'm the last of the Time Lords.
DOCTOR: Mia, take this sealant, fix that leak. Yuri, open emergency oxygen. Adelaide, don't just sit there. That's better. The Dome's still got integrity! It's ten feet of steel-combination, made in Liverpool. Magnificent workmanship.
ADELAIDE: It can't be stopped. Don't die with us.
DOCTOR: No, because someone told me just recently. They said I was going to die. They said he will knock four times, and I think I know what that means, and it doesn't mean right here, right now, because I don't hear anyone knocking, do you?
DOCTOR: Three knocks is all you're getting.
DOCTOR: Water and electricity, bad mix. Now then, what else have we got?
ADELAIDE: But there's no way to fight them.
DOCTOR: Heat! They use water, so we can use heat. Works against the Ice Warriors, works against the Flood. Ramp up the environment controls and steam them.
ADELAIDE: But you said we die. For the future, for the human race.
DOCTOR: Yes, because there are laws. There are Laws of Time. Once upon a time there were people in charge of those laws, but they died. They all died. Do you know who that leaves? Me! It's taken me all these years to realise the Laws of Time are mine, and they will obey me!
ADELAIDE: Environment controls are down. Sorry, Doctor, it looks like history's got other ideas.
DOCTOR: I'm not beaten yet. I'll go outside, find the heat regulator.
DOCTOR: Not beaten. Not beaten! You've got spacesuits in the next section.
DOCTOR: We're not just fighting the Flood, we're fighting time itself. And I'm going to win!
YURI: Something is happening to the glacier.
DOCTOR: Think-a think-a think-a think. What have we got? Not enough oxygen. Protein packs, useless. Glacier, glacier mints, minty, Monty, molto bene, bunny, bonny, bish bash bosh. Argh. The room, the room, look at the room. Section F. What's in Section F? Anyone!
YURI: Nothing. It's just storage.
DOCTOR: Storing what?
YURI: I don't know. Er, the weather spikes, the robots, the atom clamps.
DOCTOR: Atom clamps. Atom clamps? Who needs atom clamps? I love a funny robot.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: You take that. Good boy.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Off we go then.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on!
COMPUTER: Implementing Captain's protocol.
DOCTOR: Adelaide? What are you doing?
MIA: Oh, my God. Action Five.
DOCTOR: If I have to fight you as well, then I will.
COMPUTER: Nuclear device now active and primed.
COMPUTER: Nuclear device now active and primed.
DOCTOR: Blast off!
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Faster!
COMPUTER: Nuclear device entering final process.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: And we're in! Ha, ha.
GADGET: Gadget gadget.
DOCTOR: Isn't anyone going to thank me?
DOCTOR: He's lost his signal. Doesn't know where he is.
ADELAIDE: That's my house.
DOCTOR: Don't you get it? This is the twenty first of November 2059. It's the same day on Earth. And it's snowing. I love snow.
MIA: What is that thing? It's bigger. I mean, it's bigger on the inside. Who the hell are you?
ADELAIDE: Look after her.
YURI: Yes, ma'am.
ADELAIDE: You saved us.
DOCTOR: Just think though. Your daughter, and your daughter's daughter, you can see them again. Family reunion.
ADELAIDE: But I'm supposed to be dead.
DOCTOR: Not any more.
ADELAIDE: But Susie, my granddaughter. The person she's supposed to become might never exist now.
DOCTOR: Nah! Captain Adelaide can inspire her face to face. Different details, but the story's the same.
ADELAIDE: You can't know that. And if my family changes, the whole of history could change. The future of the human race. No-one should have that much power.
DOCTOR: Tough.
ADELAIDE: You should have left us there.
DOCTOR: Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before. In small ways, saved some little people, but never someone as important as you. Oh, I'm good.
ADELAIDE: Little people? What, like Mia and Yuri? Who decides they're so unimportant? You?
DOCTOR: For a long time now, I thought I was just a survivor, but I'm not. I'm the winner. That's who I am. The Time Lord Victorious.
ADELAIDE: And there's no one to stop you.
DOCTOR: No.
ADELAIDE: This is wrong, Doctor. I don't care who you are. The Time Lord Victorious is wrong.
DOCTOR: That's for me to decide. Now, you'd better get home. Oh, it's all locked up. You've been away. Still, that's easy.
DOCTOR: All yours.
ADELAIDE: Is there nothing you can't do?
DOCTOR: Not any more.
ADELAIDE : I don't care who you are. The Time Lord Victorious is wrong.
DOCTOR: I've gone too far. Is this it? My death? Is it time?
DOCTOR: No.
