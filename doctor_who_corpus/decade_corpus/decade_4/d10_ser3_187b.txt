The Sound of Drums
MARTHA: Oh, my head.
DOCTOR: Time travel without a capsule. That's a killer.
JACK: Still, at least we made it. Earth, twenty first century by the looks of it. Talk about lucky.
DOCTOR: That wasn't luck, that was me.
DOCTOR: Hold still! Don't move! Hold it still!
JACK: I'm telling you, it's broken. It hasn't worked for years.
DOCTOR: That's because you didn't have me. Martha, grab hold, now!
JACK: The moral is, if you're going to get stuck at the end of the universe, get stuck with an ex-Time Agent and his vortex manipulator.
MARTHA: But this Master bloke, he's got the Tardis. He could be anywhere in time and space.
DOCTOR: No, he's here. Trust me.
MARTHA: Who is he, anyway? And that voice at the end, that wasn't the Professor.
JACK: If the Master's a Time Lord, then he must have regenerated.
MARTHA: What does that mean?
JACK: It means he's changed his face, voice, body, everything. New man.
MARTHA: Then how are we going to find him?
DOCTOR: I'll know him, the moment I see him. Time Lords always do.
MARTHA: But hold on. If he could be anyone, we missed the election. But it can't be.
NEWSREADER : Mister Saxon has returned from the Palace and is greeting the crowd inside Saxon Headquarters.
MARTHA: I said I knew that voice. When he spoke inside the Tardis. I've heard that voice hundreds of times. I've seen him. We all have. That was the voice of Harold Saxon.
DOCTOR: That's him. He's Prime Minister.
PHOTOGRAPHER : Mister Saxon, this way, sir. Come on, kiss for the lady, sir.
DOCTOR: The Master is Prime Minister of Great Britain. The Master and his wife?
MASTER: This country has been sick. This country needs healing. This country needs medicine.
MASTER : In fact, I'd go so far as to say that what this country really needs right now, is a Doctor.
WOMAN: Finance report, sir.
WOMAN 2: Military protocol, sir.
WOMAN 3: EC directive, sir.
MAN: Annual budget, sir.
MAN 2: Policy recommendations.
LUCY: I'm so proud of you, Harry.
MASTER: Bless.
TISH: Sir. If you don't mind me asking. I'm sorry, but it's all a bit new. What exactly do you want me to do?
MASTER: Oh yes, what was it?
TISH: Tish. Letitia Jones.
MASTER: Tish. Well then, Tish, you just stand there and look gorgeous.
MASTER: A glorious day. Downing Street rebuilt, the Cabinet in session. Let the work of government begin.
MASTER: Oh, go on. Crack a smile. It's funny, isn't it? Albert, funny? No? Little bit?
DUMFRIES: Very funny, sir. But if we could get down to business, there is the matter of policy, of which we have very little.
MASTER: No, no, no, no. Before we start all that, I just want to say thank you. Thank you, one and all. You ugly, fat faced bunch of wet, snivelling traitors.
DUMFRIES: Yes, quite, very funny. But I think
MASTER: No. No, that wasn't funny. You see, I'm not making myself very clear. Funny is like this.
MASTER: Not funny is like this.
MASTER: And right now, I'm not like  I'm like  because you are traitors. Yes, you are! As soon as you saw the vote swinging my way, you abandoned your parties and you jumped on the Saxon bandwagon. So this is your reward.
DUMFRIES: Excuse me, Prime Minister. Do you mind my asking, what is that?
MASTER:  It's a gas mask.
DUMFRIES: I beg your pardon?
MASTER: It's a gas mask.
DUMFRIES: Yes, but, er, why are you wearing it?
MASTER:  Well, because of the gas.
DUMFRIES: I'm sorry?
MASTER: Because of the gas.
DUMFRIES: What gas?
MASTER:  This gas.
DUMFRIES: You're insane!
MARTHA: Home.
DOCTOR: What have you got? Computer, laptop, anything. Jack, who are you phoning? You can't tell anyone we're here.
JACK: Just some friends of mine, but there's no reply.
MARTHA: Here you go. Any good?
JACK: I can show you the Saxon websites. He's been around for ages.
MARTHA: That's so weird though. It's the day after the election. That's only four days after I met you.
DOCTOR: We went flying all around the universe while he was here all the time.
MARTHA: You going to tell us who he is?
DOCTOR: He's a Time Lord.
MARTHA: What about the rest of it? I mean, who'd call himself the Master?
DOCTOR: That's all you need to know. Come on, show me Harold Saxon.
TISH : Martha, where are you? I've got this new job. You won't believe it. It's weird. They just phoned me up out of the blue. I'm working for
MARTHA: Oh, like it matters.
TISH: I'm sorry, but you're not allowed in
VIVIEN: Harold Saxon, A Modern Churchill. It's the definitive think piece on the man himself. Oh, come on, sweetheart. You must've read it.
TISH: Not really. Sorry, I'm new.
VIVIEN: Mister Saxon does like a pretty face, but I'm here to see Mrs Saxon.
TISH: You can't just go barging in.
VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon. Vivien Rook, Sunday Mirror. You've heard of me.
LUCY: Oh, can't I just have an hour to myself? It's been a hell of a day.
VIVIEN: Oh, strike while the iron's hot, that's what I say, Lucy. I can call you Lucy, can't I? Now, everyone's talking about Harold Saxon, but I thought, What about the wife? All I need is twenty minutes.
LUCY: Oh, I think maybe we should wait.
VIVIEN: The headline's waiting to print. The Power Behind the Throne.
LUCY: Really?
VIVIEN: Britain's First Lady.
LUCY: Gosh.
VIVIEN: Front page.
LUCY: Oh. Well, I suppose. Oh, go on then. Twenty minutes.
VIVIEN: Excellent! Thank you. Go, go, what was it? Er, Tish. Now you can leave us alone.
TISH: No, but I'm supposed to sit in?
VIVIEN: No, no, it's only a profile piece. You know, hair and clothes and nonsense. There's a good girl. Out you go. That's it.
VIVIEN: Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe that you're in very great danger. All of us, in fact. Not just the country, but the whole world. No, I beg of you, hear me out.
LUCY: What are you talking about?
VIVIEN: Your husband is not who he says he is. I'm sorry, but it's a lie. Everything's a lie.
SHARON OSBOURNE : I'm voting Saxon. He can tick my box any day.
McFLY : Vote Saxon! Go Harry!
ANN WIDDECOMBE : I think Mister Saxon is exactly what this country needs. He's a very fine man. And he's handsome too.
JACK: Former Minister of Defence. First came to prominence when he shot down the Racnoss on Christmas Eve. Nice work, by the way.
DOCTOR: Oh, thanks.
MARTHA: But he goes back years. He's famous. Everyone knows his story. Look. Cambridge University, Rugby blue. Won the Athletics thing. Wrote a novel, went into business, marriage, everything. He's got a whole life.
VIVIEN: All of it. The school days, his degree, even his mother and father, it's all invented. Look, Harold Saxon never went to Cambridge. There was no Harold Saxon. The thing is, it's obvious. The forgery is screaming out and yet no one can see it. It's as if he's mesmerized the entire world.
LUCY: I think perhaps you should leave now.
VIVIEN: Eighteen months ago, he became real. This is his first, honest to God appearance, just after the downfall of Harriet Jones. And at the exact same time, they launched the Archangel Network.
LUCY: Mrs Rook, now stop it.
VIVIEN: Even now they've said that the Cabinet has gone into seclusion. I mean, what does that mean, seclusion?
LUCY: How should I know?
VIVIEN: But I've got plenty of research on you. Yes, good family, Roedean, not especially bright but essentially harmless. And that's why I'm asking you, Lucy. I am begging you. If you have seen anything, heard anything, even the slightest thing that would give you cause to doubt him?
LUCY: I think
VIVIEN: Yes?
LUCY: There was a time when we first met, I wondered. But he was so good to my father, and he said.
VIVIEN: What? Just tell me, sweetheart.
LUCY: The thing is, I made my choice.
VIVIEN: I'm sorry?
LUCY: For better or for worse. Isn't that right, Harry?
MASTER: My faithful companion.
VIVIEN: Mister Saxon. Prime Minister, I was just having a little joke with poor little Lucy. I didn't mean.
MASTER: Oh, but you're absolutely right. Harold Saxon doesn't exist.
VIVIEN: Then tell me. Who are you?
MASTER: I am the Master and these are my friends.
VIVIEN: I'm sorry?
MASTER: Can't you hear it, Mrs Rook?
VIVIEN: What do you mean?
MASTER: The drumbeat. The drums coming closer and closer.
FEMALE SPHERE: The lady doesn't like us.
MALE SPHERE: Silly lady.
VIVIEN: No.
MALE SPHERE: Dead lady.
LUCY: Oh, but she knew. Harry, she knew everything. You promised. You said Archangel was one hundred percent.
MASTER: Ninety nine, ninety eight?
LUCY: But if she's asking questions, then who else? How much time have we got?
MASTER: Tomorrow morning. I promise. That's when everything ends.
JACK: But he's got the Tardis. Maybe the Master went back in time and has been living here for decades.
DOCTOR: No.
JACK: Why not? Worked for me.
DOCTOR: When he was stealing the Tardis, the only thing I could do was fuse the coordinates. I locked them permanently. He can only travel between the year one hundred trillion and the last place the Tardis landed. Which is right here, right now.
JACK: Yeah, but a little leeway?
DOCTOR: Well, eighteen months, tops. The most he could have been here is eighteen months. So how has he managed all this? The Master was always sort of hypnotic, but this is on a massive scale.
MARTHA: I was going to vote for him.
DOCTOR: Really?
MARTHA: Well, it was before I even met you. And I liked him.
JACK: Me too.
DOCTOR: Why do you say that? What was his policy? What did he stand for?
MARTHA: I don't know. He always sounded good.
MARTHA: Like you could trust him. Just nice. He spoke about. I can't really remember, but it was good. Just the sound of his voice.
DOCTOR: What's that?
MARTHA: What?
DOCTOR: That. That tapping, that rhythm. What are you doing?
MARTHA: I don't know. It's nothing. It's just, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Our lord and master is speaking to his kingdom.
MASTER : Britain, Britain, Britain.
MASTER: What extraordinary times we've had. Just a few years ago, this world was so small. And then they came, out of the unknown, falling from the skies. You've seen it happen.
MASTER : Big Ben destroyed. A spaceship over London. All those ghosts and metal men. The Christmas star that came to kill.
MASTER: Time and time again, and the government told you nothing.
MASTER : Well, not me. Not Harold Saxon. Because my purpose
MASTER: Here today is to tell you this. Citizens of Great Britain, I have been contacted.
MASTER : A message for humanity, from beyond the stars.
FEMALE SPHERE: People of the Earth,
FEMALE SPHERE : We come in peace. We bring great gifts.
FEMALE SPHERE : We bring technology and wisdom and protection. And all we ask in return is your friendship.
MASTER: Ooo, sweet. And this species has identified itself.
MASTER : They are called the Toclafane.
DOCTOR: What?
MASTER : And tomorrow morning, they will appear. Not in secret, but to all of you. Diplomatic relations with a new species
MASTER: Will begin. Tomorrow, we take our place in the universe. Every man, woman and child. Every teacher and chemist and lorry driver and farmer. Oh, I don't know, every medical student?
DOCTOR: Out!
DOCTOR: All right?
JACK: Fine, yeah, fine.
DOCTOR: Martha? What are you doing?
MARTHA: He knows about me. What about my family?
DOCTOR: Don't tell them anything.
MARTHA: I'll do what I like. Mum? Oh my God
MARTHA : You're there.
FRANCINE: Of course I'm here, sweetheart.
FRANCINE : You all right?
MARTHA: I'm fine. I'm fine. Mum
MARTHA : Has there been anyone asking about me?
FRANCINE : Martha, I think perhaps you should come round.
MARTHA: I can't. Not now.
FRANCINE: No, but it's your father. We've been talking and
FRANCINE : We thought we might give it another go.
MARTHA : Don't be so daft. Since when?
FRANCINE: Just come around.
FRANCINE : Come to the house. We can
FRANCINE: Celebrate.
MARTHA : You said you'd
MARTHA: Never get back with him in a million years.
FRANCINE: Ask him yourself.
CLIVE: Martha, it's me.
MARTHA: Dad, what are you doing there?
CLIVE : Like your mother said.
CLIVE: Come round. We can explain everything.
MARTHA: Dad? Just say
MARTHA : Yes or no.
MARTHA: Is there someone else there?
CLIVE: Yes! Just run!
FRANCINE: Clive!
CLIVE: Listen to me! Just run! I don't know who they are!
FRANCINE: We're trying to help her!
FRANCINE : Martha, don't listen to him!
MARTHA: Dad? What's going on? Dad?
FRANCINE: We've got to get Martha away from him!
MARTHA: We've got to help them.
DOCTOR: That's exactly what they want. It's a trap!
MARTHA: I don't care.
CLIVE: Get off! It's your fault! All of you! You voted Saxon! You did this!
DOCTOR: Corner!
DEXTER: Mister Saxon, we have Condition Red on the Jones plan. We're taking them in. All of them.
FRANCINE: But I was helping you!
MARTHA: Come on, Tish. Pick up.
TISH: Martha, I can't talk right now. We just made first contact. Did you see?
TISH : What are you doing?
TISH: Get off! Linda, tell them!
MARTHA: What's happening? Tish! It's your fault. It's all your fault!
FRANCINE: I was helping you! Get off me! Martha, get out of here! Get out!
DEXTER: Target identified.
DOCTOR: Martha, reverse.
DEXTER: Take aim.
DOCTOR: Get out, now!
DEXTER: Fire!
JACK: Move it!
DEXTER: Take them away.
MARTHA: The only place we can go planet Earth. Great!
DOCTOR: Careful! JACK: Martha, listen to me. Do as I say. We've got to ditch this car. Pull over. Right now!
DOCTOR: Martha, come on!
MARTHA: Leo! Oh, thank God. Leo, you got to listen to me. Where are you?
LEO: I'm in Brighton. Yeah, we came down with Boxer. Did you see that Saxon thing on telly?
MARTHA : Leo, just listen to me. Don't go home.
MARTHA: I'm telling you. Don't phone Mum or Dad or Tish.
MARTHA : You've got to hide.
LEO: Shut up.
MARTHA : On my life.
MARTHA: You've got to trust me.
MARTHA : Go to Boxer's. Stay with him. Don't tell anyone. Just hide.
MASTER: Ooo, a nice little game of
MASTER : Hide and seek. I love that. But I'll find you, Martha Jones.
MASTER: Been a long time since we saw each other. Must be, what, one hundred trillion years?
MARTHA: Let them go, Saxon. Do you hear me! Let them go!
DOCTOR: I'm here.
MASTER: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Master.
MASTER: I like it when you use my name.
DOCTOR: You chose it. Psychiatrist's field day.
MASTER: As you chose yours. The man who makes people better. How sanctimonious is that?
DOCTOR: So, Prime Minister, then.
MASTER: I know.
MASTER: It's good, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Who are those creatures? Because there's no such thing as the Toclafane. It's just a made up name, like the Bogeyman.
MASTER : Do you remember
MASTER: All those fairy tales about the Toclafane when we were kids
MASTER : Back home. Where is it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Gone.
MASTER: How can Gallifrey be gone?
DOCTOR: It burnt.
MASTER: And the Time Lords?
DOCTOR: Dead. And the Daleks, more or less. What happened to you?
MASTER: The Time Lords only resurrected me because they knew I'd be the perfect warrior for a
MASTER : Time War. I was there when the
MASTER: Dalek Emperor took control of the Cruciform. I saw it. I ran. I ran so far. Made myself human so they would never find me, because I was so scared.
DOCTOR: I know.
MASTER: All of them? But not you, which must mean
DOCTOR: I was the only one who could end it. And I tried. I did. I tried everything.
MASTER: What did it feel like, though? Two almighty civilisations burning. Oh, tell me, how did that feel?
DOCTOR: Stop it!
MASTER : You must have been like God.
DOCTOR: I've been alone ever since. But not anymore. Don't you see? All we've got is each other.
MASTER: Are you asking me out on a date?
DOCTOR: You could stop this right now. We could leave this planet. We can fight across the constellations, if that's what you want, but not on Earth.
MASTER: Too late.
DOCTOR: Why do you say that?
MASTER: The drumming. Can't you hear it? I thought it would stop, but it never does. Never ever stops. Inside my head, the drumming, Doctor. The constant drumming.
DOCTOR: I could help you. Please, let me help.
MASTER: It's everywhere. Listen, listen, listen. Here come the drums. Here come the drums.
DOCTOR: What have you done? Tell me how you've done this. What are those creatures? Tell me!
MASTER: Ooo look. You're on TV.
DOCTOR: Stop it. Answer me.
MASTER: No, really. You're on telly. You and your little band, which,
MASTER : By the way, is ticking every demographic box. So, congratulations on that. Look, there you are.
 
NEWS 24: Known as the Captain. They are known to be armed and extremely dangerous.
MASTER: You're public enemies number one, two and three. Oh, and you can tell handsome Jack that I've sent his little gang
MASTER : Off on a wild goose chase to the Himalayas, so he won't be getting any help from them.
MASTER: Now, go on, off you go. Why not start by turning to the right?
DOCTOR: He can see us.
MASTER: Oh, you public menace. Better start running. Go on, run.
DOCTOR: He's got control of everything.
MARTHA: What do we do?
JACK: We've got nowhere to go.
MARTHA: Doctor, what do we do?
MASTER : Run, Doctor.
MASTER: Run for your life!
DOCTOR: We run.
MASTER: I said, run!
NEWS 24: Tomorrow morning, Britain will be welcoming an extraterrestrial species 
AMNN: The President is said to be furious that Great Britain has taken unilateral action.
MASTER: Have you seen these things? This planet's amazing. Television in their stomach. Now that is evolution.
FEMALE SPHERE: Is the machine ready?
MASTER: Tomorrow morning. It reaches critical at eight oh two precisely.
FEMALE SPHERE: We have to escape, because it's coming, sir. The darkness, the never ending darkness. The terrible, terrible cold. We have to run and run and run!
MASTER: Eight o'clock tomorrow morning. Tell your people the world is waiting.
JACK: How was it?
MARTHA: I don't think anyone saw me. Anything new?
JACK: I've got this tuned to government wavelengths so we can follow what Saxon's doing.
MARTHA: Yeah, I meant about my family.
DOCTOR: It still says the Jones family taken in for questioning. Tell you what, though. No mention of Leo.
MARTHA: He's not as daft as he looks. I'm talking about my brother on the run. How did this happen?
JACK: Nice chips.
DOCTOR: Actually, they're not bad.
JACK: So, Doctor, who is he? How come the ancient society of Time Lords created a psychopath?
MARTHA: And what is he to you? Like a colleague or
DOCTOR: A friend, at first.
MARTHA: I thought you were going to say he was your secret brother or something.
DOCTOR: You've been watching too much TV.
JACK: But all the legends of Gallifrey made it sound so perfect.
DOCTOR: Well, perfect to look at, maybe. And it was. It was beautiful. They used to call it the Shining World of the Seven Systems. And on the Continent of Wild Endeavour, in the Mountains of Solace and Solitude, there stood the Citadel of the Time Lords, the oldest and most mighty race in the universe, looking down on the galaxies below. Sworn never to interfere, only to watch. Children of Gallifrey, taken from their families age of eight to enter the Academy. And some say that's when it all began. When he was a child. That's when the Master saw eternity. As a novice, he was taken for initiation. He stood in front of the Untempered Schism. It's a gap in the fabric of reality through which could be seen the whole of the vortex. You stand there, eight years old, staring at the raw power of time and space, just a child. Some would be inspired, some would run away, and some would go mad. Brr. I don't know.
MARTHA: What about you?
DOCTOR: Oh, the ones that ran away, I never stopped.
JACK: Encrypted channel with files attached. Don't recognise it.
DOCTOR: Patch it through to the laptop.
JACK: Since we're telling stories, there's something I haven't told you.
DOCTOR: You work for Torchwood.
JACK: I swear to you, it's different. It's changed. There's only half a dozen of us now.
DOCTOR: Everything Torchwood did, and you're part of it?
JACK: The old regime was destroyed at Canary Wharf. I rebuilt it, I changed it, and when I did that, I did it for you in your honour.
VIVIEN : If I haven't returned to my desk by twenty two hundred, this file will be emailed to Torchwood. Which means if you're watching this, then I'm. Anyway, the Saxon files are attached. But take a look at the Archangel document. That's when it all started. When Harry Saxon became Minister in charge of launching the Archangel Network.
DOCTOR: What's the Archangel Network?
MARTHA: I've got Archangel. Everyone's got it.
JACK: It's a mobile phone network. Because look, it's gone worldwide. They've got fifteen satellites in orbit. Even the other networks, they're all carried by Archangel.
DOCTOR: It's in the phones! Oh, I said he was a hypnotist. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
DOCTOR: There it is. That rhythm, it's everywhere, ticking away in the subconscious.
MARTHA: What is it, mind control?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, no. It's subtler than that. Any stronger and people would question it. But contained in that rhythm, in layers of code, Vote Saxon. Believe in me. Whispering to the world. Oh, yes! That's how he hid himself from me, because I should have sensed there was another Time Lord on Earth. I should have known way back. The signal cancelled him out.
JACK: Any way you can stop it?
DOCTOR: Not from down here. But now we know how he's doing it.
MARTHA: And we can fight back.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes!
DOCTOR: Three Tardis keys. Three pieces of the Tardis, all with low level perception properties because the Tardis is designed to blend in. Well, sort of. But now, the Archangel Network's got a second low level signal. Weld the key to the network and Martha, look at me. You can see me, yes?
MARTHA: Yes.
DOCTOR: What about now?
DOCTOR: No, I'm here. Look at me.
MARTHA: It's like I know you're there, but I don't want to know.
DOCTOR: And back again. See? It just shifts your perception a tiny little bit. Doesn't make us invisible, just unnoticed. Oh, I know what it's like. It's like, it's like when you fancy someone and they don't even know you exist. That's what it's like. Come on.
JACK: You too, huh?
DOCTOR: Don't run, don't shout. Just keep your voice down. Draw attention to yourself and the spell is broken. Just keep to the shadows.
JACK: Like ghosts.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's what we are. Ghosts.
NEWS 24: And as they eyes of the world turn towards Great Britain, sources indicate that Air Force One has landed on British soil tonight.
MASTER: Mister President, sir.
WINTERS: Mister Saxon, the British Army will stand down. From now on, UNIT has control of this operation.
MASTER: You make it sound like an invasion.
WINTERS: First Contact policy was decided by the Security Council in 1968, and you've just gone and ignored it.
MASTER: Well, you know what it's like. New job, all that paperwork. I think it's down the back of the settee. I did have a quick look. I found a pen, a sweet, a bus ticket and er, have you met the wife?
WINTERS: Mister Saxon, I'm not sure what your game is but there are provisions at the United Nations to have you removed from office unless you are very, very careful. Is that understood? Are you taking this seriously? To business. We've accessed your files on these Toclafane.
WINTERS: First Contact cannot take place on any sovereign soil. To that purpose, the aircraft carrier Valiant is en route. The rendezvous will take place there at eight am. You're trying my patience, sir.
MASTER: So America is completely in charge?
WINTERS: Since Britain elected an ass, yes. I'll see you onboard the Valiant.
MASTER: It still will be televised, though, won't it. Because I promised, and the whole world is watching.
WINTERS: Since it's too late to pull out, the world will be watching. Me.
MASTER: The last President of America. We have a private plane ready and waiting. We should reach the Valiant within the hour. My darling.
MASTER: Ha ha ha! Hi, guys!
CLIVE: You can't just do this.
MASTER: All will be revealed.
MARTHA: Oh my God.
DOCTOR: Don't move.
MARTHA: But the
DOCTOR: Don't.
MARTHA: I'm going to kill him.
JACK: What say I use this perception filter to walk up behind him and break his neck?
DOCTOR: Now that sounds like Torchwood.
JACK: Still a good plan.
DOCTOR: He's a Time Lord, which makes him my responsibility. I'm not here to kill him. I'm here to save him.
JACK: Aircraft carrier Valiant. It's a UNIT ship at fifty eight point two north, ten point oh two east.
MARTHA: How do we get on board?
DOCTOR: Does that thing work as a teleport?
JACK: Since you revamped it, yeah. Coordinates set.
MARTHA: Oh, that thing is rough.
JACK: I've has worse nights. Welcome to the Valiant.
MARTHA: It's dawn? Hold on, I thought this was a ship. Where's the sea?
JACK: A ship for the twenty first century, protecting the skies of planet Earth.
TANNOY: Europe now online. Awaiting confirmation from South America. And keep tracking Japan.
WINTERS: I want the whole thing branded in my suit of office, not the UN. You got that?
WOMAN: This material is being transmitted prior to transmission.
MASTER: Anything I can do? I could make the tea, or isn't that American enough? I don't know, I could make grits. What are grits, anyway?
WINTERS: It you could just sit.
MASTER: Misery guts. What do you think? It's good, isn't it?
LUCY: It's beautiful.
MASTER: Some of my best work. Ministry of Defence. I helped design this place. Every detail.
JACK: We've no time for sightseeing.
DOCTOR: No, wait. Shush, shush, shush, shush. Can't you hear it?
JACK: Hear what?
MARTHA: Doctor, my family's on board.
DOCTOR: Brilliant. This way.
DOCTOR: Oh, at last!
MARTHA: Oh, yes!
JACK: What's it doing on the Valiant?
JACK: What the hell's he done?
DOCTOR: Don't touch it.
JACK: I'm not going to.
MARTHA: What's he done though? Sounds like it's sick.
DOCTOR: It can't be. No, no, no, no, no, no, it can't be.
MARTHA: Doctor, what is it?
DOCTOR: He's cannibalised the Tardis.
JACK: Is this what I think it is?
DOCTOR: It's a paradox machine.
WINTERS: Two minutes, everyone.
WINTERS: According to the treaty, all armed personnel are requested to leave the flight deck immediately. Thank you.
TANNOY: Five, four, three, two, one.
MASTER: Jelly baby?
WINTERS: Broadcasting at seven fifty eight with the arrival timed for eight hundred hours exactly. And, er, good luck to all of us.
DOCTOR: As soon as this hits red, it activates. At this speed, it'll trigger at two minutes past eight.
JACK: First contact is at eight, then two minutes later
MARTHA: What's it for? What does a paradox machine do?
JACK: More important, can you stop it?
DOCTOR: Not till I know what it's doing. Touch the wrong bit, blow up the solar system.
MARTHA: Then we've got to get to the Master.
JACK: Yeah. How are we going to stop him?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've got a way. Sorry, didn't I mention it?
NEWS 24: And in just thirty seconds' time, we'll be going live to First Contact. It's been announced that Harold Saxon has invited President Winters to take the address.
AMNN: It's three am in the morning on the eastern seaboard and President Winters has been chosen to lead the world into a new age.
WINTERS: My fellow Americans, patriots, people of the world. I stand before you today as ambassador for humanity, a role I will undertake with the utmost solemnity. Perhaps our Toclafane cousins can offer us much, but what is important is not that we gain material benefits, but that we learn to see ourselves anew.
WINTERS: For as long as man has looked at the stars, he has wondered what mysteries they hold. Now we know we are not alone.
JACK:  This plan, you going to tell us?
WINTERS: No longer unique in the universe.
DOCTOR: If I can get this around the Master's neck, cancel out his perception, they'll see him for real. It's just hard to go unnoticed with everyone on red alert. If they stop me you've got a key.
JACK: Yes, sir.
MARTHA: I'll get him.
WINTERS: And I ask you now, I ask of the human race, to join with me in welcoming our friends. I give you the Toclafane.
WINTERS: My name is Arthur Coleman Winters, President Elect of the United States of America, and designated representative of the United Nations. I welcome you to the planet Earth and its associated moon.
MALE SPHERE: You're not the Master.
FEMALE SPHERE: We like the Mister Master.
MALE SPHERE 2: We don't like you.
WINTERS: I can be master, if you so wish. I will accept mastery over you, if that is God's will.
MALE SPHERE 2: Man is stupid.
MALE SPHERE: Master is our friend.
FEMALE SPHERE Where's my Master, pretty please?
MASTER: Oh, all right then. It's me. Ta da! Sorry, sorry, I have this effect. People just get obsessed. Is it the smile? Is it the aftershave? Is it the capacity to laugh at myself? I don't know. It's crazy.
WINTERS: Saxon, what are you talking about?
MASTER: I'm taking control, Uncle Sam, starting with you. Kill him.
MASTER: Guards.
GUARD: Nobody move! Nobody move!
MASTER: Now then, peoples of the Earth. Please attend carefully.
GUARD: Stop him!
MASTER: We meet at last, Doctor. Oh, ho. I love saying that.
DOCTOR: Stop it! Stop it now!
MASTER: As if a perception filter's going to work on me. And look, it's the girlie and the freak. Although, I'm not sure which one's which.
MASTER: Laser screwdriver. Who'd have sonic? And the good thing is, he's not dead for long. I get to kill him again!
DOCTOR: Master, just calm down. Just look at what you're doing. Just stop. If you could see yourself
MASTER: Oh, do excuse me. Little bit of personal business. Back in a minute. Let him go.
DOCTOR: It's that sound. The sound in your head. What if I could help?
MASTER: Oh, how to shut him up? I know. Memory Lane. Professor Lazarus. Remember him and his genetic manipulation device? What, did you think that little Tish got that job merely by coincidence? I've been laying traps for you all this time. And if I can concentrate all that Lazarus technology into one little screwdriver? But, ooo, if I only had the Doctor's biological code. Oh, wait a minute, I do.
MASTER: I've got his hand. And if Lazarus made himself younger, what if I reverse it? Another hundred years?
JACK: Teleport.
MARTHA: I can't.
JACK: We can't stop him. Get out of here. Get out.
MARTHA: Doctor? I've got you.
MASTER: Ah, she's a would be doctor. But tonight, Martha Jones, we've flown them in all the way from prison.
GUARD: Come on, move.
MARTHA: Mum.
FRANCINE: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: The Toclafane. What are they? Who are they?
MASTER: Doctor, if I told you the truth, your hearts would break.
MALE SPHERE: Is it time? Is it ready?
FEMALE SPHERE: Is the machine singing?
MASTER: Two minutes past. So, Earthings. Basically, er, end of the world. Here come the drums!
SINGER: Here come the drums. Here come the drums. Baby, baby, baby. You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe.
SINGER: It's supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child. Don't say maybe, maybe. It's supernatural. I'm coming undone. Baby, baby, baby. You are my voodoo child, my voodoo child.
MASTER: How many do you think?
LUCY: I, I don't know.
MASTER: Six billion. Down you go, kids!
MASTER: Shall we decimate them? That sounds good. A nice word, decimate. Remove one tenth of the population!
GENEVA : Valiant, this is Geneva. We're getting slaughtered down here. Valiant, report. Help us. For God's sake, help us! They're everywhere!
LONDON : This is London, Valiant. This is London calling. What do we do? They're killing us! The Toclafane are all around. They're killing us. 
MARTHA: I'm coming back.
MASTER: And so it came to pass that the human race fell, and the Earth was no more. And I looked down upon my new dominion as Master of all, and I thought it good.
