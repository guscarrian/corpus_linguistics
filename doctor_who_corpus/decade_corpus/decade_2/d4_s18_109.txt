The Leisure Hive
Part One
ROMANA: I don't think much of this Earth idea of recreation. Why can't we do something constructive?
K9: Sea bathing recommended. A traditional Earth exercise, mistress.
ROMANA: Well, go on, then. You exercise. Fetch!
ROMANA: K9!
ROMANA: K9!
DOCTOR: Ow!
ROMANA: Look what you've done.
DOCTOR: What have I done?
ROMANA: You've got the century wrong, you've got the season wrong and you've got K9's sea-water defences wrong.
DOCTOR: Well, I can't get everything right.
ROMANA: Just something would be a help.
DOCTOR: One must always accept the unexpected.
ROMANA: Well, that's not what you said when we first arrived.
DOCTOR: Well, that's different. This is the second time I've missed the opening of the Brighton Pavilion.
ROMANA: Right place, wrong time.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: Well, you know how dangerous it is bypassing the randomiser.
DOCTOR: Well, I can't spend the rest of my life running away from the Black Guardian.
ROMANA: We should be safe here. I shouldn't think even he fancies freezing to death on Brighton beach.
DOCTOR: Do you have a better suggestion?
ROMANA: I certainly have.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: K9's given me a complete list of recreation facilities in this galaxy.
DOCTOR: Fascinating?
ROMANA: I like the sound of Argolis.
DOCTOR: Argolis? Tell me about it.
ROMANA: It's the first of the leisure planets. In relative Earth date 2250, there's a hideous war against some reptile people called the Foamasi. Most of the planet gets wiped out by two thousand interplanetary missiles, but the survivors build a recreation centre called the Leisure Hive. And there's something called an Experiential Grid. Cells of different environments designed to produce physical, psychic and intellectual regeneration. That sounds more like it, don't you think, Doctor? Doctor?
VARGOS: Dangerous, ladies and gentlemen. Dangerous because the atmosphere out there is deadly.
TANNOY: Guide Vargos wanted in the boardroom. Guide Vargos wanted in the boardroom.
VARGOS: Vargos acknowledging. Ladies and gentlemen, I leave you to enjoy the celebrated view of Argolis from the safety of the Hive. I will return shortly.
BROCK  : I must tell you that even those based on optimum exploitation predict a serious financial down run. That is the optimistic scenario.
PANGOL: You won't believe this. Brock looks like backing out.
BROCK : However one fact is absolutely clear. Argolis is suffering from an escalating negative cash flow.
PANGOL: What's that mean in plain language?
BROCK : Bluntly, Argolis is headed for bankruptcy.
 
MORIX: This Leisure Hive is expensive to maintain. Bookings last year were bad.
BROCK : And next year looks catastrophic. I do apologise for the unfortunate choice of words.
PANGOL: You're our Earth agent, Brock. You're responsible for bookings.
MORIX: Calmly, my son.
BROCK : Argolis is out of date. Planets like Limnos Four, Abydos are much more competitive.
VARGOS: I hear they have non-gravity swimming pools.
BROCK  : And sleep-reading stations. Accelerated learning experiences that cover every subject of the Technic Index.
PANGOL: And such vital pastimes as robotic gladiatorial games. So what? Which of these other planets has created a whole new science?
BROCK : Argolis is justly proud of tachyonics, but that science, you will admit, remains, after forty years, little more than a curiosity.
PANGOL: There are developments.
BROCK [hologram: I've heard these rumours, yes, but then again, these expensive experiments return us to the question of finance. No, I regret I must turn down your kind offer to join you on the board and decline your invitation to invest. Nevertheless
MORIX: That was discourteous, Pangol. There must be no aggression on Argolis. You have only to look at me to be reminded of that.
Shuttlebay
TANNOY: Attention. Earth shuttle arriving. Attention. Earth shuttle arriving.
MORIX: At least wait until your mother returns.
PANGOL: You're the chairman.
MORIX: And she will be the next. Are you not even curious to know the results of the Earth experiments?
PANGOL: Mena's Earth scientist. What does he know about tachyonics?
VARGOS: Earth Agent Brock to see you, sir.
PANGOL: Brock! Come to convey his insult personally, no doubt.
BROCK: Mister Chairman, after all our years of dealings over the telecommunicator, here I am at last. My dear Pangol.
It's good to see you, Mister Chairman. But Morix, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.
PANGOL: Have a look. It's the way we Argolins die.
MORIX: You must forgive my son, Brock.
BROCK: Oh. Klout, my lawyer.
PANGOL: Lawyer?
BROCK: Yes, I've decided to accept the directorship.
MORIX: I'm very pleased.
BROCK: The question of investment we'll keep on hold for the moment. It may not be necessary. I've had an offer from another group.
MORIX: To finance us?
BROCK: Not exactly, Mister Chairman. They want to buy you out.
MORIX: We cannot leave the Hive. No one can survive outside it.
BROCK: They want it all. The whole of Argolis.
PANGOL: No. It's not for sale.
BROCK: A dead world in a radioactive atmosphere?
TANNOY: Demonstration of the Tachyon Recreation Generator is about to start.
MORIX: It seems you are wanted, my son. You have duties. Perform them!
PANGOL: Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. What you're seeing is non-gravity squash.
PANGOL: A solid image relayed from our own squash courts. The Generator powers the game as well as relaying the image.
PANGOL: Over the years, visitors have been interested in the tricks it is possible to play with these solid images. So by way of a preface to the scientific analysis that follows let me demonstrate some of the more spectacular possibilities.
DOCTOR: It's got to be unreal transfer.
ROMANA: Why has it got to be?
DOCTOR: It's the only way to manipulate solid objects.
ROMANA: What if I told you this part of the galaxy doesn't discover unreal transfer until 2386?
DOCTOR: Then how is it done?
ROMANA: I don't know.
PANGOL: Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen, everything is under control.
PANGOL: Or nearly everything.
MORIX: Do you seriously advise me to sell Argolis to the very race against whom we fought the war?
BROCK: An excellent solution, surely.
MORIX: It's as well my son did not hear this.
BROCK: But that war has been lost and won. What we're discussing here is business.
MORIX: For some Argolins, that war leaves a bitter memory.
BROCK: For your son, perhaps.
MORIX: Pangol is sensitive to all aliens. Natural, I suppose, in the youngest of a race that was all but wiped out.
BROCK: I sympathise. Personally, those Foamasi make my skin crawl. It must be the green scales.
MORIX: Oh, come now, Brock. Part of the business of this Hive is to develop cross-cultural understanding. The Foamasi are reptiles with highly developed intelligence. I don't suppose either you or I appear particularly attractive to them.
BROCK: True. And quite frankly, I can't think what they want with Argolis.
MORIX: That's easily answered. Reptiles are resistant to radioactivity. There's only one lifeform in the galaxy that could live out there on the surface.
BROCK: The Foamasi?
MORIX: Precisely.
MORIX: But to be forced to sell them our planet, our home. Would not that be the ultimate defeat?
PANGOL: The development of tachyonics to the stage you see it now and incidentally, the spectacular luminosity you've all been admiring, are both a direct result of the war.
ROMANA: Tachyonics. The tachyon was first hypothesised on Earth.
PANGOL: As you know, tachyons travel faster than light. 
DOCTOR: Yes. Nobody there did much with it.
ROMANA: No.
PANGOL: A tachyon field can therefore be made to arrive at point B, that visidome, say, before it's departure from point A, the Generator. For the next hour and a half, we will examine the wave equations that define the creation of solid tachyonic images.
MORIX: I, will not sell, Brock.
BROCK: Morix! Morix! Where is everyone? For goodness sake, get somebody!
ARGOLIN: How long has he been like this?
BROCK: Just now. Is there anything we can do?
VARGOS: Nothing. His time has come.
PANGOL: This, incidentally, was the stumbling block in our first series of practical experiments. Paradoxically, the solution is to introduce a random component into the tachyon emission, as long as we can deduct
TANNOY: Attention. Earth shuttle arriving. Attention. Earth shuttle arriving.
BROCK: My dear Mena, I must say how sorry I am about Morix. He was a fine Argolin.
MENA: He did his duty. I automatically become Chairman in his place.
ARGOLIN 2: We expected you to bring the Earth scientist with you.
MENA: Hardin and his assistant will be here by the next shuttle. Meanwhile, I have a holocrystal of the first trial.
BROCK: Pangol will want to see this.
MENA: Leave him to his work.
GUIDE: Your son has no great love for this Earth scientist, I believe?
MENA: He resents the fact that Hardin has found a better use for tachyonics than these Argolin games.
BROCK: A better use?
MENA: Yes, Brock. A better use. Hardin has learned to manipulate time.
PANGOL: And this matching tachyon field creates a temporary reduplication of any physical object. Are there any questions?
DOCTOR: Do you know, I'd completely forgotten about tachyonics. Some of those Argolin solutions are really quite neat.
ROMANA: Especially the duration problem.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PANGOL: As I demonstrated earlier myself. Visitor Loman thinks the demonstration might have been an edited recording. Perhaps you'd care to try for yourself, Mister Loman?
DOCTOR: I suppose in theory a tachyon image could never be permanent.
PANGOL: First the projection.
PANGOL: Two temporarily coincident Lomans are now in existence. Now we can manipulate one without harming the other.
PANGOL: No need to panic, ladies and gentlemen.
DOCTOR: Something's gone wrong!
PANGOL: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm a doctor.
PANGOL: Doctor? The scientist?
ROMANA: Yes, of course.
PANGOL: My mother's most anxious to meet this gentleman.
DOCTOR: He's terribly hurt. Come on, clear the area. Clear the area!
PANGOL: Medical facility to the Recreation Generator.)
ROMANA: His mother's most anxious to meet you.
DOCTOR: His mother?
GUIDE: Madam Chairman wishes to see you, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes, but who's in charge here?
GUIDE: Madam Chairman, sir.
ROMANA: Must be his mother.
DOCTOR: His mother? Good. You, take me to his mother. Come, Romana on.
GUIDE: This way, sir.
BROCK: Morik sent you all the way to Earth just for this?
MENA: Watch.
HARDIN : Now, in this experiment we propose to explore the temporal anomaly inherent in the tachyon.
BROCK: What is he talking about?
MENA: The tachyon travels faster than light. We always knew time mechanics was theoretically possible. Watch.
HARDIN : The device is now activated.
BROCK: What's supposed to be happening?
MENA: Watch.
BROCK: I don't believe it.
MENA: Rejuvenation. Complete cellular rejuvenation. Hardin has perfected a technique that works for living entities.
BROCK: No wonder there's so much secrecy about these experiments.
DOCTOR: Hello. How do you do?  Who are you? I've got something very special here. You'll like it.
MENA: Stop. Stop! Who are you?
DOCTOR: Who am I? Ask him.
GUIDE: The Earth scientist, Hardin. You were expecting him, Madam Chairman.
MENA: But this isn't Hardin.
DOCTOR: No, but it's a very understandable mistake.
MENA: How did you get here? All our visitors have identification.
DOCTOR: Ah, well, we must have missed the usual channels, as usual.
GUIDE: They were taking notes at the lecture, Madam Chairman.
MENA: And now they have seen the Earth experiments.
DOCTOR: Well, just a glimpse, perhaps.
TANNOY: The medical centre requests instructions. Earth Visitor Loman is now dead.
MENA: Dead? Prepare the body for repatriation. We must investigate this thoroughly.
MENA: Where have those two gone? I want them brought back here immediately.
ROMANA: That experiment was a fake, you know that.
DOCTOR: You spotted that? Good. Let's get back to the Tardis.
ARGOLIN: Can I help you?
DOCTOR: No, thank you. We're just on our way out, actually. Oh, by the way, there are two unauthorised visitors on the premises. Keep an ear cocked for a description.
ARGOLIN: Thank you.
MENA: Attention. Warn all security guides to be on the alert for two unidentified visitors. Description.
MENA : One tall curly-headed humanoid in the company of young humanoid female.
DOCTOR: Don't let me interrupt you, gentlemen. Two discontinuous holograms have been edited together.
ROMANA: Have they?
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed vague interference patterns.
ROMANA: And you noticed the necklace, of course.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: The clothes were the same but the necklace was different.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, that too of course.
ROMANA: Of course.
DOCTOR: Why are they so competitive?
DOCTOR: I wonder. I wonder.
ROMANA: Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fascinating. Fascinating.
ROMANA: Doctor? Doctor! Doctor!
Part Two
ROMANA: Doctor!
BROCK: There's one of them!
ROMANA: Help me! The Doctor's in there.
PANGOL: How did he activate it from inside?
ROMANA: Get him out of there.
PANGOL: It's jammed!
ROMANA: Switch off the power.
PANGOL: I can't!
ROMANA: There must be something we can do.
DOCTOR: Well, you could try shorting the servo lock on the door.
PANGOL: Of course.
DOCTOR: Well, it's just a thought. Something wrong?
TANNOY: Attention. Earth shuttle arriving. Earth shuttle arriving.
TANNOY: Earth Scientist Hardin to the boardroom. Earth Scientist Hardin to the boardroom.
DOCTOR: Handsome fellow, isn't he? One of your tachyon images. It'll disappear soon, look.
DOCTOR: See?
PANGOL: How did you get out?
DOCTOR: Through a hole in the back.
PANGOL: But there isn't one.
DOCTOR: There is now.
DOCTOR: You see, a common fault with tachyon particles is that they can induce a certain temporal instability in surrounding matter.
DOCTOR: What can I do for you?
DOCTOR : Come on, Romana, quick.
MINA: Have you ever seen him before, Hardin?
HARDIN: No, Madam Chairman.
MINA: Such formality.
HARDIN: I must respect your new position. Not that I, er, that there was ever
MINA: Not that there was ever any disrespect. For all your genius, Hardin, you're young. But you're right. My new responsibilities will put a distance between us. This scientist seems to understand tachyonics to a very advanced level. He's mentioned temporal instability. How much does he know?
HARDIN: I'll have to question him. Of course, he may be useful.
MINA: Useful?
HARDIN: If he has a genuine understanding of the instability.
MINA: But the work's done, the problem's solved, thanks to you.
HARDIN: Well, there may be certain adjustments on the full-scale run with the Generator.
MINA: But you said at our very first meeting that the problems were solved.
HARDIN: Yes, Madam Chairman. I merely suggest
MINA: Ah. Where do you come from?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey?
MINA: I've never heard of it.
DOCTOR: Well, it's just an obscure little planet in the constellation of Kasterborous and we're overdue. I think we should be on our way.
MINA: Wait. Have you ever experimented with time?
DOCTOR: Well, yes, but in a purely academic way of no interest to anyone.
MINA: Earth Visitor Hardin thinks that you might be able to help with his experiments.
DOCTOR: Well, I'd like to
ROMANA: Gallifrey abandoned tachyonics when we developed warp matrix engineering.
DOCTOR: Yes, there you are, so sorry.
HARDIN: You saw the time experiment?
DOCTOR: Well, just a glimpse, perhaps.
ROMANA: I assumed it was based on negative tachyon displacement, didn't you?
MINA: I'd like you both to take another look at those experiments.
ROMANA: Then can we go?
MINA: We are a peaceful people, but you are unidentified visitors. Our decision will depend on your conduct.
DOCTOR: All right, but we'd better rerun the experiment, don't you think, Mister Hardin?
ROMANA: It's beautiful.
DOCTOR: Yes. Radon 222 decays rapidly.
MINA: But not the heavy metal dust. It won't be habitable for three centuries.
DOCTOR: Really? Why, how long did the war last?
MINA: Twenty minutes.
DOCTOR: As long as that.
MINA: Now you understand the purpose of the Hive.
ROMANA: To keep out the atmosphere.
MINA: The physical reason, yes, but the purpose is to promote understanding between life forms of all culture and genetic type. There must be no more such wars.
DOCTOR: So it's not just a recreation centre.
MINA: Even the games in our Experiential Grid explore alien environments. Each race learns to understand what it is like to be the foreigner.
ROMANA: Like learning a language.
MINA: Language and thought. Let me show you the grid.
MINA: This simulation is a high gravity planet with a life form
MINA: Oh, no, not again. This is intolerable.
ROMANA: What happened?
MINA: Interfibral malfunction. A line's gone down. So many faults, accidents, the death this morning.
DOCTOR: Do you think the Hive's being interfered with?
MINA: The fibreoptic transmission system has a mean time between failure of two thousand years.
DOCTOR: We could do with that in the Tardis.
MINA: It's far in excess of our own needs.
ROMANA: Future generations will appreciate it.
MINA: The few of us who survived the war have our own price to pay. There will be no future generations.
VARGOS : The transmission fault has been identified, Madam Chairman.
MINA: Show me.
ROMANA: Does she mean they're sterile?
DOCTOR: Yes. This Leisure Hive is the Argolin farewell gesture.
DOCTOR: What is it?
MINA: Please don't worry. This is quite normal.
DOCTOR: Normal? But you're ill.
MINA: I'll recover in a moment.
ROMANA: But you look older.
DOCTOR: Shush.
MINA: Yes. The war has done this to us, too. A slow, steady metabolism for most of our lives and then. This has come to me sooner than I thought.
BROCK: But don't you see, Hardin? This idea of yours could be the saving of the Hive.
HARDIN: It'll give the Argolins a few more years to live. Perhaps
BROCK: Secondly, think of the impact on the visitors. At the moment this Experiential Grid leaves them older and wiser, but with this they could go home younger and wiser.
HARDIN: Look, I cannot demonstrate it now!
BROCK: Is something wrong?
HARDIN: No. No, it takes time.
BROCK: Oh, it's a time experiment. We'll be back.
STIMSON: Don't lose your nerve, Hardin. We can work it.
HARDIN: Why did I ever let you talk me into faking this in the first place?
STIMSON: Fake? It's a breakthrough in tachyon technology. Your dreams come true.
HARDIN: Success was so close.
STIMSON: It still is, if you don't panic.
HARDIN: But this isn't science.
STIMSON: While you're operating on my funds you'll do it my way. Proceed as planned.
HARDIN: I can't. Mena wants to bring in the Doctor.
STIMSON: What? You blind idiot.
HARDIN: Well, don't you see? These people could have the answer.
STIMSON: But if they find this is a fake, we're ruined.
HARDIN: All right, all right, I'll find a way. I'll persuade Mena not to let them in here.
STIMSON: Get them to stay out there and watch on the viewer.
HARDIN: All right.
MENA: Are the preparations complete?
HARDIN: Soon, Madam Chairman.
DOCTOR: Is that a Schr�dinger oscillator?
HARDIN: Stay back.
DOCTOR: Why?
HARDIN: There's a question of radiation hazard.
DOCTOR: Oh, really.
HARDIN:  We've got to make this work. Can't you see what's happening?
STIMSON: Surely that's not the woman we saw on Earth?
HARDIN: Yes.
MENA: When will it be ready, Mister Hardin?
HARDIN: Soon, Madam Chairman. The er, the adjustments have to be exact.
STIMSON: You'll all get a better view, you know, from up top.
ROMANA: Can I help you, Mister Hardin? Thank you.
ROMANA: Now, this is a wafer wave inducer, is it?
HARDIN: Yes, it feeds direct from the tachyon drive.
ROMANA: And what do you do for inversion?
HARDIN: It doesn't invert. The divider circuit automatically dephases. Mena's dying, and nothing can stop that cellular degeneration once it starts.
ROMANA: This could. Come on, Hardin. How do you lock the phase?
HARDIN: I can't. It doesn't. It doesn't really work, you know.
VARGOS: Can I help you, Mister Stimson?
STIMSON: It's imperative that I leave for Earth immediately.
VARGOS: Ah. All the shuttles are fully booked, unless you can obtain a special clearance from one of the directors.
STIMSON: Thank you.
STIMSON: Mister Brock? Mister Brock.
STIMSON: Anyone there?
STIMSON: Argh!
ROMANA: Switch on.
HARDIN: Right.
ROMANA: Hold it there.
HARDIN: Stasis.
ROMANA: Looks like it.
HARDIN: We've brought time to a stop.
ROMANA: But can we wind time back, return the sand to where it was before it fell?
HARDIN: I just don't get this. In theory it should be functioning perfectly.
ROMANA: We'll just have to check it all again. That's one thing I've learnt from the Doctor. Where is he, by the way?
COMPUTER: Override failsafe. Override failsafe. Eliminate intruder. Eliminate intruder.
DOCTOR: Ah, so that's how it's done.
BROCK: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, thank you.
BROCK: This is your scarf, isn't it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PANGOL: The murderer.
BROCK: His scarf killed Stimson.
DOCTOR: Arrest the scarf, then.
MENA: The court is sitting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
MENA: The court, Doctor.
MENA: We Argolins have a sacred reminder of the evil that dwells in violence. The Helmet of Theron, who led Argolis into the war that wiped it out. Can you swear your innocence before the Helmet of Theron?
DOCTOR: Yes.
MENA: Let me hear the facts of the case.
ROMANA: Ready?
HARDIN: Ready.
ROMANA: Start the recording now.
HARDIN: Recorder running.
ROMANA: Increase the power slowly. We don't want a sudden surge to blow everything to bits.
HARDIN: Four hundred and twenty five. Increasing. Four hundred and twenty nine. Four hundred and thirty one. Stable at four hundred and thirty five.
ROMANA: Nothing. Increase the power.
HARDIN: It's not going to work, I know it.
ROMANA: That's an unnecessary assumption. We must keep trying.
HARDIN: Yes, you're right. We must keep trying. Four hundred and forty eight. Stable at four hundred and forty eight.
ROMANA: Try four hundred and fifty.
HARDIN: Stable at four hundred and fifty.
ROMANA: Nothing. Wait a minute.
ROMANA: Yes! Yes!
HARDIN: We've done it!
ROMANA: Come on.
BROCK: And those are the facts, Madam Chairman.
MENA: Does that conclude the evidence?
DOCTOR: Evidence? Evidence? You couldn't hang a hat on that.
MENA: I'm the judge here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
BROCK: A murder has been committed and the murderer must be found.
MENA: Justice is what matters.
PANGOL: When Theron was in doubt he threw a man into fire or water. Let the elements try him.
MENA: These superstitions are not for us, Pangol.
DOCTOR: I've got an idea. There's a sort of blue box down the hall. You could imprison us both in that.
HARDIN: Mena, er, Madam Chairman. It works.
MENA: What?
HARDIN: Romana has solved the wave equations in all four dimensions.
MENA: You mean you really can rejuvenate?
ROMANA: Probably.
MENA: Then I'm prepared.
HARDIN: No. No, there must be one more test.
PANGOL: A test.
DOCTOR: Are you sure about this, Romana?
ROMANA: According to our calculations, the most it'll do is knock off ten or twelve years.
DOCTOR: Right. Then I'll take my chance.
ROMANA: We should be recording this.
HARDIN: Yes, of course. I forgot to switch it through from the lab.
ROMANA: You'll be needed here.
MENA: Think what this will mean to the Argolin.
PANGOL: A few years gain for an individual, perhaps.
BROCK: We're ready, then?
HARDIN: I'll start the warm-up now.
ROMANA: Doctor?
ROMANA: Stop! Stop. We forgot about something.
HARDIN: What? It's too late.
ROMANA: Get the Doctor out of there!
HARDIN: I can't.
Part Three
DOCTOR: Was I in there long? It felt like centuries.
HARDIN: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. A bit weak. Why? What are you all staring at?
BROCK: Have you seen yourself?
DOCTOR: No, not recently. Why, should I
DOCTOR: Is that me? What happened?
ROMANA: I don't know. Hardware malfunction. I don't understand.
DOCTOR: I was just going to check something in there. I can't remember what.
MENA: The Doctor is unwell. See that he is given a cabin.
PANGOL: And confine him there. He's still on trial for murder. Confine them both.
MENA: Very well. I declare a limitation on them both. Hardin, you will come with me.
MENA: Am I leaning too heavily on you?
HARDIN: No, Mena.
MENA: The distance between us seems to have lessened again. What went wrong with the experiment? I felt so sorry for you.
HARDIN: For me?
MENA: And for the Argolin, of course. It seemed to offer a last chance for us. Technology offered us hope once before, after the war.
HARDIN: Hope of survival? How?
MENA: It isn't something we talk of to outsiders.
HARDIN: It isn't the end. I know I can make it work. Don't despair.
MENA: Despair is the death of hope, and all our hope died years ago. The Helmet of Theron. His ambition laid waste the planet. We keep it there to remind us to live in humility.
HARDIN: To live, yes.
MENA: And to die with grace. Please, Hardin. Send for my attendants.
GUIDE: Your movements will be unrestricted provided you keep to the programme.
ROMANA: We're being programmed?
GUIDE: Vargos will explain.
VARGOS: The programme allows you to be in certain areas at certain times. The collars will only become uncomfortable if you attempt to depart from the programme. Or try to remove them.
PANGOL: This must be solved before dawn. The time is very close. Vargos?
VARGOS: Yes, Pangol?
PANGOL: Somehow or other the alien's trivial experiment is degrading the segmentation.
PANGOL: Your experiment draws power from the Generator, Hardin?
HARDIN: That's right.
PANGOL: My guides would like your help in removing it. We can't allow interference with our developments.
HARDIN: Developments? What do you mean?
PANGOL: I'm not going to discuss that with an alien. Besides, the tachyonic facilities are for scientific research, not fraud.
MENA: Fraud?
PANGOL: My guides have been through Stimson's effects. It's clear the experiments were rigged.
MENA: Is this true?
HARDIN: Well, I was on the verge of a breakthrough. I needed funds.
MENA: There was real hope for us and you allowed Stimson to cheat us.
HARDIN: But the test I made here with the girl Romana, they weren't fakes. We created negative time images. It worked!
PANGOL: Tell that to the Doctor.
HARDIN: Give me more time and I can prove it.
MENA: Let him have his wish. Give him access to the laboratory.
HARDIN: And Romana. I must have her help.
PANGOL: I don't trust this. It's a conspiracy.
MENA: Romana will stay where she is. Work on your own, Hardin.
DOCTOR: I'm sick of being old. There must be some way of reversing the process.
ROMANA: Temporal asymmetry. We'll have to get back to the Generator. Your condition's unstable.
DOCTOR: Pangol's very young.
ROMANA: Pangol?
DOCTOR: Yes. And everyone else is old, except Pangol. And he runs the Generator. When you were fitting the Schr�dinger oscillator, did you notice there were two baryon shields?
ROMANA: Mmm. Why two, I wonder?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I didn't have time to look. Five hundred years goes by so rapidly.
ROMANA: An alternative function? There must be a second circuit in there doing something we know nothing about.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes.
MENA: When the Chairmanship passes to you, Pangol, you'll moderate your views.
PANGOL: The ancient Greeks of Earth believed in moderation.
MENA: Athens was the seat of wisdom.
PANGOL: And it fell to the might of Rome.
PANGOL: What do you want, Earthling?
BROCK: Madam Chairman!
MENA: Don't be alarmed, Mister Brock. My medical attendants assure me that my termination is proceeding normally.
BROCK: I suppose you know that the shuttles have been packed to capacity with visitors leaving.
MENA: Two unfortunate accidents in one day.
BROCK: Two murders. An exodus. The value of this Foamasi offer must be falling by the hour. Tomorrow they may withdraw completely.
PANGOL: Good.
MENA: Have you a suggestion, Mister Brock?
PANGOL: A public trial and execution, perhaps?
BROCK: I had something more constructive in mind.
PANGOL: So have I. Who cares if an alien doctor lives or dies?
HARDIN: Mister Brock says you might be able to help by looking at the Recreation Generator.
DOCTOR: Really, it's astonishing how far the Argolins have come with tachyonics.
HARDIN: These are mere toys. My time experiments are the first glimpse of any real use for the Recreation Generator.
DOCTOR: Really? Are you sure of that?
HARDIN: Of course. The Argolins have nothing to show for their forty years work on tachyonics.
DOCTOR: No, nothing except a sort of cabinet of illusions. And then the name of the thing. Has that struck you?
ROMANA: The Generator?
DOCTOR: Recreation Generator. Re-creation.
ROMANA: Creating things again.
DOCTOR: Things, yes. Or people.
BROCK: The Foamasi are offering excellent terms.
PANGOL: Let me see that.
MENA: There is an alternative.
BROCK: What?
MENA: When the time comes, we will open the airlocks and together the Argolin will walk out onto the surface of their planet for the last time.
BROCK: Mass suicide? Why even consider it when you have these terms?
PANGOL: This isn't a Foamasi government document.
BROCK: Did I say it was? A private deal from a group of Foamasi citizens.
PANGOL: The West Lodge? I've never heard of them.
BROCK: They prefer a low profile. Bluntly, it's either them or bankruptcy.
PANGOL: There is a third possibility, Mister Brock, that Mena didn't mention.
BROCK: Oh?
PANGOL: The new Argolis.
DOCTOR: This way.
BROCK: This new Argolis, whatever that might be, will need funds.
PANGOL: From this forgery?
BROCK: I beg your pardon?
PANGOL: I know the Foamasi. I've studied them. Do you think my hatred has turned me into a blind fool?
MENA: There are no private enterprise groups among the Foamasi.
PANGOL: Another trick by the government. For years they've been trying to foist restitution money on us.
BROCK: Some small attempt to
PANGOL: For genocide, Brock?
BROCK: You said yourself that is not a government document.
PANGOL: The West Lodge. Ever since the war, the Foamasi government has owned the whole planet.
BROCK: Officially.
PANGOL: What?
BROCK: Private enterprise is irrepressible. I have several copies, of course.
MENA: Your West Lodge can raise that much money?
BROCK: Easily.
PANGOL: We don't need it. I have something better than money.
BROCK: A novel concept.
PANGOL: Manpower.
BROCK: Excuse me for reminding you that this is a sterile planet. There haven't been any Argolins born here since the war.
PANGOL: Which was forty years ago. But how old do you think I am, Mister Brock?
DOCTOR: The radiation out there affected the Argolin metabolism.
HARDIN: Yes, it produced this rapid aging effect.
DOCTOR: Yes, and made them sterile.
ROMANA: It's not re-creation, it's some sort of reduplication process going on in there.
DOCTOR: The implications of that could be very unpleasant.
ROMANA: We need to check out the Generator and find out what Pangol's up to.
HARDIN: I'll go.
ROMANA: No, it can't be you or the Doctor. I'm the only one who can go in the Generator while it's unstable.
DOCTOR: Yes, or else there might be, what do you call it?
ROMANA: Tachyon surge. If there is, I come out aged six hundred and fifty, but if you're in there. What we need is a diversion.
DOCTOR: Yes. Or even a plan would do.
MENA: No, Pangol! No!
PANGOL: It's time you understood, Mister Brock. You must be more stupid than you look. Mena is not my mother.
MENA: No, Pangol! You've said too much already.
BROCK: You mean you're not an Argolin?
PANGOL: Of course I'm an Argolin! The first of the new Argolin. I am the child of the Generator.
HARDIN: Psst! You, come on.
DOCTOR: Look at this, old thing.
DOCTOR: Do you know, I had a feeling he wasn't quite ready for the rigours of warp mechanics.
DOCTOR: Hadn't you better get him off to bed?
HARDIN: But you said
BROCK: You mean the Argolins donated cells from their bodies to this Recreation Generator and cloned themselves? There's a flaw in your story. Where are all the others?
MENA: The theory was still primitive. There were many failures.
BROCK: And yet he survived.
PANGOL: For twenty years a moratorium was declared on the technique, until I came of age, a thoroughly proficient tachyon engineer. There will be no more disfigured mutants in our next reduplication programme.
PANGOL: There is the future of the Argolins. Where are the guides?
PANGOL: How did he get there? Alert! Alert!
PANGOL: It's over there.
COMPUTER: Status update. Intruders.
PANGOL: It's all right, he's in here. Five hundred years the last time, Doctor. Let's see what you're like when you've aged two thousand.
DOCTOR: There's no doubt about it, all this rushing about takes it out of you, particularly when you're twelve hundred and fifty years old.
ROMANA: It's all right, he's a friend. He got me out of the Generator before Pangol started it up.
DOCTOR: Who is he?
ROMANA: I don't know.
DOCTOR: What? Doesn't make any sense to me.
HARDIN: Doctor!
ROMANA: Shush.
HARDIN: Romana, thank heavens you're safe.
DOCTOR: Shush. Don't interrupt. He's a Foamasi.
HARDIN: What's he doing on Argolis?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Ask him.
ROMANA: Well, at least he showed me why our rejuvenation process doesn't work. We found this behind the second baryon shield.
HARDIN: Doctor, what do you make of this?
DOCTOR: Of course. Of course.
PANGOL: That Doctor has been interfering with the Generator again. I want them all found.
BROCK: Mena is dying.
PANGOL: The life of an individual is trivial.
BROCK: You might at least try Hardin's idea.
PANGOL: With Mena's death, the future arrives. The Children of the Generator will rise to claim their inheritance.
ROMANA: Is it something to do with the random field frame?
DOCTOR: I wish I knew what you wanted, friend.
DOCTOR: Of course. Come on, let's go then. Come on.
ROMANA: Where to?
DOCTOR: Back to the boardroom. Our scaly friend's seen someone he wants to talk to.
HARDIN: But can we trust him?
DOCTOR: Well, you can trust me, that's the important thing.
PANGOL: When the dawn comes, Mena will be dead. The birth of the new Argolis must be recorded by history. I shall need one alien witness.
BROCK: So that's why you're telling me all this.
PANGOL: The Doctor! Seize him!
DOCTOR: Oh no, I've got a surprise for you all.
BROCK: No, no. Don't you touch me! No! No, don't touch me. Stay away from me! No, don't touch me! Argh!
Part Four
FOAMASI: Now that I have your attention and this traitor's voice synthesiser, I must explain. I am the Foamasi government.
DOCTOR: Mmm, it looks genuine to me.
PANGOL: These people are enemies.
FOAMASI: Those two are the enemy. A saboteur and a murderer.
PANGOL: They were the cause of all these accidents?
FOAMASI: With assorted colleagues, they've been systematically trying to run this planet down.
MENA: But Brock
FOAMASI: The real Brock never left Earth.
MENA: I don't understand.
FOAMASI: Since our last government clamp-down, the West Lodge has been looking for a new venue for its illegal activities. Argolis would have been ideal.
MENA: They should have known we'd never sell.
FOAMASI: Their business methods are very persuasive. This one is the leader of all sectors. With him under arrest, the West Lodge is wound up. You're going back to face trial.
FOAMASI: The filaments will hold them until we board our shuttle.
PANGOL: We can't let these aliens go.
MENA: Why not?
PANGOL: Don't you understand? They've been spying on our planet.
MENA: The government agents mean to help.
PANGOL: An excuse to infiltrate.
MENA: I'm not persuaded, Pangol.
PANGOL: Then I must persuade you.
MENA: Must?
PANGOL: Yes. There are new imperatives.
MENA: Let me past. It is my duty to escort them to their shuttle.
PANGOL: Then I relieve you of that duty.
MENA: Let me pass immediately. That is an order.
PANGOL: No!
FOAMASI: I'm glad this has ended so satisfactorily.
DOCTOR: If it has ended.
FOAMASI: With the arrest of those two, peace is restored.
ROMANA: What the Doctor means is
DOCTOR: Don't cross your bridges before they're hatched.
PANGOL: Wait! The Argolin dawn. The dawn of the new Argolis. No one can now be permitted to leave. You are destined by history to remain and watch.
FOAMASI: I am an ambassador. To interdict my departure would be an act of war.
PANGOL: You won't leave here alive.
ROMANA: Come on. We'd better do something quickly.
ROMANA: The random field frame.
HARDIN: It's probably back in the Generator by now.
ROMANA: Then Pangol's ready to proceed.
HARDIN: Yes. If Pangol's replaced the random field frame, we'll still be getting surges.
ROMANA: I can't see any way round that, can you, Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR: Please get on with it. There's so little time.
HARDIN: Now, if we had a second random field frame.
DOCTOR: The Tardis.
ROMANA: Not the Randomiser.
DOCTOR: Perfect. What a stabilising matrix.
ROMANA: It's too risky. How long would it take us to build one?
HARDIN: I must work out some new eigen functions.
ROMANA: Right, I'll modify the oscillator.
MENA: No! No, that is a sacred symbol.
PANGOL: A symbol of our shame. The Helmet of Theron is a call for revenge.
MENA: Theron worshipped the flame of war.
PANGOL: A flame that welded Argolis into a single nation.
MENA: And brought us death.
PANGOL: And he will be avenged. We, Pangol, the child of the Generator, will fulfil his dreams of great conquests.
MENA: How? With what army?
PANGOL: We are the army.
MENA: You've perfected it?
The Doctor starts to enter the Generator room, sees Vargos at the control console and backs out again. Vargos turns as the door closes, and sees nothing.)
PANGOL: Guides of Argolis. According to our ancient laws, we, Pangol, declare ourselves your new leader.
PANGOL: We are the future, guides of Argolis, for what is about to happen and for the eons that lie beyond, you will grant us your unquestioning obedience.
PANGOL : Citizens of the old Argolis.
HARDIN: Mena's dead.
PANGOL : Your appointed tasks in the Experiential Grid are hereby concluded.
PANGOL: All guides to the Recreation Generator. Citizens of the old Argolis, today your lives will be irrevocably changed and the Hive itself transformed as we equip ourselves for the rebirth of this great planet.
HARDIN: We, Pangol? What does he mean?
ROMANA: I think it's more than just a figure of speech.
HARDIN: If only we could have saved Mena.
ROMANA: It's not too late. Look.
ROMANA: Hardin!
HARDIN: I've got to get up there.
ROMANA: You'll get caught. Doctor, tell him. Where is he?
ROMANA: He's heading for the Generator. He's mad! He's going to try to fit the Randomiser himself.
VARGOS: The Foamasi shuttle is requesting permission to take off, sir.
PANGOL: Denied.
VARGOS: Their request has diplomatic priority, sir.
PANGOL: Denied!
PANGOL: The Foamasi will return to the Hive to witness the fulfillment of Argolin destiny.
DOCTOR: The anti-baryon shield. Anti-baryon shield. Anti-baryon shield. Now, where was it, exactly?
PANGOL: Citizens of Argolis, the time has come!
VARGOS: Sir, we have another urgent request from the Foamasi shuttle for clearance.
PANGOL: The Foamasi request clearance. Let they try taking off. I'll clear them into time and space!
ROMANA: Stop! Stop! You mustn't start the Generator.
PANGOL: Another defiant alien. Nothing can stop us now.
ROMANA: But the Doctor's in there!
PANGOL: Begin the programme.
TANNOY: Attention. This is the launch systems controller. The Foamasi shuttle has launched.
PANGOL: Well, blow it into space!
ROMANA: That is an act of war!
PANGOL: War is the destiny of the new Argolis.
ROMANA: The Foamasi shuttle. He's mad! You've got to stop him. You've got to stop him. He's mad!
ROMANA: Stop him! Stop him!
ROMANA: Oh no. An army of Pangols.
ROMANA: Stop this. The Doctor's in there.
PANGOL: Remove that alien trash. Let her rot outside.
ROMANA: Let me go! The Doctor's in there. Let me go! Let me go!
PANGOL: Continue the programme.
HARDIN: Mena?
PANGOL : Fetch the body of the Chairman. That too can be disposed of outside.
ROMANA: Stop! Let me go! Let me go! The Doctor's in there! Let me go!
ROMANA: What are you doing?
ROMANA: Doctor!
PANGOL: No. No. No. No.
DOCTOR: It's terribly simple. It's a tachyon image. Outwardly Pangol, inwardly me. Unfortunately, these tachyon images are very unstable.
DOCTOR 2: Or fortunately, depending on your point of view.
HARDIN: The Generator.
ROMANA: Then where's the Doctor?
ROMANA: Thank heavens. At least you're solid enough.
DOCTOR: Come on, we've got work to do.
ROMANA: Please.
DOCTOR: Shush, careful.
ROMANA: You're the last one.
DOCTOR: The first one, actually.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: The first one out of the Generator.
ROMANA: Then you're real?
DOCTOR: It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel real enough. Yes, it's holding up quite well so far.
DOCTOR: That's me nearly complete. Where's my coat?
ROMANA: Here. I think I see. The images must have been multiplied in a sort of FIFO stack.
DOCTOR: FIFO stack? Yes, I see what you mean. First in, first out. Where's my hat? Thank you.
ROMANA: Which would make you the original.
DOCTOR: Well, I had concluded that empirically, but it's nice to have some theoretical background.
ROMANA: I've just remembered.
DOCTOR: What? Mena! Come on, quick.
PANGOL: We shall begin again!
HARDIN: Out of my way.
PANGOL: Dispose of her outside.
HARDIN: Out of my way!
PANGOL: Outside! I order you! She's dead! I am in command!
HARDIN: She's stopped breathing. The Generator is her only chance.
PANGOL: No, I must be leader! The Argolin need me. A new army can still be built. We can change the Generator. I must be leader!
ROMANA: Look!
DOCTOR: I think I set it on rejuvenation.
ROMANA: What? Anything could happen. It's totally unstable.
HARDIN: It's useless. The doors won't open while it's running.
DOCTOR: It's too late. They've written out the override.
ROMANA: It's too dangerous!
MENA: This time I must try to bring him up properly, but there's work to do first. We must contact the Foamasi and avert this war.
FOAMASI: You mentioned Foamasi?
MENA: But your shuttle.
FOAMASI: The West Lodge leader who impersonated Brock must have tried to take off without us.
DOCTOR: So Brock and Klout are kaput, little Pangol.
MENA: I'm so sorry. Naturally, we'll replace your vehicle.
FOAMASI: Later. You and I have a lot to discuss, Madam Chairman.
MENA: Forgive me, but I didn't quite catch your name.
MENA: Ah, of course. Well, let's continue this discussion in the boardroom.
DOCTOR: Hardin!
HARDIN: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Have a baby.
DOCTOR: I think we're redundant here. Let's go.
ROMANA: The Randomiser.
DOCTOR: What about it?
ROMANA: Well, we can't just leave it here.
DOCTOR: Why not? I don't like not knowing where we're going to turn up next.
ROMANA: Neither does the Black Guardian. That is the point of the thing. The Black Guardian's a real threat.
DOCTOR: Some galactic hobo with ideas above his station. The cosmos is full of them. Anyway, there's been enough randomising on this job.
ROMANA: Job? It was meant to be a holiday.
DOCTOR: Well then, I'm going to be very glad to get back to work. And I'm missing K9.
