Frontios
Part One
BRAZEN: The answer's buried here somewhere. The Captain will find it.
BRAZEN: Get out, everybody! Come on, move. Captain Revere!
BRAZEN: Block and tackle! Quickly!
BRAZEN: I want no mention of this to anyone. Do you hear me? Not to anyone!
TEGAN: The Doctor's all right. He gets like this sometimes. Nothing to worry about.
TURLOUGH: Well, I suppose it's none of my business. I think he must be coming.
DOCTOR: Not hat people, are you? Either of you?
TEGAN: What?
DOCTOR: Wear them much, I mean. I only do when I go out. It's silly to have this thing getting in everyone's way.
TEGAN: I don't believe it.
TEGAN: There's so much to do aboard this ship and all you're worried about is tidying away the hat stand.
DOCTOR: Well, I have to start somewhere.
TURLOUGH: Doctor? Something's happening to the controls.
DOCTOR: Ah, we must be on the outer limits. The Tardis has drifted too far into the future. We'll just slip into hover mode for a while.
TEGAN: We're in the Veruna system, wherever that is.
DOCTOR: I had no idea we were so far out. Veruna. That's irony for you.
TEGAN: What is?
DOCTOR: Veruna is where one of the last surviving groups of mankind took shelter in the great er. Yes. Well, I suppose you've got all that to look forward to, haven't you.
TEGAN: In the great what, Doctor?
DOCTOR: All civilisations have their ups and downs.
TURLOUGH:  Fleeing from the imminence of a catastrophic collision with the sun, a group of refugees from the doomed planet Earth
DOCTOR: Yes, that's enough, Turlough.
TEGAN: You mean some of the last humans are on this planet?
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEGAN: Can we land? Can we visit them?
DOCTOR: Laws of time.
TEGAN: Since when has that ever stopped you?
DOCTOR: Now, we mustn't interfere. Colony's too new, one generation at the most. The future hangs in the balance. Now, I've got another one of these somewhere. Put them side by side, we'll have a pair.
RANGE: There is enough distrust already of the long path back to knowledge. An enquiry into Captain Revere's death is vital.
BRAZEN: I said, there's no requirement for an investigation. A distillation vessel exploded here in the research room.
RANGE: And that's your childish reason for closing down the whole of the research room?
BRAZEN: Captain Revere was quite specific. The research centre was to be closed down in the event of his dying. I've nothing else to say on the matter.
RANGE: You're throwing away forty years work. Don't you care?
BRAZEN: Simply obeying orders.
RANGE: Look, we lost all our technology when our ship crashed here. Now don't you think our struggle has been hard enough without this added foolishness?
BRAZEN: The only foolishness that I know is to disobey an order. Right, enough of that, Cockerill.
RANGE: What, you're abandoning the communications scan too?
BRAZEN: Everything.
COCKERILL: Forty years and nothing's come through on that set. I don't think it's any great loss.
BRAZEN: Nobody asked for your opinion on the matter. Get back to corridor duties.
RANGE: On whose authority?
BRAZEN: Plantagenet himself.
RANGE: Oh, the boy's distraught.
BRAZEN: Are you suggesting that the son of Captain Revere is unfit to rule?
RANGE: Look, as Chief Science Officer
BRAZEN: Oh, don't go waving your title at me. From now on this research centre is under military jurisdiction.
RANGE: But the research into the bombardment. Now you must see the urgency of that?
RANGE: Look, the attacks are coming almost daily.
BRAZEN: There'll be no more talk about this in front of our people, Mister Range. The desertion rate is already unacceptable. Now, with or without your permission, this research room will be sealed.
TEGAN: I can't believe it.
TURLOUGH: It would be interesting to go down, wouldn't it. Er, Doctor, we were
DOCTOR: Impossible. Time's up.
TEGAN: What happens to them, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Knowledge has its limits. Ours reaches this far and no further.
DOCTOR: Stabilisers are failing. Have to get out of here.
TURLOUGH: It's a meteorite storm.
DOCTOR: The Tardis should be able to resist this sort of thing. The console's jammed!
TURLOUGH: We're being dragged towards the planet!
TEGAN: How?
DOCTOR: Gravitational pull?
TEGAN: Doctor, do something.
DOCTOR: Don't panic.
DOCTOR: My least favourite sort of weather.
DOCTOR: Come along.
TEGAN: This way.
TEGAN: In here. Over here.
DOCTOR: It's all right.
RANGE: We shall need the emergency supplies.
DOCTOR: Leave it to me.
RANGE: Oh, thank you, sir.
DOCTOR: I shall need some antiseptic and bandages.
RANGE: Antiseptic.
DOCTOR: To clean this wound.
RANGE: Look, I'm the Chief Science Officer. Who are you?
DOCTOR: It would help if we could see what we're doing.
DOCTOR: Phosphor lamps.
TURLOUGH: These are a terrible fire hazard in this sort of container, you know.
DOCTOR: Better hold it steady then, hadn't you.
TEGAN: How does it work?
TURLOUGH: Well, it's electron excitation. If you give them a shake, they get a bit brighter.
DOCTOR: Stop that, would you? Is this the best you can do?
RANGE: Yes, I'm afraid it is.
DOCTOR: We need some proper lighting. Turlough, the Tardis. I'll need the portable mu-field activator.
TURLOUGH: Doctor, you did say
DOCTOR: And five of the argon discharge globes.
DOCTOR: Oh, and all medical supplies.
TURLOUGH: Anything else?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'd better give him a hand, Tegan.
TEGAN: Right-o, Doctor.
RANGE: This is my daughter, Norna. And you
DOCTOR: Time for social niceties later. Better get started, hmm?
NORNA: Yes, well, you'll want soap and water first.
DOCTOR: Yes, good idea.
TEGAN: This door's locked!
TURLOUGH: No, it isn't. This could be serious.
RANGE: It's very good of you to help us, Mister, er
DOCTOR: I'm not helping, officially. And if anyone happens to ask whether I made any material difference to the welfare of this planet, you can tell them I came and went like a summer cloud.
RANGE: They're curious to know who you are.
DOCTOR: Perhaps you could ask them to move. They're rather blocking the air. It's interesting. How often do you have meteorite showers?
RANGE: Intermittently. Although the attacks have become more frequent over the last few weeks.
DOCTOR: Yes. The attacks?
RANGE: Oh yes. We're at war.
DOCTOR: Really? With whom?
RANGE: Well, that has yet to be determined. As you can see, we're helpless.
DOCTOR: Not if I have anything to do with it. How do you do? I'm the Doctor.
RANGE: Oh, hello. My name is Range. I'm the Chief
DOCTOR: Hello. You've been keeping us unnecessarily in the dark, Mister Range. You didn't tell me you had a hydrazine steam generator.
BRAZEN: There's a development, sir, which I am not happy with.
PLANTAGENET: Development? Yes?
BRAZEN: An arrival, simultaneous to the last bombardment. Three persons of undetermined origin.
PLANTAGENET: So, it's come at last.
BRAZEN: Yes. This could be the beginning of the invasion.
DOCTOR: It's very interesting.
RANGE: It used to generate a basic form of energy, but we no longer have any fuel. This planet is without wood or any combustible material.
DOCTOR: What about the colony ship? Must have been brimming with gadgetry.
RANGE: Oh, systems that could rebuild a civilisation for us. Failure-proof technology.
DOCTOR: What happened to it all?
RANGE: It failed. And nothing survived the crash.
TEGAN: Doctor! Doctor, something's happened to the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
TEGAN: The interior door's jammed.
TURLOUGH: As if some tremendous forcefield's pulled it out of shape.
TEGAN: It couldn't be the impact of landing, could it?
DOCTOR: The Tardis? No, no, no. Probably just some spatial anomaly. You're getting carried away again, Turlough. One thing at a time. Where's the mu-field activator?
TURLOUGH: I'm trying to tell you. It's behind
DOCTOR: It's behind the interior door. Yes, of course. Excitation.
TURLOUGH: You told me not to do that.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's risky, but then so is operating in this gloom. Have you ever tried putting a higher voltage across one of these things?
TEGAN: Doctor, the Tardis!
DOCTOR: Yes. There must be something on this planet capable of sustaining a steady voltage.
TURLOUGH: How can you work, do research, without electricity?
NORNA: Well, we used to use an acid jar charged by wind power.
TEGAN: Acid jar?
NORNA: A sort of large battery.
TURLOUGH: That's a thought. With some sort of interrupter to raise the voltage.
NORNA: It's in the research room, but I'll need some help carrying it.
TEGAN: Okay, come on.
TURLOUGH: We seem to have lost our news value.
TEGAN: There's a counter attraction. Look.
NORNA: Food's rationed on Frontios. It's why the colony ship's guarded. We'll have to be careful, the ship's out of bounds.
TURLOUGH: It sounds dangerous.
NORNA: Do you mind?
TURLOUGH: No, it isn't that, it's just that I wouldn't want us to get
NORNA: Quick, hide.
BRAZEN: Stand straight, sir. They look to you.
PLANTAGENET: Norna? You're needed in the hospital, surely.
NORNA: I've come to ask for more bandages and water.
BRAZEN: Do you think we have unlimited supplies?
NORNA: You have supplies. What's the use of hoarding them? Leader Plantagenet, the wounded need your help.
PLANTAGENET: Make sure this woman has access to the medical supplies room.
ORDERLY: Yes, sir.
NORNA: Come on.
BRAZEN: Orderly, are you responsible for this noise?
ORDERLY: No, sir.
BRAZEN: Somebody is.
TEGAN: It's huge.
NORNA: It brought thousands of people from Earth, remember.
TEGAN: Thousands?
NORNA: Well, the crash killed most of them and then there was an outbreak of disease. Someone's coming.
RANGE: Well, Captain Revere assumed that the barrage was some sort of softening up process. Heralding an invasion, he said.
DOCTOR: Hmm, someone else thinks this is their territory.
RANGE: Frontios was quite deserted when we arrived.
DOCTOR: So you did nothing to provoke an attack.
RANGE: No. The few that survived the crash had no time for anything but bare survival. We worked to raise food.
DOCTOR: Dangerous, surely, out in the fields with the risk of bombardment.
RANGE: Oh, there was no bombardment then. We had ten years of clear skies to stock the wreck of the colony ship with food, and then it began. Yes, the first missile a little over thirty years ago.
DOCTOR: Thirty years? Your unknown invaders are certainly taking their time.
PLANTAGENET: Unknown no longer, perhaps. Could it be that one of them calls himself the Doctor?
NORNA: They've sealed the room!
TURLOUGH: Now what?
TEGAN: We go back?
NORNA: No, there's another way in. This way.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not really here at all, officially. And as soon as I've helped Mister Range with arrangements, I'll be on my way.
PLANTAGENET: Do you feel free to come and go as you please?
DOCTOR: Going, yes, coming, no. We were forced down.
PLANTAGENET: I see. You landed during the bombardment and yet you appear unharmed.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, we didn't know there was a war on. At first we thought it was some sort of meteorite storm.
PLANTAGENET: And what do you think now?
DOCTOR: I think your shelters are totally inadequate and your warning system does nothing but create panic.
PLANTAGENET: I did not ask
DOCTOR: Your population has already fallen below critical value required for guaranteed growth and you're regularly losing new lives. I think, and you did ask what I think, I think your colony of Earth people is in grave danger of extinction.
NORNA: Be quiet. They can hear us walking on the hull of the ship.
PLANTAGENET: Who are you to give me advice! I am the son of Captain Revere. The people of Frontios will not be cowed by these mewling words of defeat, Doctor. We may lack the outward appurtenances of might, but we carry our strength within us. We will win the war with the invisible aggressors whose missiles batter on our planet, and we will win the greater battle, the struggle for the future of our race.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I wish you all the luck in the world. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to give you anything much in the way of help.
PLANTAGENET: We're under no illusions about that, Doctor. We can see for ourselves the results of your help.
RANGE: The Doctor has helped. He's been caring for the sick, and he's going to arrange for some proper light by getting that thing
PLANTAGENET: The hydrazine engine! This invader has interfered with the great gift my father bestowed upon the people of Frontios.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I was working out a way of getting some decent light in here.
PLANTAGENET: We people of Frontios are vulnerable, Doctor. Desperate, frightened even. But we are not fools.
TEGAN: They're coming.
TURLOUGH: Come on.
BRAZEN: Check the solar drive panels. They've got to be hiding somewhere.
TEGAN: It smells lethal.
NORNA: It is.
TURLOUGH: So please don't spill it.
BRAZEN: Guard the hatch. I'll inform the leader.
TURLOUGH: Be careful.
TEGAN: Turlough!
COCKERILL: I got it, but only just.
TEGAN: How are we going to get past them?
TURLOUGH: I'll think of something.
TEGAN: Are you sure this is going to work?
TURLOUGH: Have you got a better idea?
BRAZEN: Ah, Warnsman.
WARNSMAN: Sir?
BRAZEN: I don't like the look of this sky.
WARNSMAN: No, sir.
BRAZEN: Keep good watch.
WARNSMAN: Very good, sir.
PLANTAGENET: No craft the size of yours is capable of traversing the universe.
DOCTOR: If I had a spare millennium I might bring you up to date on time mechanics. Unfortunately, we have this lighting problem and a ward full of people needing medical attention.
RANGE: Another bombardment.
DOCTOR: What, again?
RANGE: There's the darkening of the sky. Oh, it's all right, the Warnsman will sound his klaxon at the first sign.
PLANTAGENET: You came with two accomplices. They have been seen on the colony ship, aided by your treacherous daughter.
ORDERLY: Hey, you're not allowed up there.
TURLOUGH: Look out!
RANGE: Paranoia. Your minds are being eaten away by the scale of the disaster we call Frontios. Can't you see this man is here to help us?
PLANTAGENET: I say treachery, Mister Range. Are you guilty too?
DOCTOR: You know, we can sort all this out in no time at all if everyone just stays calm. Now please, come and see the Tardis. As an invasion weapon it's about as offensive as a chicken vol au vent.
TURLOUGH: The bombardment's started again.
NORNA: We've got to get him back to the medical centre.
TURLOUGH: Come on.
DOCTOR: It's lack of armaments can be an embarrassment at times. Just a minute. Get back!
BRAZEN: Don't be alarmed. We haven't heard from the Warnsman yet.
DOCTOR: Oh, well, this way.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, what have we here?
PLANTAGENET: It's the Warnsman.
BRAZEN: Take him to the medical shelter.
DOCTOR: Now, what's this?
NORNA: The battery for the lighting.
DOCTOR: Brilliant! Take it inside. Hurry along.
DOCTOR: Now, where's the mu-field activator?
TEGAN: We told you, Doctor. We couldn't get any further than the console room.
TURLOUGH: Doctor, can't we continue this conversation under cover?
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed, in the Tardis.
BRAZEN: This bombardment could be a tactical diversion on the part of the Doctor.
PLANTAGENET: No, I think not, Brazen, but he has some connection with these attacks.
NORNA: Careful.
RANGE: Gentle with that now, gentle. Over there.
DOCTOR: A swift exit, I think. We've had enough of this planet.
BRAZEN: Are you hurt?
TEGAN: It's getting lighter.
DOCTOR: The attack's nearly over. Let's get out of here. Come on, the Tardis.
TEGAN: The Tardis, what's happened?
TURLOUGH: It's gone!
DOCTOR: The Tardis has been destroyed.
Part Two
TEGAN: The Tardis can't just disintegrate.
TURLOUGH: I'm afraid it has.
DOCTOR: Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation.
BRAZEN: Best to despatch him now.
NORNA: Wait!
PLANTAGENET: Get out of the way.
DOCTOR: Be careful, Norna.
NORNA: Why did Captain Revere dedicate the whole of his life to analysing the rocks of Frontios?
BRAZEN: Remove her!
PLANTAGENET: No, wait. Why do you ask when the reason is well known? My father sought the precious minerals beneath the soils.
NORNA: What precious minerals? Did he find any?
PLANTAGENET: He knew there must be some reason for the perpetual carnage our neighbours inflict upon us.
NORNA: Well, if the Doctor is an invader, he has the answer to that question.
RANGE: Oh, Norna, I need some help with the lighting.
PLANTAGENET: No, wait.  You go.
TEGAN: I don't know anything about lighting.
BRAZEN: Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Best do as they say. We'll be safe as long as we remain calm. Now trust me.
PLANTAGENET: Well, Doctor. Can you enlighten us as to the reason for these bombardments?
DOCTOR: In time, if you let me investigate. If, on the other hand, you're going to kill me, you'd better get on with it.
PLANTAGENET: Kill him.
NORNA: No!
DOCTOR: This wasn't what I had in mind at all.
NORNA: What was that?
DOCTOR: Oh, just residual energy from the Tardis.
PLANTAGENET: What is it?
BRAZEN: The thing that brings down the bombardment.
RANGE: That's enough.
TEGAN: That battery'd better work after all our efforts.
RANGE: It's in good condition. We just have to hook it up.
TEGAN: The Doctor is safe, isn't he?
RANGE: For the time being, though death is a daily occurrence on this planet, as you can see. The constant state of panic and the growing number of Rets.
TEGAN: Rets?
RANGE: Retrogrades. It's what we call the deserters. More of them leave every week to hunt out in the wastes like animals.
TEGAN: Orderlies shoot deserters?
RANGE: If they have to. Oh yes, it's a waste of life, but discipline is paramount.
TEGAN: But every death increases the danger of extinction!
RANGE: Do you think I'm not aware of that?
MAN: Water.
TEGAN: Water. He needs some water.
PLANTAGENET: Now at last the colonists of Frontios are face to face with their persecutors. For my father's sake, Doctor, I should like that question answered.
DOCTOR: What, the precious rocks under the soil business? Well, so would I. Whatever's going on here has put paid to my Tardis.
PLANTAGENET: You deny you're at war with us?
DOCTOR: If it is war, and I'm not so sure about that, then you and I, Plantagenet, are in the same shell hole. Now, does anyone know where these are coming from?
NORNA: Well, we know it's one of the other planets in the Veruna system.
PLANTAGENET: Without instruments, it's impossible to tell which one.
DOCTOR: This rock analysis. You've been investigating the whyfors. I think you should be looking into the where froms. Mister Range tells me you have a research room.
BRAZEN: The research room was sealed up, by the orders of the late Captain Revere.
DOCTOR: Well, if you want answers, you'd better unseal it.
PLANTAGENET: There's nothing in that room that could possibly be of any use to us.
TURLOUGH: That's not true. It's full of invaluable equipment.
DOCTOR: You've been inside it?
TURLOUGH: It's where we found the battery.
DOCTOR: The trouble is, if these good people don't want us inside.
TURLOUGH: Yes, Doctor. I think I know how to change their minds.
PLANTAGENET: Order the research room to be opened.
RANGE: Thank you. You can get back to your work now.
TEGAN: It's no good, is it.
RANGE: I'm afraid not.
TURLOUGH: Hurry up!
DOCTOR: Yes, er, careful with that thing.
DOCTOR: Well, here we are then. This should keep us busy.
DOCTOR: Turlough, you can help.
TURLOUGH: Er, I don't know a lot about chemical tests.
NORNA: I do.
DOCTOR: Good, good. I want to run a series on halides and silica. And do stop waving that thing around.
NORNA: Look out!
TURLOUGH: I wouldn't. What did I do?
DOCTOR: I think this joke's gone far enough.
WOMAN: Mister Range!
TEGAN: Deaths unaccountable?
TEGAN: Rabbits.
DOCTOR: Medical centre, quickly!
BRAZEN: So, he was hit.
DOCTOR: Delayed effect of a glancing blow.
DOCTOR: Now, I want you to stay here and start those tests.
RANGE: What do you think you're doing?
TEGAN: I'm, I'm trying to get the drawer open, if you really want to know.
RANGE: Curiosity is dangerous on Frontios.
TEGAN: Not as dangerous as ignorance.
RANGE: What do you know? What have you seen?
TEGAN: Deaths unaccountable.
RANGE: You must forget that you saw that.
TEGAN: There's something going on here, isn't there. Some racket you're into.
DOCTOR: Tegan! Ah. Those wires.
TEGAN: What about them?
DOCTOR: Rip them down.
TEGAN: I've only just put them up.
DOCTOR: Jolly good. Now you can rip them down again. Damp cloths. Anything damp.
BRAZEN: This way. Over here.
TURLOUGH: I wouldn't put up with it.
NORNA: We have to. We don't have the technology to go anywhere else.
TURLOUGH: Yes, I'm beginning to know the feeling.
BRAZEN: What's the matter with him?
DOCTOR: Fibrillating.
TEGAN: What?
RANGE: It's his heart. The Doctor's going to get it going again.
DOCTOR: Are we ready?
RANGE: Ready.
DOCTOR: Now!
TURLOUGH: Why didn't you dig deep bunkers? The Arardjacks of Heiradi hollowed out a huge subterranean city under their planet during the Twenty Aeon War.
NORNA: There was a quarry where the stone came from to build the medical shelter. We converted that into a place to get away from the bombardment.
TURLOUGH: Sounds very sensible.
NORNA: We always used to go there to shelter. Then all that got stopped.
TURLOUGH: Why?
NORNA: Captain Revere made a law against it.
TURLOUGH: Oh, as simple as that. He made a law.
NORNA: Forbidding any digging under the ground.
TURLOUGH: Surely there must have been a reason?
NORNA: Captain Revere never gave reasons. Except once. When I was very small, I was sitting on his knee in the state room, and I asked him why we couldn't go underground anymore. And he said. It was a child's answer, it seemed quite sensible at the time.
TURLOUGH: What did he say?
NORNA: He said the earth was hungry.
DOCTOR: Again!
TURLOUGH: There.
NORNA: That's not a pressure filter.
TURLOUGH: Oh, sorry. I was just wondering. These rocks.
NORNA: What about them?
TURLOUGH: Well, they're all labelled with dates. They must have come from somewhere.
NORNA: They did. The quarry.
TURLOUGH: Yes, but some of the dates are recent. You told me that quarry had been closed for years.
BRAZEN: You've killed him.
DOCTOR: I admit it was touch and go for a minute.
NORNA: What are you up to?
TURLOUGH: Well, they obviously didn't install this just for us.
NORNA: It's for lifting equipment.
TURLOUGH: What equipment? What's so heavy in here that needs a block and tackle?
DOCTOR: Try to get some rest.
PLANTAGENET: Rest. Death is the only kind of rest you bring to Frontios.
BRAZEN: Don't exert yourself, Leader. We have everything under control.
PLANTAGENET: I have responsibilities. Frontios depends upon me.
BRAZEN: Nevertheless, I should take the Doctor's advice.
PLANTAGENET: You've changed your mind about him too?
BRAZEN: I wouldn't commit myself on that, however it was the Doctor that saved your life.
TEGAN: The Doctor's all right. You must have realised that by now.
PLANTAGENET: You saved my life? Is this true?
DOCTOR: Not a word to the Time Lords.
NORNA: Very ingenious.
TURLOUGH: No, not really. The block and tackle is a simple enough invention.
NORNA: I mean you and your excuses to get out of helping.
TURLOUGH: How long ago were you in the Research room?
NORNA: When I was very small. I came with my father when he was still Captain Revere's personal science assistant.
TURLOUGH: And was that up there then?
NORNA: No.
TURLOUGH: Exactly. These floor plate are solid metal. Heavy, solid metal. Norna, come here. We are about to find out where Captain Revere got his rock collection. That hook goes in here.
PLANTAGENET: So you see, Doctor, Frontios is not the easiest planet to rule.
DOCTOR: After thirty years of bombardments, yes, I take your point.
TEGAN: Your friend Brazen doesn't trust us an inch.
PLANTAGENET: Ah, he's a good man, if a little narrow in his outlook.
TEGAN: He's planning to move you to your quarters in the colony ship.
PLANTAGENET: The colony ship? No, I must stay here with my people.
DOCTOR: The democratic touch, eh?
PLANTAGENET: Hardly democracy, Doctor. I must remain in public sight. If the people of Frontios think for one moment that I am dead, there will be anarchy.
NORNA: Come on, pull.
TURLOUGH: What do you think I'm doing?
NORNA: I wonder what's down there?
TURLOUGH: Let's take a look.
DOCTOR: Now, what's making you so vulnerable to attack is the thin atmosphere on Frontios.
PLANTAGENET: Why do they come so frequently now?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have some theories about that, and with your permission I'll return to the Research room and confirm them.
PLANTAGENET: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tegan.
PLANTAGENET: Your assistant may stay here with me. That way we'll all trust one another.
DOCTOR: Then perhaps you'll come with me, Mister Range.
RANGE: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Good. See you later.
BRAZEN: Keep an eye on them.
TURLOUGH: Careful. Come down slowly. This rock, it's sort of moth-eaten.
NORNA: Hey, look. There's a way through. Don't tell me you're frightened.
TURLOUGH: No, it's just like something I remember.
DOCTOR: You know, Mister Range, if I'm right these so-called missiles of yours are nothing more or less than natural meteorites.
RANGE: Meteorites? In such quantities?
DOCTOR: Oh, it's unusual, I grant you, but one of the planets in the Veruna system may have disintegrated with long term fall out.
RANGE: Surely Captain Revere could have detected that?
DOCTOR: I think he did.
BRAZEN: He'll fill out, find his strength. I saw his father grow the same. The odds were terribly against us, you know, but he held this colony together with a will of steel.
TEGAN: I'm beginning to understand the problems of this planet, what with all the deaths accountable and unaccountable.
BRAZEN: What do you know about deaths unaccountable?
TEGAN: Just a phrase I heard.
BRAZEN: Heard where?
TEGAN: I don't know. I just heard it somewhere.
BRAZEN: Or in some records.
TEGAN: You know about the data store then.
BRAZEN: Data store, eh? Right, show me.
TEGAN: Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I just came across it in a book somewhere.
TEGAN: It sounds like a title. Deaths Unaccountable. You can't do that to Mister Range's records!
DOCTOR: What puzzles me is how it managed to crash in the first place with all that autonomous guidance on board.
RANGE: The systems failed.
DOCTOR: What, before the crash?
RANGE: Yes. Without the failure, there would have been no crash. The guidance systems, everything, all went together.
DOCTOR: Did they now. I see why you call it the day of catastrophe.
RANGE: They've gone! Exploring, by the look of it.
DOCTOR: Ah, the rock analysis. They look like Widmanstaatten patterns to me, which would seem to confirm that
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
RANGE: I'm afraid they may be in danger down there.
DOCTOR: Turlough wouldn't risk an unsafe tunnel.
RANGE: No, not that. I've suspected for a long time that Captain Revere ordered the quarry closed because of something he found.
DOCTOR: What sort of something?
RANGE: A geological feature, perhaps. Something beneath the surface it might be dangerous to disturb.
BRAZEN: So, it's Mister Range who's been spreading these rumours.
TEGAN: What rumours?
BRAZEN: Disinformation about the status quo.  You, keep an eye on things down here.
PLANTAGENET: Help. Help!
TEGAN: Plantagenet!
NORNA: Bring the light here a minute. The walls are quite different here.
TURLOUGH: It's smooth, like glass. Perhaps we ought to go back.
NORNA: In a minute. I want to see where this leads to.
RANGE: Are you sure, Doctor? I want to help.
DOCTOR: You will, Mister Range, by staying here. These sort of adventures depend on a well-manned home base.
TURLOUGH: Can we go back now? Please?
NORNA: Oh, come on, chicken.
TURLOUGH: I'm not frightened! I'm just thinking.
NORNA: I'll leave you to it, then. I'm going on.
TURLOUGH: No, wait, I'm coming.
TEGAN: It's true. As if something was sucking him through the floor. I must get the Doctor.
BRAZEN: I don't think so. We're going to need you here.
BRAZEN: What's the meaning of this crass behaviour? Cockerill, what's going on?
COCKERILL: I'm trying to control the crowd, sir. There's unrest about the leader.
BRAZEN: You're an Orderly, aren't you? So keep order! That's the meaning of the word. Go on, out.
COCKERILL: They think Plantagenet's dead.
BRAZEN: Come on!
BRAZEN: You've come to show them that he's alive, I suppose, eh? What do you think this is, waxworks museum? Some right Retrograde material amongst you lot. Go on, get back to your business. Let Plantagenet and myself get back with ours.
RANGE: Doctor, are you there?
DOCTOR: I thought you were supposed to be guarding the rear.
RANGE: It's my daughter, Doctor. I can't let you take all the risk.
DOCTOR: Oh well, a risk shared is a risk doubled. Come along.
ORDERLY: Hey!
BRAZEN: Now, now. We'll have none of that activity here.
BRAZEN: Quickly, stop her. She's getting away!
TEGAN: The looting's started already.
NORNA: Look, come on. Stop daydreaming.
TURLOUGH: It's more like a nightmare.
NORNA: What is?
TURLOUGH: I keep glimpsing something out of the corner of my eye.
NORNA: Yes, they're funny, these reflections.
TURLOUGH: And there's a word that goes with it. Tractators. That's it.
NORNA: Oh, come on. Just a little bit further.
TURLOUGH: Tractators. Tractators.
TEGAN: Doctor?
TEGAN: Doctor? Is there anybody down there?
DOCTOR: Shush.
RANGE: I can't hear anything.
DOCTOR: Listen.
TURLOUGH : Argh!
RANGE: I heard that.
DOCTOR: Turlough, Turlough.
TURLOUGH: Tractators. I've seen them!
DOCTOR: Mister Range, look after Turlough. I'm going on alone.
BRAZEN : Get this door open.
TEGAN: So here you are. Is he all right?
RANGE: Yes, I think so.
TEGAN: What happened?
RANGE: I don't know. The Doctor's gone to investigate.
TEGAN: You take care of him. The Doctor'll probably need some help.
RANGE: No, wait!
RANGE: What happened in there? Please tell me. Is my daughter safe?
DOCTOR: So they're Tractators.
DOCTOR: No, Tegan, get back!
Part Three
TEGAN: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Get her out of here. I'll hold them off.
TEGAN: But
DOCTOR: Out!
BRAZEN: All right, listen you lot. The Retrograde element is out in strength. Emergency discipline procedures apply from this moment on. Desertion, looting and insubordination will suffer the highest penalty. Right, first we find the Doctor.
BRAZEN: All right, you lot. You've got one minute to clear this area!
RANGE: Norna! Oh, thank goodness you're safe. Where's the Doctor?
TEGAN: I'm going back for him.
NORNA: No, it's too dangerous.
TEGAN: We can't leave him there.
RANGE: You stay here with Turlough. I'm coming with you.
TEGAN: No, thanks all the same, but the Doctor's my responsibility.
RANGE: No!
RANGE: It's foolish to go into those tunnels alone.
RANGE: Look after the boy. I won't be long.
NORNA: No!
DOCTOR: Oh, no. On the other hand, with a touch of spin.
DOCTOR: How's that?
TEGAN: Don't tell me you're lost, Doctor. Because if you are, so am I.
DOCTOR: Ah, the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.
DOCTOR: It's like walking through treacle.
TEGAN: Hold on, Doctor, I'll give you a hand.
DOCTOR: No, stay back!
TEGAN: It's all right, Doctor, I've got you. What's happening?
DOCTOR: Some sort of gravity beam from the Tractators.
DOCTOR: No, no, stay back. Get everyone back to the research room!
TEGAN: Why don't you do something?
DOCTOR: Oh, I am. Lots of things. Nothing that quite fits the gravity of the situation.
TURLOUGH: My home. Tractators. I've seen all this before.
RANGE: Quick, we must get him to the surface and get help.
NORNA: He's speaking, father. I think it's important.
TURLOUGH: They were there, waiting. Destroying us from inside.
NORNA: Sounds like something coming up from his past, like a memory picture.
TURLOUGH: Once, long ago, on my home.
NORNA: You remember them?
TURLOUGH: We remember them! The people of my planet will never forget!
RANGE: It's more than his past. It sounds like deep ancestral memory.
TURLOUGH: Tractators! Once, long ago, my home was. An infection!
DOCTOR: Give me that.
TEGAN: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Wait until we're closer.
BRAZEN: You, Cockerill? This is looting. Anything to say?
COCKERILL: What? It's all over, can't you see that?
BRAZEN: For you, yes.
COCKERILL: For Frontios. Plantagenet's been eaten by the earth.
BRAZEN: Is that what they're saying?
DOCTOR: Hold on. Now!
DOCTOR: Better get out of here.
COCKERILL: The line of leadership is destroyed, and now it's every man for himself.
BRAZEN: Where'd you glean all this information?
COCKERILL: It's common knowledge.
BRAZEN: Common knowledge? You sound like a Retrograde.
COCKERILL: We're all Rets now, Brazen.
BRAZEN: Take him away.
RANGE: Steady, young man. Not much further to go.
NORNA: Wait a minute, father.
NORNA: It's a map.
RANGE: That's Captain Revere's writing.
NORNA: Then that proves it. He must have known about the caves and tunnels. RANGE: And more than that, perhaps.
NORNA: You don't suppose he knew about the creatures?
RANGE: Well, he must have suspected something if he was down this far.
NORNA: Well, why not tell the people of Frontios?
RANGE: The conspiracy of silence. I've been collecting evidence all these years
NORNA: You don't think they're connected, the unaccountable deaths and these creatures?
RANGE: There is a connection. That girl Tegan told me she saw. Come on, we must hurry.
TURLOUGH: The earth is hungry. It waits to eat.
NORNA: He's forcing himself to remember.
TURLOUGH: I can see them. They are the appetite beneath the ground.
COCKERILL: You're letting me go?
BRAZEN: I don't need you.
COCKERILL: This colony is finished, and everyone knows it except for those who are too stupid to think for themselves.
BRAZEN: You've got enough food there to last a few days. What then?
COCKERILL: I don't know.
BRAZEN: It's not easy to live inside the system, but to live outside of it takes more than you've got.
BRAZEN: Leave him be. He's made his choice.
RANGE: We must get help.
NORNA: This may be the help we need, father. It's here that he remembers best. You can see them under the ground? What are they doing?
TURLOUGH: Growing. Breeding. Spreading the infection.
NORNA: How do they do that?
TURLOUGH: I can't see it. There's a wall.
RANGE: An emotional block. Something he doesn't want to face.
NORNA: Try to get through the wall.
TURLOUGH: Black walls. Smooth. They shine like glass.
NORNA: You can see through glass. Look through it.
TURLOUGH: No! It's evil! I can't look!
RANGE: Right, that's enough. We must get him out of here.
BRAZEN: Ah, Mister Range. We've been waiting for you. I've a file here. It's contents amount to a charge of sedition. Bring them along to the State Room.
COCKERILL: Help me! Please, someone, help me.
COCKERILL: Help me!
TEGAN: If only we knew more about these creatures.
DOCTOR: I suspect Turlough can help us with that, as soon as we get back
DOCTOR: Get back.
TEGAN: I heard you the first time.
DOCTOR: Against the wall. There are more of them.
TEGAN: What's it doing?
DOCTOR: There's someone up there it wants to get down.
COCKERILL: Help me! Help me!
DOCTOR: I'm going to try an experiment.
TEGAN: Too late, it's seen us.
MAN: He outlived the hunger of the earth. A man who can do that can do anything!
DEPUTY: Do I understand then, Mister Range, that you admit to keeping private and secret medical records?
RANGE: I'm the Chief Science Officer.
DEPUTY: Of course. And these records purport in part to contain a history of mysterious disappearances?
RANGE: The records are accurate. Ever since our first arrival on this planet there have been cases
DEPUTY: We all know the myths going about the place, Mister Range. No need to elaborate them here.
RANGE: But are they myths? That's the point.
BRAZEN: Address the Deputy, Mister Range. It's the facts we're after, not a public debate.
RANGE: But these are the facts. Bodies of the dead that have not been recovered, work personnel in the quarry unaccounted for. I even have one reliable eyewitness account of a corpse disappearing into the earth.
DEPUTY: Quite, but for some reason you chose to keep these happenings secret.
RANGE: No, the State made them a secret. I merely collected the records.
BRAZEN: I'm a plain speaking man, Mister Range. You've been collecting this garbage in order to subvert law and order on Frontios, haven't you? Now admit it.
RANGE: Plantagenet accuses me of that?
DEPUTY: That is correct.
RANGE: Then where is he? I know why he isn't here. The Doctor's friend told me what she saw in the medical shelter. Frontios buries its own dead. That's what they say, isn't it?
DEPUTY: So runs the myth.
RANGE: She saw that myth. She saw Plantagenet being eaten by the earth.
TURLOUGH: Eaten by the earth.
DEPUTY: He has some contribution to offer?
TURLOUGH: They live in the ground below, pulling us to them in our times of weakness.
DEPUTY: Please, we have work to do
TURLOUGH: Dead or alive, their forces dug at our bodies.
BRAZEN: What do you know about this?
NORNA: Leave him alone.
RANGE: He's in shock. He needs warmth and rest.
BRAZEN: And I need answers, Mister Range.  Wait outside, you two.
BRAZEN: Off the record, I think. They, you say. Who are they?
RANGE: I warn you as a medical man, he's in no state to be questioned.
BRAZEN: And you're out of order, Mister Range. If there's a grain of truth in this story of yours, then these are important matters of State. Do you expect me to delay the investigation just because this young man is feeling delicate? Your name's Turlough, eh? Well now, Turlough, I want to hear all about this.
TEGAN: We've got to find the way out.
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes it's easier to look for the way in and then work backwards.
TEGAN: Oh, come on Doctor, all these tunnels look the same.
DOCTOR: Oh, but they aren't.
DOCTOR: What do you make of these?
TEGAN: Just loose chippings.
DOCTOR: Hmm. These chippings have recently been machined from these walls.
TEGAN: They have machines?
DOCTOR: Functionally advanced ones, at that. They're creating an extensive and elaborate tunnel system. Oh, insect-like they may be, but they're no ordinary insects. They have highly refined powers of abstract reasoning. These Tractators must be very intelligent beings indeed.
GRAVIS: It is time we fetched this Doctor to us. Send the machine.
BRAZEN: Organised, intelligent. Huh, not much of an enemy profile. What I want to know is what they are about and why.
NORNA: Please, he's in a state of shock.
RANGE: When deep ancestral memory pictures break through the conscious mind like this, dangerous instabilities are created. Now, leave the boy alone, If anybody is on trial here, it's me.
BRAZEN: Not a trial, Mister Range, a pooling of information. Something we should've done decades ago.
RANGE: When you had the chance.
BRAZEN: No. Because you had all the information locked up. If you'd shown us that, then Captain Revere, who with his bare hands held this shambles we called Frontios together, might still be alive.
NORNA: Captain Revere knew about the creatures. He must have done. It's his fault. Why didn't he tell us? BRAZEN: And add to the rumours and unrest? You can't broadcast socially sensitive information unless you're in control of the facts.
NORNA: But if we'd known for sure
BRAZEN: We'd have done what? These Tractators that the boy talks about, they could explain the unspeakable events that we have witnessed.
RANGE: Not witnessed, Brazen, if we're being particular about this. You and I have not actually seen it happen.
BRAZEN: I have, Mister Range. Come with me. I want to show you something.
DOCTOR: You're never without a sense of direction while there's an air flow. Air flows from A to B. Usually you want to be at B. Or at A.
TEGAN: I don't want to be at A or B, thank you very much. I just want to be out of these tunnels and back in the
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I think you can forget about the Tardis. It's probably scattered in little pieces across the whole of Frontios. Yes.
BRAZEN: There. You see?
RANGE: But the State funeral? We all saw the body.
NORNA: But not the face.
BRAZEN: Carcasses are plentiful on Frontios. There had to be a corpse, just to keep public order.
NORNA: It was here he disappeared?
BRAZEN: Sucked into the earth in front of my eyes. He was badly injured by the falling boulders and rubble, but he would've lived.
TURLOUGH: He may still be alive.
BRAZEN: Alive?
NORNA: What do you mean?
TURLOUGH: The Tractators need living flesh. They need minds as well as bodies.
GRAVIS: The work of excavation is our task. Beneath the soil we can expand and populate the whole of Frontios. Do you understand? It is important that you understand. Speak.
PLANTAGENET: We will defeat your goal.
GRAVIS: You do not know our goals. I have described our means. Once we have full control of Frontios, our plans are only just beginning.
PLANTAGENET: You are evil. We will fight you to the last.
GRAVIS: This is not a war, Plantagenet. It is a cooperation. You will see.
PLANTAGENET: The colonists of Frontios will never cooperate with you.
GRAVIS: And yet they do. We Tractators have devised an economical technology of excavation, but it needs a captive human mind to drive it.
PLANTAGENET: Captives? Slaves?
GRAVIS: You will see. You will see. Our old driver is nearing the end of his useful powers, but now we have another to take his place. Do we not, Plantagenet?
BRAZEN: I want a strategic force of five hand picked men equipped for a below-ground sortie. We'll have the briefing in here within the quarter hour.
DEPUTY: Very good, Chief Orderly.
DOCTOR: Wait. That's the sound.
TEGAN: What is it?
DOCTOR: The machine that did this.
DOCTOR: It seems to be coming this way.
BRAZEN: That weapon's no good for tunnel work, Jensen. Oh, and I'll take the rations. We are going to be privileged to sit down and eat with Plantagenet on our return.
NORNA: You didn't let anybody down.
TURLOUGH: It doesn't matter. It's not my sort of thing, anyway, mooching around in caves and tunnels underground.
RANGE: No, not Turlough.
BRAZEN: We need someone who knows the terrain.
RANGE: His mental state won't be reliable beneath ground. I'll come with you.
BRAZEN: I'd prefer you to stay here with your daughter. The Rets are on the rampage. Things could get nasty outside, too.
NORNA: I don't need looking after.
BRAZEN: All right, Mister Range, I'll accept your offer.
NORNA: Bye, father.
DOCTOR: Tractators dead ahead.
TEGAN: This is ridiculous, running about like rabbits in a hole. If you ask me
DOCTOR: No one is, Tegan, so shush.
NORNA: Don't torture yourself. Nobody expects you to go back down there.
TURLOUGH: No, of course they don't. I'm Turlough.
NORNA: What's this?
TURLOUGH: Decision time.
TURLOUGH: That's it then. I'm going.
NORNA: No, don't be silly.
TURLOUGH: You can't argue with fate. Here. It's a two corpira piece. You blow through it for good luck.
NORNA: Wait a minute.
DOCTOR: Excavating machine or Tractators. Take your pick.
TEGAN: After you.
DOCTOR: It's a bit of a problem this, Tegan.
TEGAN: That's horrible. It's a corpse.
DOCTOR: Not exactly. There's a living mind enslaved in the middle of that lot.
TEGAN: That face. I recognise it from somewhere.
DOCTOR: It's Captain Revere.
Part Four
GRAVIS: Two specimens have come down to us from the world above in an undamaged state. This is a rare pleasure.
DOCTOR: How do you do. I'm the Doctor. Oh. Er, this is Tegan.
GRAVIS: We know you, Doctor, at least by reputation.
DOCTOR: Then perhaps you won't mind telling us who you are.
GRAVIS: I am the Gravis.
NORNA: Help!
GRAVIS: This is our centre of operations. You see, Doctor, I do not fear you will take this information back to Gallifrey. You will never leave Frontios now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, you could be right, Gravis.
TEGAN: Considering the state of the Tardis.
GRAVIS: Tardis? You have a Tardis?
TEGAN: Not any more.
DOCTOR: Ah, not any more than any other Time Lord. You like travel?
GRAVIS: Only those who have been isolated for millennia truly appreciate the power of mobility. Yes I should like to see your Tardis.
GRAVIS: We have been marooned out here on Frontios for nearly five hundred years, as I'm sure the Time Lords already know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd better put you right on one thing, Gravis. The Time Lords didn't send me to investigate. Gallifrey operates a policy of strict non-intervention these days. And besides, Frontios is completely outside our normal sphere of influence.
TEGAN: You're practically telling him to carry on as is.
DOCTOR: We mustn't take the narrow viewpoint, Tegan. After all, Gravis and his friends were here long before the Earth colonists.
TEGAN: You can't side with them. They built the excavating machine.
DOCTOR: Slight communications problem here, Gravis. My assistant hasn't been programmed in the ways of the world. Please forgive the naivety.
NORNA: But Cockerill, you're an Orderly.
COCKERILL: Retired from active duty.
TEGAN: Doctor, you can't let them do this to me.
DOCTOR: I'm terribly embarrassed about all this.
GRAVIS: Not at all, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It must be the humidity causing the malfunction. These serving machines are perfectly reliable on Gallifrey.
GRAVIS: The guard Tractator here will restrain it while I show you more of our work here. It is certainly a very convincing replica of the humanoid life form.
DOCTOR: Oh, you think so? I got it cheap because the walk's not quite right. And then there's the accent, of course. But, when it's working well, it's very reliable. Keeping track of appointments, financial planning, word processing, that sort of thing.
COCKERILL: Leave it. There's time enough for that when we've taken the ship.
NORNA: Listen to me. This isn't the way to do it. Please, stop him, somebody!
NORNA: Why is he doing this? 
RETROGRADE: Look, the earth began to suck him down and then returned him. Cockerill's the man to save this planet.
COCKERILL: All clear. Ready?
NORNA: No, you don't understand.
COCKERILL: Keep her quiet.
GRAVIS: Once mind functions are extinct the entity is no longer useful as a motive force.
DOCTOR: Yes, he seems dead enough.
GRAVIS: A waste, but we had the best of him. You can watch us fit the replacement.
BRAZEN: Come on, Mister Range. I've got five good men dependent on you.
RANGE: I'm lost. I don't know the way.
BRAZEN: I'm sure we can pick up the trail again. I'll trust your judgement.
RANGE: Let's rest for a while, hmm?
BRAZEN: Better for morale if we keep on the move, eh? We can take it slowly. Quiet. There's someone coming.
BRAZEN: Turlough.
RANGE: But you're supposed to be with Norna. You've left her alone!
TURLOUGH: I thought you might need me.
RANGE: Well, what about Norna?
BRAZEN: We do need you, to show us the way.
RANGE: I'm going back. Someone should be with her.
TURLOUGH: No it's too dangerous!
BRAZEN: Leave him be. He's not the man for the job. You show us.
GRAVIS: We will now demonstrate how the drive mechanism is installed.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, if I could just inspect the linkages.
PLANTAGENET: Why, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh! Yes, it's very efficient, Gravis. You certainly know your mechanics.
DOCTOR: No shortage of spare parts either, eh?
GRAVIS: Not on Frontios.
PLANTAGENET: If it weren't for the bombardment
DOCTOR: Oh, but it is for the bombardment, isn't it, Gravis? No accident that.
GRAVIS: The existence of a heavy asteroid belt in the Veruna system was fortuitous, but the rest, Doctor, has been our gravitational engineering.
DOCTOR: You know, I guessed as much. Useful asteroid belt up there, some additional gravity beams down here, and you're knocking them over like ninepins.
PLANTAGENET: I curse the unhappy chance that brought us to this planet.
DOCTOR: Oh, not chance, eh, Gravis?
GRAVIS: You're right, Doctor. Our skill steered the ship here.
PLANTAGENET: You?
DOCTOR: Their gravity beams again. Which explains why the colony ship's systems failed before the crash.
PLANTAGENET: But at the beginning there was no bombardment.
DOCTOR: Oh, they gave you ten years to establish yourselves, and then they started making their collection.
RANGE: No. No!
GRAVIS: We are almost ready, Doctor. I shall demonstrate the final adjustment.
DOCTOR:  I'm here to help you.
PLANTAGENET: I don't believe you.
DOCTOR:  You'll have to trust me. When the time comes, do exactly as I say.
PLANTAGENET: Yes, but when will the time come?
GRAVIS : Doctor!
DOCTOR: I was rather wondering that myself.
BRAZEN: Get down.
TURLOUGH: It's seen me. It knows I'm here! Help! Help!
TURLOUGH: It's tearing me apart!
TEGAN: Idiot! The Doctor had a plan. You've ruined it now!
TURLOUGH: Save the bickering until we're out of here!
TEGAN: He's probably in great danger. Mister Brazen! The Doctor needs your help! This way!
GRAVIS: Let us show you how we smooth our walls, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've been wondering why you need such a fine polish. More of your gravitational engineering, I suspect.
GRAVIS: You're getting ahead of yourself, Doctor. We will have to know one another much better before I can discuss that stage of our plans.
DOCTOR: Do you know I think I can guess, Gravis. The tunnels act as wave guides. You're concentrating your gravitational forces.
GRAVIS: Possibly.
DOCTOR: Why? The combined power would be astronomical.
GRAVIS: Yes. When the tunnel system is complete, and the work is nearly done.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, stay back.
DOCTOR: Please, there are far too many of them.
BRAZEN: How do we get him out of this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, theoretically it's highly complex. Practically
GRAVIS: No, Doctor! I forbid you to touch the machine!
TEGAN: What's happening to them?
BRAZEN: Is he dead?
DOCTOR: No, no, just stunned. We'll have to work quickly.
DOCTOR: Careful!
DOCTOR: Quick! Come on, you two! We're getting out of here.
TEGAN: Turlough! Turlough!
DOCTOR: Get off, Turlough! Pull yourself together!
DOCTOR: Brazen!
TEGAN: Doctor, the Gravis!
BRAZEN: Get out of here, sir, while there's time!
DOCTOR: Give me your hand!
BRAZEN: Go! That's an order.
COCKERILL: Look, men, this is the beginning of a new Frontios. I never wanted to be a second Plantagenet, but it seems there's no choice.
NORNA: We won't need a second Plantagenet.
COCKERILL: What do you mean?
NORNA: He's still alive. Chief Orderly Brazen and my father have gone to rescue him.
RETROGRADE: What, down there?
COCKERILL: I don't believe you.
RANGE: It's no good. Tractators everywhere. Frontios is doomed!
TURLOUGH: Doctor, I remember everything. I must tell you!
DOCTOR: Yes, all in good time, Turlough.
TURLOUGH: I know what they are.
PLANTAGENET: And I know what they're trying to do.
DOCTOR: Well, that sounds promising. Put the two things together, we may find a way of stopping them.
TEGAN: The excavating machine, it's going berserk.
DOCTOR: I think it's time we left. Come on.
GRAVIS: My machine! My machine! We will find you, Doctor. You will pay dearly for this disruption to our plans.
TEGAN: No sign of them.
DOCTOR: Well, these aren't Tractator tunnels. We should be safe here for a while. Keep watch that end.
DOCTOR: Now, what do we know about these creatures?
PLANTAGENET: The tunnel system is a gigantic ring, smooth and mathematically precise.
DOCTOR: Yes they're building a gravity motor.
TEGAN: A motor?
TURLOUGH: That's what they do to planets. They're going to drive Frontios.
DOCTOR: Hmm, steer it through the galaxy under the power of gravity.
TURLOUGH: To steal and plunder wherever they go.
DOCTOR: And breed. Infesting new planets. Nowhere in the universe will be safe from them.
TEGAN: But if their excavating machine is wrecked, they can't complete the ring.
PLANTAGENET: They have another. All they need is a driver.
TURLOUGH: And anyone of us will do for that.
TEGAN: That's the Orderly.
DOCTOR: No, no, Tegan, it's too late! Follow me.
TEGAN: The Tardis! Bits of it anyway. Doctor, look what I've found!
TEGAN: Oh no, not you again.
GRAVIS: Perhaps I have been deceived. I think we have found our new driver.
DOCTOR: Glad you could join us.
TEGAN: Doctor! There you are.
DOCTOR: Turlough, Plantagenet and I have been working out a plan.
TEGAN: Well, it had better work because they're right outside.
DOCTOR: Oh, I rather hoped they would be.
PLANTAGENET: Turlough has remembered the secret of the Tractators.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Apparently they're not really dangerous.
TURLOUGH: It's the Gravis they draw their strength from. Without him, they're harmless burrowing earth creatures.
TEGAN: They certainly fooled me.
TURLOUGH: So, all we have to do is find a way of isolating the Gravis from the others.
TEGAN: That should be fun. He's not trying to take off, surely?
TURLOUGH: Unfortunately not.
TURLOUGH: None of the controls are functional.
TEGAN: You mean, it just looks pretty.
PLANTAGENET: That's the idea.
DOCTOR: Well, that's it. Now, this should either sort out this whole Tractator problem and repair the Tardis.
TEGAN: Or?
DOCTOR: Or it won't. I suggest you all get under cover.
GRAVIS : It is useless to hide!
GRAVIS: We have you completely in our control now.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. I'd, er, I'd like to negotiate a surrender.
GRAVIS: There is nothing to negotiate.
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. You can have it all. Frontios, its unhappy occupants, the lot. I don't think it's fair for us Time Lords to interfere.
GRAVIS: You admit you were sent?
DOCTOR: Why should we let a bunch of stuffed shirts deprive you of your own form of transportation? Hmm? However primitive.
GRAVIS: Primitive?
DOCTOR: Well, in comparison to Gallifreyan time technology, of course. But then, what isn't?
GRAVIS: The, the Tardis!
DOCTOR: What, this? Oh, yes, well, as I was saying, you can have Frontios, all the fixtures and fittings appertaining thereunto, and I'll pull my Tardis together and get off your patch.
GRAVIS: I should like to see it, this Tardis.
DOCTOR: Well, it's not all here at the moment, you understand. It's, er it's been spatially distributed to optimise the, er, the packing efficiency of, er, the real time envelope.
GRAVIS: The power of travel is beautiful, Doctor. Very beautiful.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, indeed. Well, as you can see, from this panel, Gravis, I control all of the main Tardis functions. The time coordinates, spatial coordinates, all inoperative at the moment, of course, because the spatial distribution circuits are switched in.
DOCTOR: Ah. Now, you really will have to be more careful, Gravis. Now the autoscan's picking up all the locations of the concealed Tardis components. Oh, well, not to worry. I shouldn't think it's even within your powers to reassemble them. Besides, what would you want with an old Type Forty Time and Relative Dimension in Space machine, hmm?
GRAVIS: But I do want it, Doctor. The Tardis. Infinite travel within my grasp.
DOCTOR: Oh. No, Gravis, please. Take everything else but leave me the Tardis.
GRAVIS: I will have it.
DOCTOR: Oh no, Gravis, please, I beg you! Spare me the Tardis!
GRAVIS: I will have it!
TURLOUGH:  What's he doing, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Shush. This isn't the time to disturb his concentration.
PLANTAGENET: Doctor, what have you done?
DOCTOR: Brace yourselves.
NORNA: What was that?
RANGE: The end. The end of Frontios.
NORNA: Or the beginning, Father.
TEGAN: The Tardis can't stand this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's kill or cure.
TEGAN: The TARDIS is coming together!
TURLOUGH: That's impossible.
DOCTOR: For you and me, maybe, but when the Gravis really wants something.
TURLOUGH: The Tardis will be repaired?
DOCTOR: With a bit of luck, any moment the plasmic outer walls of the Tardis will seal.
TURLOUGH: We'll be in our own dimension.
DOCTOR: If your theory is correct, Turlough, the vital link between the Gravis and his Tractator chums. Hold on!
PLANTAGENET: Is he dead?
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, but quite harmless, and as long as we keep him isolated from the other Tractators, he'll stay that way.
TEGAN: We can't go dragging around the universe with a dormant Gravis on the console.
DOCTOR: Well, the first thing we'll do is drop him off on some uninhabited planet.
PLANTAGENET: Brave man, this Doctor, travelling with the Gravis on board.
RANGE: Oh, it's quite harmless now. I inspected the creature myself.
TURLOUGH: Now all we need is a console room to go round it.
RANGE: Well the Doctor and Tegan are due back any minute.
TURLOUGH: He's got a present for you.
PLANTAGENET: A present? But it is enough that he has given us our freedom.
RANGE: Yes, no more terror descending from the sky.
TURLOUGH: Not unless you count the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Well, that's that. The Gravis is safe and well on the uninhabited planet of Kolkokron, exercising his animal magnetism on the rocks and boulders.
TEGAN: There's nothing but rocks and boulders out there. All the planets are deserted according to the Tardis scanner.
RANGE: Well, that's better than being among enemies, as we thought.
PLANTAGENET: So, the last of mankind is after all quite alone.
DOCTOR: Alone but in good hands, Plantagenet. Speaking of which, I know it's not much, but, a farewell token.
PLANTAGENET: Frontios is honoured, Doctor. But surely you'll stay a while longer and enjoy some of the new colony we're building?
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. Far too much repair work of my own to be done. Besides, time and the time laws don't permit it. There's an etiquette about these things which we've rather overlooked, I'm afraid.
RANGE: But Doctor, you've done so much for us.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Don't mention it.
NORNA: After all he's done, he just says don't mention it?
TEGAN: He means it, literally.
TURLOUGH: Don't mention it to anyone.
DOCTOR: Now listen, you two. If the Time Lords ever hear about our little trip to Frontios, there'll be serious trouble.
TURLOUGH: What would have happened if we hadn't been there, Doctor?
TEGAN: Well, the Tardis engines would be working properly, for one thing.
DOCTOR: Oh, there's nothing wrong with them.
TEGAN: Then why are they making that funny noise?
TURLOUGH: We're going far too fast, Doctor. Stop the engines!
DOCTOR: No, no, no, leave them. They're all right.
TURLOUGH: What's happening?
TEGAN: The Gravis?
DOCTOR: Oh no, this is something much more powerful. We're being pulled towards the middle of the universe. I'm trying to pull against it.
TEGAN: Against what?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I think we're about to find out.
