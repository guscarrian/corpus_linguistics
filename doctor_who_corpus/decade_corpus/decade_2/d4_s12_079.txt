Revenge of the Cybermen
Part One
SARAH: Thank heavens for that! We've made it. Haven't we?
DOCTOR: Of course we've made it. Did you think we wouldn't?
SARAH: Well, in these past few weeks, yes.
DOCTOR: There's really nothing that can go wrong with a Time Ring, except a molecular short circuit.
SARAH: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
SARAH: The Tardis isn't here.
DOCTOR: Well, it probably hasn't arrived yet. We're a little early.
HARRY: Hasn't arrived yet?
DOCTOR: No. You see, the Tardis is drifting back through time, Harry. We just have to wait for it to turn up.
HARRY: I say, Doctor, do you want this Ring thing?
DOCTOR: What, that?
HARRY: Yes.
DOCTOR: No.
HARRY: Oh, well, I'd rather like to have it.
DOCTOR: Well, you take good care of it, Harry.
HARRY: Of course I will. Thank you.
HARRY: You knew that was going to happen, didn't you.
HARRY: He's dead. Been dead some time.
DOCTOR: How long?
HARRY: A week or two, I'd say. There's very little sign of putrefaction, though.
DOCTOR: Sterile atmosphere.
HARRY: Yes, exactly. And no sign of injury. Nothing to indicate the cause of death.
SARAH: But he was just sitting against the door as though he'd collapsed.
DOCTOR: He wouldn't have been left there for two weeks unless
SARAH: Unless what?
DOCTOR: Unless there was something seriously wrong here. Come on.
WARNER: This is Nerva Beacon calling Pluto Earth flight One Five. This is Nerva Beacon calling Pluto Earth flight One Five. Pluto Earth flight One Five, are you reading me?
COLVILLE : Hello Nerva Beacon, we read you fives clear. Our dropover tango oscar alpha estimated at 13.20.
WARNER: Pluto Earth flight One Five, next notice urgent. This beacon is a quarantined zone. We have a plague infection. I repeat, we have a plague infection. Your dropover is transferred to Ganymede Beacon 19067 on zero 2. Do you require a repeat on those vectors?
COLVILLE : No thanks, Nerva. We got them. How bad are things there?
WARNER: They're pretty bad.
COLVILLE : Hello, Nerva, Crewmaster Colville, I say again, Crewmaster Colville is doing a tour with you. He's my brother. Is he all right?
WARNER: Hold, Pan-Tec. I'll check.
WARNER : Commander Stevenson?
LESTER: Warner wants to speak with you, sir.
STEVENSON: Yes, Warner?
WARNER: Sir, I'm in contact with the Pluto Earth flight. One of the crew wants news of his brother, Crewmaster Colville. What shall I tell him?
STEVENSON : Tell him Colville's fine, and say that our medical staff have got the epidemic under control.
STEVENSON: Just that, and nothing else. Thank you, Warner.
KELLMAN: Why don't you tell them the truth, Commander?
STEVENSON: I'm just following the orders I was given by Earth Centre.
KELLMAN: Operating the Beacon to the last man?
STEVENSON: If necessary, yes. You're a civilian, Kellman. You wouldn't understand.
KELLMAN: How much longer can you go on? Three of you doing the work of fifty men.
LESTER: We've managed for one week, we can manage for another.
KELLMAN: And another after that? No, Lester, this beacon's job is finished.
STEVENSON: Nerva Beacon has a thirty year assignment, and it'll be that long before the last inward bound ship has this new asteroid on its star chart.
LESTER: Until then, there's a constant danger of space collision.
KELLMAN: You deserve a medal for self-sacrifice beyond the bounds of stupidity.
STEVENSON: I've lost most of my crew in these last months, some good friends among them, and yet a thing like that is still alive.
LESTER: It's probably because he locked himself in that cabin of his at the first sign of the plague.
LESTER: It's only these last few days he's dared poke his nose outside.
SARAH: Is it jammed?
DOCTOR: The control's locked.
HARRY: You mean we can't get any further?
DOCTOR: Those poor fellows couldn't. They were trapped in the after end and left to die. Whatever did it might be on the other side of this door. There might be a way of opening it.
SARAH: Look, are you sure we're in the right place, Doctor? I mean, this doesn't look like our Ark.
DOCTOR: Well of course it doesn't. This is a different point in time.
SARAH: How can you tell?
DOCTOR: Some of that equipment. This is probably a beacon, put in orbit to service and guide space freighters.
HARRY: So this is before the time of the solar flares, when the Earth was evacuated.
DOCTOR: Thousands of years before, Harry.
SARAH: Oh, I'm not even going to think about it. I'll only get a headache.
DOCTOR: All you have to remember is that this is where we parted company with the Tardis.
SARAH: What is it?
DOCTOR: If they've changed things round, the Tardis might materialise in the forward control rooms.
: Can anyone hear me? I'm calling Nerva Beacon.
WARNER: This is Nerva Beacon. I repeat, this is Nerva Beacon. Hello, are you reading me? This is Nerva Beacon.
ALIEN: Does anybody hear me? Can anyone hear me? Can anyone hear
WARNER : This is Nerva Beacon calling on 398.
WARNER: Do you read me?
WARNER: Professor, this new asteroid, this rock or whatever it is, are you sure there's no life on it?
KELLMAN: On Voga? Of course not, how could there be?
WARNER: I don't know, Professor, but I've just picked up a call and that's the only place it could have come from. It's the only place near enough.
KELLMAN: Hallucinations, Warner. You've been sitting here too long.
WARNER: Where did that rock come from, anyway? What system?
KELLMAN: Nobody knows. It was first detected in our system fifty years ago and it was captured by Jupiter.
WARNER: So there could be life on it.
KELLMAN: Impossible. An asteroid that size, drifting in the vacuum between star systems? Nothing could have lived under those conditions.
WARNER: All the same, I'd swear that's where the transmission was from.
KELLMAN: Warner, I'm an exographer. I've been down there. I've set up a transmat station there. I spent the last six months studying rock samples from
KELLMAN: What are you doing?
WARNER: Logging it. Unidentified call apparently from the direction of Voga.
KELLMAN: You're mad. I've said all along it was a mistake to keep this control room operating.
WARNER: Commander Stevenson's decision. Nothing to do with you, is it.
KELLMAN: Every time someone goes down that transom, there's a risk of spreading the plague.
WARNER: If the Commander says this Beacon is staying operational, it stays operational.
SARAH: Can you reach?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. If you two could put your weight on the door and stop it opening too suddenly. Don't want to lose my arm. I'm rather attached to it. It's so handy.
HARRY: Like so?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SARAH: Doctor!
SARAH: Wait, wait. Through. Quick.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
HARRY: What have I done now?
WARNER: Hello, Lester, is the Commander there?
STEVENSON : I'm here, Warner. Go ahead.
WARNER: Sir, somebody has just opened the aft transom shutter.
WARNER : I know it's impossible, but it's happened. The information's right here on the electronic register.
LESTER: Everyone in that after section had the plague, so no one can be left alive.
STEVENSON: Exactly. And the shutters were sealed. They couldn't possibly be operated from the after section.
STEVENSON: Right, come on, we'll have to check the transom.
VORUS: Take it out and bury it.
VORUS: Bury it deep. Why?
MAGRIK: Your plan frightened him, Vorus. Sometimes it frightens me.
VORUS: What, would you warn the humans? Do you feel kinship?
MAGRIK: No. No, it's simply that there are so many things which might go wrong.
VORUS: Of course. It's a big plan. But it will work. You and I together, Magrik, will make it work.
MAGRIK: Yes, but can we trust our agent?
VORUS: We can trust in his greed. Gold buys humans. And we have more gold here on Voga than in the rest of the known galaxy.
MAGRIK: But he has not communicated.
VORUS: Better he should not at this time. The Cybermen may be monitoring our radio frequencies.
MAGRIK: The mention of Cybermen fills me with dread.
VORUS: You feel fear, Magrik, because you've lived for too long in this underground darkness. When I lead our people into the light, all those ancient fears will fall away.
MAGRIK: The light. Yes, I believe you, Vorus.
STEVENSON: The rivets have been taken out.
LESTER: What, from the other side, sir? But that's impossible. They're blind-headed.
STEVENSON: They could have been loosened with a sonic vibrator.
LESTER: Well in that case Warner's right. Somebody has come through.
STEVENSON: Right, then we'll have to check every section. Come on.
SARAH: We just left here.
DOCTOR: No, this is the forward control room.
HARRY: Well, the Tardis doesn't seem to be here either, does it.
DOCTOR: No, but the Time Ring is designed with a slight safety margin. We can expect it to arrive soon.
HARRY : Doctor, do you expect me to believe that that old police box is just going to materialise out of nothing?
STEVENSON: Right, get your hands up. I said, get your hands up!
LESTER: Now, who are you? How'd you get here?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. This is Sarah Jane Smith, Harry Sullivan. We're travellers.
KELLMAN: You'd better step in here, Commander.
STEVENSON: What is it?
KELLMAN: See for yourself.
STEVENSON: Watch them.
LESTER: Follow them. Come on, move.
DOCTOR: What are you going to do?
STEVENSON: Get back, he's got the plague. This is the only way to deal with it.
DOCTOR: The man's sick. He needs treatment.
LESTER: There is no treatment. All we can try to do is stop the infection spreading.
DOCTOR: Sorry, gentlemen, I can't allow it.
STEVENSON: You can't allow it!
DOCTOR: My colleague is a doctor of medicine and I'm a doctor of many things. If we could examine
KELLMAN: Commander, I'm afraid you'll have to kill these people, too. They've brought the plague in here.
DOCTOR: Who's the homicidal maniac?
STEVENSON: You say you're doctors. Did Earth Centre send you?
DOCTOR: Yes, we're from Earth. We want to help you.
LESTER: Help us? Don't you realise you've brought the infection through from the after section?
SARAH: Oh don't be ridiculous. How could we have brought it through when he's infected and we aren't?
HARRY: Quite impossible. We've had no contact with him.
DOCTOR: I don't believe you've got the plague here, Commander.
STEVENSON: According to our own medical team, we have.
DOCTOR: Did they identify it?
LESTER: They didn't have time. They were among the first victims.
DOCTOR: Well, now you've got a new medical team. Well, Commander?
STEVENSON: All right, you can examine him.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
STEVENSON: But not here. It'll have to be done in the crew quarters. The control room must be kept operational.
KELLMAN: Oh yes, at all costs.
STEVENSON: Lester, help the doctors with him. I'll take over the console.
LESTER: Once the infection develops, they've got a few minutes to live.
SARAH: I'll help you.
DOCTOR : Have you noticed these rather strange scratches, Commander?
STEVENSON : Can't say that I have.
DOCTOR : They're all over the ship. I've seen them somewhere before, if I could only remember where.
STEVENSON : Is it important?
DOCTOR : Everything's important. Well, well, well.
STEVENSON : What is it?
DOCTOR : I've just made a third interesting discovery about your plague virus, Commander.
STEVENSON : A third?
DOCTOR : Yes. One, it scratches metal. Two, it attacks its victims so suddenly that they become unconscious before they can even raise the alarm, and three.
STEVENSON : Go on.
DOCTOR : It removes tape from radio logs. It must be a very literate and inquisitive virus.
STEVENSON : What exactly are you trying to tell me, Doctor?
DOCTOR : Whatever it is that's attacking your crew, Commander, it's certainly not a plague.
HARRY: I've never seen anything like this before. His temperature's just shooting up and up.
SARAH: Harry, I make his pulse a hundred and twenty.
LESTER: It's always the same. They just seem to burn up. Warner's lasted longer than most.
HARRY: Strong constitution.
LESTER: He's as tough as an old boot.
SARAH: How long since all this started?
LESTER: This? This is the seventy ninth day.
SARAH: And you've had no outside help?
LESTER: Earth Centre decided to isolate us.
HARRY: That's a bit ruthless, isn't it?
LESTER: Well, they reckoned it was better to lose one space crew than take the chance of carrying an extraterrestrial disease back to Earth.
DOCTOR : Who's your civilian?
STEVENSON : Professor Kellman. He's an exographer.
DOCTOR : Interesting. Planetary survey. Of what?
STEVENSON : Jupiter.
DOCTOR : I thought Jupiter had already been thoroughly studied.
STEVENSON : Yes. He's interested in its new satellite.
DOCTOR: What, do you mean there are now thirteen?
STEVENSON: Turned up fifty years ago. That's why this beacon's out here. A lot of the Great Circle freighters haven't got it on their charts yet.
DOCTOR: What's it called?
STEVENSON: New Phobos, originally, but Kellman's renamed it Voga.
DOCTOR: Voga. Of course. Has he been down there?
STEVENSON: Kellman? He set up a transmat. Why?
DOCTOR: Voga. Voga. Planet of gold. Yes, it's all coming back to me now.
STEVENSON: What's coming back to you?
DOCTOR: Cybermen. That's what we're up against, Commander. Cybermen.
STEVENSON: But surely, Doctor, Cybermen died out centuries ago.
DOCTOR: They disappeared after their attack on Voga at the end of the Cyber War. Not the same thing as dying out, Commander. They're utterly ruthless. Total machine creatures.
DOCTOR: How is he?
HARRY: I'm afraid he's had it, Doctor.
STEVENSON: You'd better take over the control room, Lester.
DOCTOR: Yes, just as I thought.
HARRY: You mean the two puncture marks?
DOCTOR: Yes, like a snake bite.
SARAH: You mean venom?
DOCTOR: He's been injected with poison.
SARAH: Poor man.
DOCTOR: If only I'd been quicker, I might have saved him.
STEVENSON: How? Is there an antidote?
DOCTOR: The matter beam disperses human molecules. That type of alien poison might be separated and rejected.
SARAH: Alien?
STEVENSON: Now where are you going?
DOCTOR: I smell a rat.
STEVENSON: You know, I sometimes wonder your friend is quite right in the head.
SARAH: If the Doctor scented a rat, Commander, he'll find one.
DOCTOR: Gold.
HARRY: Where are we going to put him, Commander?
STEVENSON: When this trouble first started, we turned part of the infrastructure into a mortuary.
LESTER: Yes, we used to leave them where they dropped.
SARAH: We saw.
MAN : Zero six twenty. The intensity of radiation caused severe distortion. When the computer dealt with all original errors it was found that the intensity was minus three.
MAN : Starcharts for outer space section four carry a two percent error factor. Solar readings should be independently taken when patrolling the area.
MAN : Comm. ops magazines which departed from the ship's cell. In the constellation of Zerus X 20, the intensity of radiation caused severe distortion. When the computer dealt with the trouble
Part Two
DOCTOR: Sarah!
DOCTOR: Don't let it bite you!
HARRY: That sounded like Sarah. What's happened?
DOCTOR: That cybermat's happened, Harry. Quick, into the transmat beam, quickly as you can. It's the only way to get the poison out of her system.
LESTER: She's got the plague.
DOCTOR: No, sir. That's your so-called plague, Commander.
STEVENSON: Is this thing still dangerous, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not any more, but there are bound to be others around.
DOCTOR: Hang on to her, Harry. You'd better travel with her.
HARRY: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: I'll set the beam for Voga. Do you know how to work the reciprocator?
HARRY: Er, yes, I've seen you do it.
DOCTOR: Off you go. No time to lose.
LESTER: Has it gone wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sabotage.
STEVENSON: Sabotage?
DOCTOR: Someone's taken the pentalium drive.
STEVENSON: But who?
DOCTOR: Who removed the tape from your radio log? Who used cybermats to murder your crew? And who's desperate to break all communication between this beacon and Voga?
STEVENSON : You mean Kellman.
DOCTOR : Exactly. Kellman. Your friendly exographer must be working for the Cybermen, Commander.
LESTER : Then what are we waiting for? Let's get him.
DOCTOR: Right, this might just work if I can adapt the monoso to a three phase output.
HARRY: Doctor, she's not going to last much longer.
DOCTOR: I know, Harry, I know!
HARRY: She's reacting just like Warner. It's happening all over again.
STEVENSON: Kellman. Kellman!
MAGRIK: You sent for me?
VORUS: The Cybermen are moving.
MAGRIK: What? It's too soon.
VORUS: Our human agent reports they will soon have taken over the beacon. We have perhaps four hours to complete the Sky Striker.
MAGRIK: But that's impossible!
VORUS: Four hours, Magrik! Or all our dreams are ended.
MAGRIK: The Sky Striker is ready, but the bomb head hasn't been tested, and then it'll take four hours to fit.
VORUS: Then we must gamble, Magrik. The bomb head will be tested when it strikes the beacon.
MAGRIK: Very well. I'll send for every available engineer, Vorus. At once.
LESTER: He's skipped.
STEVENSON: In quite a hurry, by the look of it. Come on.
STEVENSON: Lester, you take that section. I'll look round the transom.
DOCTOR: There isn't time to wire this in. I'll have to hold it in position. Ready?
HARRY: Sarah.
SARAH: Hmm? Yeah?
HARRY: It's worked, Doctor! It's worked!
SARAH: Oh, stop bawling down my ear. You've got a voice like a fog horn. Hey.
HARRY: What's the matter?
SARAH: What's going on here?
HARRY: Oh well, that's marvellous, isn't it. Here I am, trying to save your life and all you can do
SARAH: Trying to save? I remember. That thing, it jumped on my neck. Where are we?
HARRY: A place called Voga, I think. The Doctor transmatted us to get rid of the poison. I might tell you, my girl, that you were on the point of popping off. I say, look at that.
SARAH: What is it?
HARRY: It looks very much like gold. It can't be. I don't believe it. There's some more of it over here.
SARAH: Oh, Harry.
HARRY: Look. Gold.
SARAH: Don't be so silly. It can't be gold.
HARRY: Sarah, solid gold.
SARAH: Harry, stop it. Anyway, it isn't ours.
HARRY: Well, it isn't anybody's, is it, just lying scattered around here.
HARRY: I'm rich. I can buy myself out of the Navy, buy a quiet little practice in the country, solid gold stethoscope. Uh oh. That's torn it.
HARRY: All right, steady on, old chap.
SARAH: Hey!
STEVENSON: Put that gun down, Kellman.
KELLMAN: All right, Commander. Go ahead and shoot. Neither of us can miss at this range.
STEVENSON: I said, put that gun down.
KELLMAN: Oh, no.
STEVENSON: You can't get away.
KELLMAN: That's right, Commander. I'm going into my cabin. You can lock me in if you like. Just don't try to follow
STEVENSON: Well done, Lester. You walked right into it.
SARAH: Let go!
HARRY: This isn't necessary, you know. You're making a fuss about nothing at all.
SARAH: Harry, tell them.
HARRY: I'm trying to tell them but they don't seem
SARAH: Please, where are you taking us? We weren't trying to steal your gold if that's what you're thinking. Well, not really.
HARRY: Of course we weren't. We were just
DOCTOR: Voga, otherwise known as the Planet of Gold, is hated and feared by Cybermen because gold is lethal to them.
STEVENSON: How?
DOCTOR: It's the perfect non-corrodible metal. It plates their breathing apparatus and in effect suffocates them. Doesn't it, Professor. Now Sarah and Harry are down there, and without that pentalium drive I can't bring them back.
LESTER: We found this in his cabin.
DOCTOR: Yes. Keeps in touch with his masters. What have you done with the pentalium drive, Professor?
KELLMAN: I don't know what you're talking about.
LESTER: He's lying.
DOCTOR: I think he's lying.
KELLMAN: What are you doing with that?
DOCTOR: This? Oh, nothing. Why, is it important?
KELLMAN: No.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think our friend is lying to gain time.
KELLMAN: I don't know what you mean.
DOCTOR: But time for what, I wonder?
 Mag 27 n 09 R)
CYBERMAN: Computer reports heavy phobic energy discharge between the beacon and Voga.
LEADER:  That means the humans have recently used their transmat beam.
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: Time to docking?
CYBERMAN: Sixteen minutes.
LEADER: Good. Order the boarding party to the forward hatch.
SARAH: The Doctor'll be worrying about us.
HARRY: I'm worrying about us. What is this place, anyway?
SARAH: I can tell you what it isn't. It isn't uninhabited.
VORUS: So, you are from the beacon. Why have you come to Voga? Was it to escape the plague?
SARAH: Yes. Yes, that's right, the plague.
VORUS: You're lying! And now tell me the truth.
SARAH: I'm not lying. I had the plague
VORUS: When the plague had done its work there were to be four humans left alive. That was the plan.
HARRY: Plan? You mean you deliberately planned to
VORUS: You were not among the four.
SARAH: We arrived after the plague, but I was bitten and the Doctor put me in the matter beam to cure me, didn't he, Harry.
HARRY: Yes, that's right. It's the truth. And I came with her because she was dying. And we really weren't trying to steal your gold.
VORUS: So how many humans are on the beacon now? If you refuse to answer, you will suffer, and then I will ask you again, and then you will answer. Do you understand?
HARRY: Yes.
VORUS: Humans are reported to have some intelligence. When Vorus, leader of the Guardians, asks you a question, it is not wise to refuse to answer.
VORUS: Take them out and put them in confinement. I'll question them later.
VORUS: Greetings, Councillor Tyram.
TYRAM : Ah, Vorus. There are matters of importance I must discuss with you.
VORUS: Yes?
TYRAM : Not over the vision projector. Here, in the city.
VORUS: I am not aware of anything of such importance, Councillor.
TYRAM : I am, and as always, Vorus, I look forward to our meeting with the keenest pleasure, so I've sent our fastest skimmer to collect you.
STEVENSON: As a Space Service Commander, there are certain crimes where I can order immediate execution.
STEVENSON: And you have murdered forty seven members of my crew and jeopardised our mission.
KELLMAN: You're talking rubbish, Commander.
LESTER: Shooting's too good for him.
STEVENSON: So what's it going to be, Kellman?
KELLMAN: Be?
STEVENSON: Are you going to die now, or are you going to tell us where that pentalium drive is?
KELLMAN: You're not frightening me, Commander. You won't shoot.
STEVENSON: But I have every right.
KELLMAN: You can't prove a thing.
STEVENSON: No? What about that box you had? The Doctor says it controls the cybermats.
KELLMAN: And I say its an instrument for analysing mineral elements. Every exographer carries one.
LESTER: Look.
DOCTOR: Leave it. Don't shoot, Commander.
KELLMAN: Stop it! For heaven's sake, do something!
DOCTOR: After you've been bitten, Kellman, you'll have just ten seconds to remember where that pentalium drive is, if you want to live.
KELLMAN: All right, all right! It's around my neck. Take it.
DOCTOR: Splendid.
DOCTOR: Good. Now we can get Harry and Sarah back.
HARRY: Sarah, these chains are solid gold.
SARAH: Harry, will you just shut up about your rotten gold.
HARRY: Twenty four carat, by the looks of it.
SARAH: It's because of gold that we're in this mess.
HARRY: Just thinking.
SARAH: Well, don't!
HARRY: Gold's a very soft metal, isn't it, Sarah, so if we can find a decent bit of rock we might be able to file through.
SARAH: Well, we can't just sit here glittering, can we.
VORUS: You said a matter of importance, Chief Councillor.
TYRAM: Yes. I have a report that two aliens, two humans, have been seen in the upper gold mine.
VORUS: What?
TYRAM: By ancient tradition, your guards control the gold mines and the routes to the surface. If humans have set foot on Voga, it can only have been with your connivance, Vorus.
VORUS: You have no proof of this absurd allegation.
TYRAM: Nonetheless, I believe it.
TYRAM: Whatever is happening in the gold mines, Vorus, and strange stories have reached my ears, your guards have never before resorted to murder.
VORUS: It was a matter of internal discipline.
TYRAM: I know your ambitions, Vorus. I know you see Voga as a great power again, trading its gold with other planets in the galaxy.
VORUS: Why not? Why should we remain for ever underground, cowering from the memory of something that happened centuries ago?
TYRAM: Because this way, we survive. While no one suspects that Voga is inhabited, that this is the famous Planet of Gold, we remain safe.
VORUS: Safe? You have the philosophy of a cringing mouse, Tyram.
TYRAM: And you're a gambler with a mad thirst for power. That's why I no longer trust you and the Guardians. My senior Militia are taking over control of the gold mines.
VORUS: You dare to challenge the traditional authority of the Guardians?
TYRAM: To maintain security, Vorus. The Militia are moving into the gold mines at this moment.
VORUS: We shall see!
TYRAM: Your men are outnumbered, Vorus, and the troops have orders to crush any resistance. If there is any bloodshed, remember it will be on your hands.
VORUS: I shall have you removed from office for this!
SARAH: Ow! Careful!
HARRY: Sorry. It is flattening, though.
SARAH: So's my ankle.
HARRY: Yeah, I think you might be able to get your foot through now.
SARAH: Let's have a go, then.
HARRY: Come on, one more pull. It's coming.
SARAH: It hurts!
HARRY: Tibias, or rather fetlocks, like a carthorse.
SARAH: My ankles aren't thick!
HARRY: Come on. Pull.
SARAH: There!
HARRY: Well done. Now you can have a go at mine.
SARAH: Wait a minute. If I can break off one of those stalagmites, we might be able to use it as a lever.
VOGAN: Fire once over their heads.
VOGAN: Stay back! No one enters the guild room of the Guardians.
SHEPRAH: Hold your positions while I check fresh orders from Tyram.
MAGRIK: They must be kept from this section at all costs.
VORUS: If Tyram finds our Sky Striker, all our years of work will have been for nothing.
MAGRIK: I agree.
VORUS: As for the two humans from the beacon, have them killed immediately.
MAGRIK: Without further questioning?
VORUS: If they fall into Tyram's hands, he might learn too much of our plans. They have to be silenced.
MAGRIK: Very well. I'll send a detachment to deal with them.
DOCTOR: Right. Now let's see if it works.
DOCTOR: Strange.
STEVENSON: Isn't it working?
DOCTOR: Yes, full power. They must have left the receptor circle.
LESTER : Commander!
LESTER: I'm getting a signal on the radar screen.
STEVENSON: It could be an incoming ship.
LESTER: There's nothing due for another twelve days.
STEVENSON: Try to get a contact.
LESTER: This is Nerva Beacon to approaching craft. How do you read me? Over.  Nothing.
STEVENSON: It must be a spaceship. Look, it's coming directly towards us. Keep trying them, Lester.
LESTER: This is Nerva Beacon to approaching craft. Do you read me? This is Nerva Beacon. Would you kindly give your identity signal.
SARAH: Ow!
HARRY: Maimed for life.
SARAH: Honestly, I don't know why you're complaining. I got you free. What's that?
HARRY: Sounds like another of their dodgem cars.
SARAH: It's coming this way.
HARRY: Quick.
HARRY: This way.  Sorry, old girl, dead end. Back we go.
SARAH: No, we can't, Harry. Look.
SARAH: We're trapped.
SARAH: Over there!
SARAH: Harry!
HARRY: What?
SARAH: They're coming!
STEVENSON: It must be within visual range now. Try to get a scanner contact.
LESTER: There she is.
STEVENSON: I don't recognise that type.
LESTER: Never seen anything like it before.
STEVENSON: There are missile tubes in the nose cone.
LESTER: It must be an alien.
STEVENSON: This is Nerva Beacon. You are approaching Nerva Beacon.
STEVENSON: We are in quarantine by orders from Earth Centre. I repeat, we are in quarantine. Stand away.
LESTER: They're deliberately ignoring our signals, Commander. Look, they're moving into docking orbit.
STEVENSON: The fools!
HARRY: Careful. Quick.
SARAH: Oh, Harry.
HARRY: This looks like the end, Sarah.
SARAH: One thing about you, Harry. You never miss the obvious.
HARRY: Why don't they just finish us off?
SHEPRAH: Vogans of Vorus, lay down your weapons! You are surrounded!
SARAH: Now what?
TYRAM: The plague?
SHEPRAH: They seem confused. At first they spoke of this scourge as a plague, but then one of them said the humans were killed by poison.
TYRAM: I will see them myself, Sheprah. Are the Guardians resisting our Militia?
SHEPRAH: Not in the galleries. They are holding a defensive position outside the guild chambers.
TYRAM: Ha! I expected Vorus'd make the guild chambers his strong point. Let him hold that for the present.
SHEPRAH: One determined assault is all that is needed to occupy them.
TYRAM: Let me see the two human captives. If Vorus has committed treason, I might give him the chance to die in battle.
SHEPRAH: You think he is a traitor, Chancellor?
TYRAM: After the cataclysms of our ancient past, Sheprah, we've survived down here only by regarding all outsiders as hostile.
LESTER: They're docking!
DOCTOR: We've got to stop them getting in.
STEVENSON: But who?
DOCTOR : Cybermen!
DOCTOR: No good.
STEVENSON: Good grief!
CYBERMAN: All resistance overcome.
LEADER: The Beacon is ours.
KELLMAN: You haven't killed them?
LEADER: Of course not. We have neutralised them. They are necessary to our plan. What are you doing, Kellman?
KELLMAN: This is the stranger I reported. He calls himself the Doctor.
LEADER: And because of him, our plan was advanced?
KELLMAN: It had to be. He was interfering. I'd just like to know who and what he is.
TYRAM: I am Tyram, Chief Councillor of Voga.
HARRY: How do you do. I'm Harry Sullivan, and this is
SARAH: Sarah Jane Smith.
TYRAM: What's your mission here?
SARAH: Mission? We don't have any mission. We just sort of came here by accident, didn't we, Harry.
HARRY: Yes, that's right. It's nothing to do with us, really.
TYRAM: Explain.
SARAH: We'd better start at the beginning. Well, our plan was to find the Tardis
LEADER: Once our landing is detected, the Vogans will attack in force.
KELLMAN: Oh, they have only light armaments. Nothing that can affect your Cybermen.
LEADER: This is the main shaft?
KELLMAN: Yes, this is a shaft I explored for you. It runs right to the core of Voga.
LEADER: How far from the shaft entrance is the transmat receptor area?
KELLMAN: Just a matter of yards. I set the receptors as close as possible.
LEADER: Excellent, Kellman. You have done well. The humans will carry the explosives into the shaft.
DOCTOR: What's your cut, Kellman? Voga's gold?
LEADER: There will be no gold. Voga is to be utterly destroyed, and this time we shall not fail.
DOCTOR: Oh, really.
LEADER: And you, Doctor, and your two friends will help us in this task. That is why your lives have been spared.
STEVENSON: I was wondering why you hadn't killed us.
LESTER: We don't have to help them. They can't force us.
LEADER: Oh, you are mistaken.
LESTER: You'll discover who's mistaken, chum.
LEADER: The heart of Voga is almost pure gold. Gold is hostile to our function, therefore Kellman was asked to preserve three animal organisms for this purpose.
DOCTOR: Isn't it wonderful to feel needed, Commander?
LEADER: Kellman, on our approach run, we detected an operational discharge from the transmat area. Explain that.
KELLMAN: That was his doing. He beamed his two friends down to Voga. I tried to put the transmat out of action, but he managed to fix it somehow.
LEADER: And how much do these humans know?
SHEPRAH: Vorus, leader of the Guardians, I have a message.
VORUS: Stay where you are!
VORUS: Well, Sheprah?
SHEPRAH: Tyram has given fresh orders. My troops will hold their present positions and will not attack your guild chambers.
VORUS: He has shown sense. Your city scum would be badly beaten.
SHEPRAH: Unless we are provoked, Vorus. Then we shall sweep you aside.
KELLMAN: Look, I've done everything I can to help. I set up the transmat, I directed the Cybermen. You might never have found Voga if it hadn't been for me.
LEADER: That is true, and you have been promised great rewards for your assistance.
KELLMAN: That's why I must go down to Voga to make sure that nothing goes wrong with the transmat.
LEADER: Very well. But return as soon as possible. Once the detonator cycle commences, it cannot be stopped.
TYRAM: You know something, or he thinks you do, that would incriminate him.
HARRY: Incriminate him in what?
TYRAM: Some plot against the state, against me.
SARAH: But we only met Vorus for ten minutes.
TYRAM: It's something to do with the Beacon. My suspicions about Vorus are hardening into certainty. He's always had great ambition. This city we're in was once the survival chamber for our people. We've lived here ever since, unseen, and safe from further attack from the Cybermen. You know of the Cybermen?
SARAH: Well, yes, I've heard of them, but they're meant to have been wiped out ages ago.
HARRY: I remember the Doctor saying that the thing that attacked Sarah was a cybermat.
TYRAM: I wonder. Has Vorus in the madness of his vanity brought down the vengeance of the Cybermen upon us again? You'll come with me.
HARRY: Where to?
SARAH: Where are we going?
TYRAM: Hmm? Oh, to the gold mines. It's time that Vorus accounted for himself.
DOCTOR: What great rewards have you promised Kellman?
LEADER: The matter is of no interest to you.
DOCTOR: Everything's of interest to me, and Cybermen possess nothing that a human might want.
LEADER: You are incorrect.
DOCTOR: Then what is it? You've no home planet, no influence, nothing. You're just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers skulking about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship.
LEADER: You speak unwisely. We are destined to be rulers of all the cosmos.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, somehow. You tried that once and you were nearly wiped out.
LEADER: Because of Voga and its gold. If humans had not had the resources of Voga, the Cyber War would have ended in glorious triumph.
DOCTOR: It was a glorious triumph, for human ingenuity. They discovered your weakness and invented the glitter gun, and that was the end of Cybermen except as gold-plated souvenirs that people use as hat stands.
LESTER: Watch it, Doctor. I think you've riled him.
LEADER: That is why Voga must be destroyed before we begin our second campaign.
DOCTOR: Oh, there's to be a second campaign, is there?
LEADER: We have enough parts in our ship to build an entirely new Cyber Army, and this time, Doctor, it will be invincible. Cybermen function
LEADER: More efficiently than animal organisms. That is why we will rule the galaxy.
DOCTOR: Loose thinking. The trouble with Cybermen is they've got hydraulic muscles, and of course hydraulic brains to go with them.
LEADER: Put that down!
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, if I'm correct about what this contains, and should accidentally drop it.
DOCTOR: Now, I want some information from you, Cyber Leader.
DOCTOR: What's Kellman expecting to get out of all this?
LEADER: Kellman wants power. He will be ruler of this solar system when we have conquered it.
DOCTOR: Your puppet dictator
DOCTOR: In exchange. I wouldn't have thought his ambitions lay in that direction.
STEVENSON: Look out, Doctor.
LEADER: Do not kill them.
SHEPRAH: Another human.
KELLMAN: Take me to Vorus.
SHEPRAH: Vorus?
KELLMAN: Quickly, man. It's vital I see Vorus immediately.
SHEPRAH: Vorus is no longer in charge here.
KELLMAN: What?
SHEPRAH: Take him away.
KELLMAN: Oh, no, you don't understand. I must see Vorus! You're in danger, all of you!
LEADER: Cyberbombs, the most compact and powerful explosive devices ever invented.
DOCTOR: Yes, and their use was banned by the Armageddon Convention.
LEADER: Cybermen do not subscribe to any theory of morality in war, Doctor. Our calculations indicate that two bombs placed in the central fissure of Voga will fragmatise the planet.
DOCTOR: Fragmatise? Oh well, I suppose we can't expect decent English from a machine.
LEADER: Prime the buckles. Two bombs should be sufficient. Three will make certain.
STEVENSON: Now what have they done?
LEADER: The buckles are now primed. Any attempt to remove the harness before the countdown reaches the red zone will cause a secondary explosion. Do you understand?
LESTER: You mean, if we attempt to release the harness before then, we'll get blown up.
LEADER: Correct. It is as well to keep that thought in your minds.
DOCTOR: And when we reach the centre of Voga, we'll be fragmatised, as you put it.
LEADER: Incorrect. You will have fourteen minutes, the time period of the red zone, to reach your surface and save yourselves by the transmat beam.
STEVENSON: That is not long enough.
LEADER: Fourteen minutes is considered adequate.
DOCTOR: Anything else before we go?
LEADER: Yes, Doctor. Your progress will be followed by radar. Any attempt to deviate from the planned course will be immediately detected and the bombs exploded by means of these manual controls.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
LEADER: Countdown has commenced. You, Doctor, will leave first.
DOCTOR: Careful, careful. I might explode.
DOCTOR: Someone's trying to attract your attention. Come on, let's get out of here!
DOCTOR: If only they knew about the use of gold.
STEVENSON: You mean as a weapon?
DOCTOR: Yes. It's the only thing that's effective against Cybermen.
LESTER: Do you believe all this guff about giving us time to escape?
DOCTOR: Not a word of it. Once we've reached the explosive zone we'll have outlived our usefulness.
LESTER: So what do we do now?
DOCTOR: Keep moving. Give their radar scope something to follow.
CYBERMAN: Our warriors report all initial opposition has been crushed.
LEADER: Excellent. They are now one hundred metres below the surface.
CYBERMAN: Kellman has not returned.
LEADER: He is of no importance now. His part in our operation is at an end.
TYRAM: What's your connection with Vorus?
KELLMAN: We were working together. We wanted to lure the Cybermen into a trap.
TYRAM: What trap?
KELLMAN: We're wasting time. The Cybermen are planning to blow Voga apart.
TYRAM: What trap!
KELLMAN: The Beacon, of course. Vorus has a rocket aimed at the Beacon.
SARAH: What? Harry, we've got to warn the Doctor!
SHEPRAH: Councillor, the Cybermen are here!
TYRAM: What?
SHEPRAH: They've landed on the first level. We've suffered heavy casualties and need reinforcements.
TYRAM: How many Cybermen are there?
SHEPRAH: Two, at least. Our weapons have no effect on them.
KELLMAN: You'll never stop them that way. Vorus' rocket is your only chance. That Beacon has to be blasted out of the sky.
SARAH: No.
TYRAM: We must attack the Cybermen with every weapon we have.
SHEPRAH: Very well.
TYRAM: The rest of you, come with me. We must speak to Vorus.
LESTER: Why don't we just wait here?
DOCTOR: I think my idea's better.
LESTER: What is your idea?
DOCTOR: I don't know yet. That's the trouble with ideas. They only come a bit at a time.
TYRAM: Do you not recognise Tyram, Chief Councillor of Voga! Stand aside!
KELLMAN: We've got to see Vorus.
TYRAM: Stand aside, I say.
HARRY: Sarah, can you try and reach the transmat?
SARAH: And warn the Doctor. Right.
HARRY: I'll see if I can do something about this lot.
SARAH: Take care.
HARRY: And you.
TYRAM: Vorus, call off your guards!
VORUS: Enough. You should know better, Tyram, that to try to use force.
TYRAM: Our planet is being attacked, Vorus. At this hour, Vogans should fight together, not against each other.
KELLMAN: Vorus, is the rocket ready to fire?
VORUS: The bomb head is being fitted now.
KELLMAN: Too late. The Cybermen have already landed.
VORUS: What! Have you betrayed us?
KELLMAN: I tried to warn you. Once they were on the Beacon, I couldn't delay them any further.
TYRAM: What's this rocket that you speak of, Vorus?
VORUS: Very well, I'll show you.
KELLMAN: Where's the girl?
HARRY: She's gone to warn the Doctor, of course. If people are going to start firing missiles at him, what do they expect?
KELLMAN: If that girl reaches the Beacon and starts blabbing about the rocket, the Cybermen will explode their bombs.
CYBERMAN: Average progress rate is fifty metres per minute.
LEADER: Excellent. They will be in the central chamber of Voga.
LEADER: In seventeen minutes.
CYBERMAN: Distortion on our radar scope is increasing. The three humans who are carrying our bombs can no longer be identified by separate signals.
LEADER: That is of no importance now. Even the Doctor believes they will be given time to escape before our bombs explode. They do not know the detonators will fire when the countdown enters the red zone.
VORUS: Magrik and his team have been working on it for two years, and now we've lost the race by minutes.
KELLMAN: There might still be a chance if that rocket can be fired before the Cyberbombs are in position.
VORUS: Magrik reports a delay in fitting the bomb head. No, we've lost our gamble, Kellman.
TYRAM: You're insane, Vorus. You've brought about the destruction of our race.
VORUS: I wanted to bring them freedom, Tyram. Freedom from fear, freedom to live as Vogans should, on the surface, not cowering like worms in the earth.
TYRAM: And this great plan was conceived in the company of such as he, a double agent, a despicable traitor, a murder of his own kind? A man whose only loyalty is to himself and the gold he hopes to win.
VORUS: The plan would have worked. I just needed more time.
HARRY: Look, all this recrimination's pretty pointless, isn't it. What we've got to do is get down into that central shaft and stop the bombs being planted.
KELLMAN: The Cybermen hold the entrance. There's no way past them.
HARRY: I should think there's another way down, wouldn't you, Kellman?
KELLMAN: Only the central shaft runs that deep, and the galleries don't connect with it.
TYRAM: Wait. When it was widened, a cross shaft was bored to provide ventilation. I've seen it in our records.
HARRY: Well, let's go and take a look.
DOCTOR: Steady.
STEVENSON: I'm getting a bit old for this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: We'll rest for a moment.
LESTER: Had any more bits of that idea, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The deeper we go, the heavier the concentration of gold. Before long, it must start affecting their radar picture.
LESTER: Then what?
DOCTOR: Well, it's an outside chance, but if we can get back without being detected, and take the Cybermen from behind. All right now, Commander?
STEVENSON: Yes, I think so.
DOCTOR: Let's go.
TYRAM: It runs for about fifty metres, and the rock's friable. It'll be very dangerous after all these years.
HARRY: Well, in that case, we'll send our expert on ahead. In you go, Kellman.
STEVENSON: I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm a bit whacked.
DOCTOR: Sit down a moment. Actually, I think we're very near the centre now. This is pretty well solid gold.
LESTER: I wonder if these buckles really would explode.
STEVENSON: I shouldn't put it to the test. They'll explode, all right.
KELLMAN: It's blocked.
HARRY: Let's see it.
KELLMAN: It's no use. We'll have to turn back.
HARRY: They're giving a bit.
DOCTOR: Look out! Get back!
KELLMAN: Look out!
HARRY: Doctor. Just a bump on the noggin, Doctor. Nothing to worry about. Let's get you out of this thing.
Part Four
LESTER: Harry, don't touch it. Open that buckle and you'll be blown to kingdom come.
HARRY: You mean it's booby trapped?
LESTER: These buckles can't be opened until the Cybermen beam the release signal.
DOCTOR: Harry, were you trying to undo this?
HARRY: Well, naturally.
DOCTOR: Did you make the rocks fall, Harry?
HARRY: Er, well, I suppose I must have done, yes.
DOCTOR: Harry Sullivan is an imbecile!
CYBERMAN: Progression rate has slowed to thirty metres a minute.
LEADER: Then the bombs will explode in eleven minutes from now.
DOCTOR: So where is Sarah?
HARRY: I'm not sure, Doctor. When I last saw her, she was trying to get back to the Beacon.
DOCTOR: What?
HARRY: Yes. You see, we thought you were still up there, and she naturally wanted to warn you about the rocket. Sorry, I can see you're not with me.
DOCTOR: Harry, I'm not with you.
HARRY: No, you see, it seems that Kellman, er, he's dead, by the way. Kellman was really working for the Vogan people, and he got the other half, the, what do you call them?
STEVENSON: Cybermen.
HARRY: Cybermen, that's right. Terribly bad on names. Got the Cybermen up on the Beacon so that they'd be sitting ducks for the Vogan's rocket. Only the Vogans haven't finished the rocket yet, so things have gone a bit wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes.
LESTER: Doctor, we've got about nine minutes.
DOCTOR: Listen, listen, listen! Commander, if you were to keep on going towards the centre, you could draw the radar track away from the rest of us.
STEVENSON: Yes?
DOCTOR: Meantime, Lester and I could take the cross shaft and attack the Cybermen from the rear.
LESTER: What with?
DOCTOR: Gold. Plain, old-fashioned gold.
STEVENSON: Well then, Lester? Agreed. Right.
DOCTOR: Good luck, Commander.
STEVENSON: And to you.
DOCTOR: Come on.
CYBERMAN: Our surface party report the Vogan attackers have been driven off with heavy casualties.
LEADER: Order them to intensify the radar signal.
CYBERMAN: It is already at maximum, Leader.
LEADER: The signal is difficult to interpret. What depth have the bomb carriers reached?
CYBERMAN: Sixteen hundred metres. They are eight minutes from the detonation zone.
LEADER: Eight minutes. In eight minutes the accursed Planet of Gold will be utterly destroyed.
LEADER: Annihilated, vapourised. It is good.
DOCTOR: How much have we got?
LESTER: We've got about five minutes.
DOCTOR: I know we've got five minutes. I mean how much gold dust have we got?
DOCTOR: That might be enough. You know what to do?
HARRY: Yes. Creep as close as we can then chuck this stuff into their chest units.
DOCTOR: You've got it, Harry. Come on.
TYRAM: As the human said, recrimination is pointless now. But I promise you, Vorus, if by some miracle our planet should survive, you will face trial for treason.
VORUS: It's you who should be tried, Tyram. You and your creeping sycophantinous city.
TYRAM: As leader of the Guardians, you abused your trust. You opened the route to the surface. You made clandestine contact with aliens, and you beamed radio transmissions out into space. There are no greater crimes in our calendar.
VORUS: In your calendar, Tyram! Your cowering, furtive, underworld life. If we survive, I will face trial gladly. I will give the people my reasons. I wanted to free them from this tyranny of dark, living rock.
TYRAM: Living the way we had for generations, at least we were safe, Vorus. Safe from the genocidal threat of the Cybermen.
VORUS: I had a dream.
TYRAM: A folly, conceived out of arrogance through overweening ambition.
VORUS: We could have traded with other worlds, exchanged our gold for armaments. We could have been strong enough to defend ourselves against Cybermen or any other attackers.
SHEPRAH: Councillor, we are beaten. Our people withdraw and are refusing to attack the Cybermen again.
VORUS: Order them back! Command them!
SHEPRAH: I'm sorry, Councillor. We need time to regroup.
VORUS: There is no time.
TYRAM: Come, I will speak to them.
DOCTOR: There they are. Wait till I give the signal.
DOCTOR: Ready?
DOCTOR: Now.
DOCTOR: Come on, Harry. Run for it.
DOCTOR: Come on.
DOCTOR: It's still working.
LEADER: They have lost radar contact.
CYBERMAN: Our information flow from the surface has ceased. The countdown has stopped.
LEADER: Select video picture of Voga. Detonation by manual control.
SARAH: No! No, don't!
CYBERMAN: Shall I destroy the human female?
LEADER: Detonation now!
LEADER: It has failed. Why?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm impressed.
SARAH: Voga. It's still there!
LEADER: Yes. For the moment.
SARAH: Then your plan failed. The Doctor's beaten you.
LEADER: Silence. We have not failed. Our computers are assessing an alternative plan.
SARAH: Your best plan is to get off this Beacon before the Vogans 
LEADER: Continue. The Vogans?
SARAH: Kellman led you into a trap. They've got a rocket aimed right at this
LEADER: You lie.
SARAH: Well, stick around and
LEADER: You lie, because if they had such a rocket, they would have used it by now.
SARAH: All I know is when I left, Kellman said the rocket
LEADER: Kellman? So they have a rocket, but they have not used it. Logical conclusion, the rocket has a malfunction, therefore this information does not affect our plans. We shall proceed. Voga will be destroyed.
TYRAM: We are grateful to you, human, for saving Voga.
DOCTOR: Oh, please, don't call me human. Just Doctor will do very nicely, thank you. Is that your rocket?
VORUS: The Sky Striker, yes. You've delivered our enemies into my hands, Doctor. Magrik, you have news?
MAGRIK: Everything is now ready, Vorus. We can start the countdown.
VORUS: Excellent.
DOCTOR: Er, before you do anything rash, like pressing another button, may I make an alternative suggestion?
VORUS: An alternative?
DOCTOR: Let me take the transmat back to the Beacon and deal with the Cybermen myself.
TYRAM: Yourself? You mean, alone?
DOCTOR: Give me just fifteen minutes. If at the end of that time I haven't come through on the radio, well then you can fire off your rocket.
TYRAM: You've already done so much. Why should you risk your life again in this way?
DOCTOR: I've a young friend on the Beacon. Sarah Jane, the girl who was here. She risked her life to save mine. The least I can do is accept the same risk for her.
VORUS: Bah.
DOCTOR: Just fifteen minutes. Is that so intolerable?
TYRAM: Fifteen minutes then, Doctor, but no longer.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Tyram. There's just one other thing I need.
TYRAM: What's that?
DOCTOR: A bag of gold dust.
TYRAM: Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Harry.
HARRY: Doctor?
DOCTOR: While I'm gone, you'd better find the Commander.
HARRY: I'll try.
VORUS: I have planned for this moment for years, and now as I close the trap you expect me to wait.
LEADER: Point of impact.
CYBERMAN: Twenty seven degrees seven minutes north, a hundred and sixty degrees twenty minutes east. The crust is weakest at this point.
LEADER: Velocity at impact, ten thousand light units.
CYBERMAN: Calculations indicate at maximum thrust, the Beacon will attain that velocity seven minutes before impact.
LEADER: What explosive force is required to sunder the planet at that depth?
CYBERMAN: One thousand kilos per unit.
LEADER: Excellent. Then the plan will be executed.
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: Order the bombs to be transferred to the Beacon.
LEADER: The alternative plan will work. When the Beacon crashes into Voga, we shall be watching from a safe distance, but you will have a much closer view.
SARAH: Doc
DOCTOR:  Shush.
SARAH: Sorry.
DOCTOR: You haven't seen anything of the Tardis, have you?
SARAH: Tardis? Listen, Doctor, the Cybermen are loading this Beacon with bombs. They're going to smash it into Voga.
DOCTOR: Are they? And we've got about nine minutes before the Vogans aim their rocket at us. Get the control box. We'll see what we can do.
SARAH: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
SARAH: It's good to see you.
DOCTOR: Is it?
SARAH: Yes.
DOCTOR: Oh. Right. Come on, quickly then.
LEADER: Carry the bombs to the nose cone. Maximum urgency imperative.
MAGRIK: Seven minutes, Vorus.
VORUS: What can the Doctor do in this time? We should never have agreed to wait.
TYRAM: Stand back from the firing button, Vorus! There is, as Magrik says, another seven minutes.
VORUS: Don't worry, Tyram. I can wait. But when I press that button, it will mean more than the end of the Cybermen. It will mean the start of a whole new life here on Voga. A new regime.
TYRAM: That will be for the people to decide.
VORUS: This was my idea, I planned it all. I shall be the people's liberator.
TYRAM: You came very close to being their destroyer.
VORUS: That will be forgotten in my triumph. The people will turn to me. They will beg me to lead them!
HARRY: Any news from the Doctor?
VORUS: No, and I don't expect there will be.
MAGRIK: Five minutes.
SARAH: There's no point filling it with gold dust. It won't attack the Cybermen.
DOCTOR: Just you wait and see.
SARAH: What was that?
DOCTOR: They've started the engines.
LEADER: She has been freed. One of her friends from Voga. Perhaps the Doctor.
CYBERMAN: All engines normal. Zero thrust.
LEADER: Increase ten levels. If it was the Doctor, he will make a further attempt to thwart my plan. Therefore he will still be concealed aboard. Search the forward compartments. Locate and destroy all animal organisms.
CYBERMAN: Control response normal. Engine response effective. Thrust five thousand.
LEADER: Engage hyperdrive.
SARAH: Listen.
DOCTOR: Come on, let's hide.
SARAH: You did it.
DOCTOR: Looks like it.
SARAH: Hurry!
DOCTOR: Dusty death. Out, out with
SARAH: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What?
SARAH: Come on!
VORUS: Control to firing bunker. Stand by for countdown.
TYRAM: We have another two minutes.
VORUS: The countdown
MAGRIK: Vorus! Look. The target sensor, it's moving.
VORUS: The Beacon's in motion!
MAGRIK: It's coming towards us! It's set on a collision course!
VORUS: Activate firing controls!
HARRY: Vorus, you promised the Doctor fifteen minutes.
STEVENSON: Vorus!
VORUS: You fools!
STEVENSON: No, Vorus.
TYRAM: No, Vorus, no!
VORUS: My Sky Striker, my glory.
LEADER: We must evacuate the Beacon in three minutes.
CYBERMAN: Our calculations indicate the fireball will extend one point five million miles.
SARAH: Oh! Doctor!
DOCTOR: All right, all right, all right. You've made your point. We surrender. We surrender.
LEADER: You have interfered once too often, Doctor.
LEADER: Now, tie her up. Tie her up!
TYRAM: The Doctor's time's up. He's failed.
STEVENSON: I'm afraid so.
HARRY: I wouldn't be too sure, Commander.
STEVENSON: His only chance now is to get off the Beacon by the transmat. The rocket is due to impact in six minutes.
LEADER: The Beacon is approaching Voga at ten thousand light units. It is time for us to leave.
DOCTOR: Bye bye.
LEADER: You two are especially privileged. You are about to die in the biggest explosion ever witnessed in this solar system. It will be a magnificent spectacle. Unhappily, you will be unable to appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Nice sense of irony. I thought for a moment he was going to smile.
SARAH: How long have we got, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Judging by the speed at which the rocket is approaching, two or three minutes.
SARAH: The Vogan rocket?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right.
STEVENSON: They're getting away!
TYRAM: Then the Sky Striker will simply destroy the empty Beacon.
HARRY: If it is empty.
SARAH: Oh, it's no good, Doctor. They won't budge.
DOCTOR: Hmm? I used to untangle Turk's Head eye-splice with the grommets I picked up from Houdini. It should work.
SARAH: Really. Well, you must have tied it wrong. No, wait a minute. You're right, they're loosening!
DOCTOR: Good girl. That rocket's getting too close for comfort.
DOCTOR: Hello, Voga. Hello, Voga. This is Nerva Beacon.
STEVENSON : Doctor, is that you?
DOCTOR: Commander, tell Vorus the Cybermen have abandoned the beacon. He's to aim the rocket at the cybership.
STEVENSON: But Doctor, Vorus is dead, and none of us here knows how to operate these controls.
DOCTOR : What? Just let me think.
STEVENSON: Let you what?
HARRY: Just let him think.
SARAH: Doctor, it's going to hit any second!
DOCTOR: Commander?
STEVENSON : Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There are two levers on the left of the panel. Got them?
STEVENSON: Yes, I've got them.
DOCTOR : The top lever controls the angle of flight, and the lower one must be the direction and stabiliser control.
DOCTOR: Cogito ergo sum.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: I think, therefore it missed.
SARAH: Yes, but we're still heading for the biggest bang in history!
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Oh no. They've locked the gyro controls. The flight trimmers are jammed.
SARAH: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It means we're heading for the biggest bang in history.
TYRAM: The rocket is closing on the Cybermen's ship.
HARRY: A touch more starboard rudder, Commander.
STEVENSON: Come on. Just a few more seconds.
CYBERMAN: There's a missile on our port bow.
LEADER: Engage full thrust! Deploy
HARRY: That's the end of your Cybermen.
TYRAM: Never again will they be a threat to Voga. At least we can live without fear.
STEVENSON: Why doesn't the Doctor put the Beacon back on course? I thought he was taking evasive action, but look, he's coming straight towards us.
HARRY: Better give him a whistle, Commander. He does have these absent minded moments.
HARRY : Hello, Doctor, can you hear me?
SARAH: Yes, Harry. What is it?
HARRY : Hello, Sarah. Look old girl, I don't know if you're aware of it, but you appear to be heading straight for us!
SARAH: Yes, we are aware of it, Harry. Very much so, and we're loaded with cyberbombs.
HARRY: What? Well, you'd better do something, old girl, and quickly.
SARAH : The Doctor's doing his best, but
SARAH: The Cybermen have locked the gyro controls.
STEVENSON: It's still coming straight towards us.
TYRAM: It's going to hit. It's going to hit!
DOCTOR: That should do it.
SARAH: We're going to crash!
DOCTOR: Hang on. If I pull her back at this speed, she'll break in half.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think she'll settle down nicely into orbit now.
SARAH: Oh, good.
DOCTOR: I think I'll just set the drift compensators. We don't want it slipping through our fingers.
HARRY: I see old faithful turned up after all.
SARAH: Hi.
DOCTOR: Don't just stand there. Come on.
SARAH: Oh, all go, isn't it.
DOCTOR: I'm needed back on Earth.
SARAH: How do you know?
DOCTOR: I left the Brigadier a space-time telegraph system and told him not to use it unless he had a real emergency on his hands.
SARAH: And he's used it?
DOCTOR: He has. Come on, you two.
HARRY: I say, what about the Commander? Aren't we going to stop and say cheerio?
DOCTOR : Come on!
SARAH: Don't argue.
