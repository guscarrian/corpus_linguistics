The Five Doctors
DOCTOR 1: One day, I shall come back. Yes, I shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs and prove to me that I am not mistaken in mine.
TEGAN: Finished?
DOCTOR 5: Yes. Looks rather splendid, doesn't it?
TEGAN: But will the Tardis work properly?
DOCTOR 5: Of course, once everything's run in.
TEGAN: Didn't you repair anything?
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis is more than a machine, Tegan. It's like a person. It needs coaxing, persuading, encouraging.
TEGAN: You mean it's just as unreliable.
DOCTOR 5: You have little faith, Tegan.
TEGAN: Do you blame me?
TURLOUGH: It's marvellous here. I feel so calm and relaxed.
DOCTOR 5: It's the high bombardment of positive ions.
TEGAN: It's like Earth after a thunderstorm.
DOCTOR 5: Same cause and reason.
TEGAN: It's beautiful.
DOCTOR 5: For some, the Eye of Orion is the most tranquil place in the universe.
TEGAN: Can't we stay here?
DOCTOR 5: Why not? For a while. We could do with a rest.
DOCTOR 5: Ah!
TURLOUGH: Are you all right?
DOCTOR 5: Just a twinge of cosmic angst.
TEGAN: Cosmic?
DOCTOR 5: As if I'd lost something.
CRICHTON: Right.
BRIGADIER: Thank you.
CRICHTON: Well, to civilian life.
BRIGADIER: You know, I can't tell you how much I was looking forward to this reunion. A chance of re-meeting old friends.
CRICHTON: There was one chap we tried to get hold of. What was his name? Used to be your scientific advisor.
BRIGADIER: Oh, the Doctor.
CRICHTON: Yes that's right.
BRIGADIER: Wonderful chap. All of them.
CRICHTON: Them?
CRICHTON: Yes?
SERGEANT : Excuse me, sir, sorry to interrupt. Someone's arrived.
CRICHTON: I'm not expecting anyone.
SERGEANT: Insists on seeing Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart.
CRICHTON : How did he know he was here?
SERGEANT: I'm sorry, sir, you're not allowed in there.
DOCTOR 2: Not allowed? Me? I'm allowed everywhere.
DOCTOR 2: Oh, thank you. Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: Good heavens. Is it you?
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes. For once, I was able to steer the Tardis. And here I am.
CRICHTON: It's all right, Sergeant.
SERGEANT: Very good, sir.
DOCTOR 2: I'm not too late, am I?
BRIGADIER: What for?
DOCTOR 2: For your speech as guest of honour.
BRIGADIER: How did you know?
DOCTOR 2: I saw it in the Times.
CRICHTON: That's impossible. The reporter's still here.
DOCTOR 2: Tomorrow's Times. And, er, and who is this?
BRIGADIER: That's Colonel Crichton, my replacement.
DOCTOR 2: Ah. Yes, mine was pretty unpromising, too.
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor, we'll take a stroll round the ground, shall we? Awfully sorry about this. Do excuse me for a moment. DOCTOR 2: You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm. Don't like it.
BRIGADIER: Come along, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: After you.
BRIGADIER: What?
DOCTOR 2: After you.
BRIGADIER: Oh, very well.
SERGEANT: Everything all right, sir?
CRICHTON: What the blazes is going on? Who was that strange little man?
SERGEANT: The Doctor.
CRICHTON: Who?
BRIGADIER: Yes. Yeti, Cybermen. We've seen some times, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: And Omega. Don't forget Omega.
BRIGADIER: As if I could!
DOCTOR 2: And the terrible Zodin.
BRIGADIER: Who?
DOCTOR 2: Oh, you weren't concerned with her, were you? She happened in the future. They were covered in hair. Used to hop like kangaroos. Well, I must say goodbye, Brigadier. I really shouldn't be here at all. I'm not exactly breaking the laws of time, but I am bending them a little.
BRIGADIER: You never did bother much about rules, as I remember. What's the matter?
BRIGADIER: What is it?
DOCTOR 2: Brigadier, I think our past is catching up on us. Or maybe it's our future. Come on, run!
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I'm too old for his sort of thing.
DOCTOR 2: Where's it gone? We must get back to the Tardis before it's too late. Run!
TEGAN: Doctor, what is it?
DOCTOR 5: It's fading. It's all fading.
TURLOUGH: What's fading?
DOCTOR 5: Great chunks of my past, detaching themselves like melting icebergs. Ah!
TEGAN: Do something. Help him!
DOCTOR 5: Oh, no. No, don't look so worried. I'll have it all worked out soon. Everything's all right. Everything's quite all right.
DOCTOR 3: Great balls of fire!
 DOCTOR 3: Good old Bessie.
TEGAN: What's happening to him? What are we going to do?
TURLOUGH: He seems to be under some kind of psychic attack.
DOCTOR 5: I am being diminished. Whittled away, piece by piece. A man is the sum of his memories, you know. A Time Lord even more so.
TEGAN: What can we do to help you?
DOCTOR 5: Get me into the Tardis.
DOCTOR 5: Ah! I have to find, to find
TURLOUGH: Find what?
DOCTOR 5: My other selves.
K9: Mistress, do not go out.
SARAH: What is it?
K9: Danger, Mistress.
SARAH: What?
K9: I can sense danger, Mistress. Telepathic trace faint but rapidly increasing in strength. Do not go out.
SARAH: What kind of danger?
K9: Positive data not yet available.
SARAH: Well, I can't stay home. You have to give me a reason.
K9: Negative, Mistress. Data analysis shows too many variables. Danger readings now becoming much higher, Mistress. Suggestion. Take me with you.
SARAH: I can't. Honestly, I can't. The car's in docks so I've got to go by bus.
K9: There is danger, Mistress. My sensors indicate it is now extreme. And the Doctor is involved.
SARAH: Well, now I know you're imagining things. See you later.
K9: Danger! Doctor! Danger! Mistress!
DOCTOR 4: Wordsworth, Rutherford, Christopher Smart, Andrew Marvell, Judge Jeffreys, Owen Chadwick.
ROMANA: Who? 
DOCTOR 4: Owen Chadwick. Oh, yes, some of the greatest labourers in the history of Earth have thought here.
ROMANA: Newton, of course.
DOCTOR 4: Oh, definitely Newton.
ROMANA: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
DOCTOR 4: That's right.
ROMANA: So, Newton invented punting.
DOCTOR 4: Oh, yes. There was no limit to Isaac's genius.
ROMANA: Isn't it wonderful how something so primitive can be so
DOCTOR 4: Restful?
ROMANA: No, simple. You just push in one direction and the boat goes in the other. Oh, I do love the spring. All the leaves, the colours.
DOCTOR 4: It's October.
ROMANA: I thought you said we were coming here for May week.
DOCTOR 4: I did. May week's in June.
ROMANA: I'm confused.
DOCTOR 4: So was the Tardis.
ROMANA: Oh, I do love the autumn. All the leaves, the colours.
DOCTOR 4: Yes. Well, at least with something as simple as a punt nothing can go wrong. No co-ordinates, no dimensional stabilisers, nothing. Just the water, the punt, a strong pair of hands and a pole.
TEGAN: Oh no!
TEGAN: Two hearts.
TURLOUGH: Well, his body's all right. He just seems to be fading away. Why did he have to set the Tardis moving? We were safe before he did that.
TEGAN: Look
TEGAN: Doctor?
TEGAN: What's going on? 
TURLOUGH: We've landed.
TURLOUGH: According to the instruments, we're nowhere, in no time.
TEGAN: The Doctor must have forgotten to reconnect something.
TURLOUGH: No. The instruments are all working perfectly. They just won't tell us anything. The Tardis is paralysed.
TEGAN: How did we get here? What do we do now?
TURLOUGH: We wait until the Doctor recovers.
TEGAN: And if he doesn't?
BORUSA: Well?
CASTELLAN: He has arrived.
BORUSA: Involving this person does not please me.
CASTELLAN: The constitution clearly states that when in emergency session, the members of the inner council are unanimous
FLAVIA: Which indeed we are
BORUSA: The President of the Council may be overruled. What a ridiculous clause. Very well, have him enter.
CASTELLAN: With all due respect, Lord President, your regeneration has not helped your stubbornness.
MASTER: Lord President, Castellan, Chancellor Flavia. This is a very great and, may I say, a most unexpected honour. I may be seated? Now then, what can I do for you?
BORUSA: You are one of the most evil and corrupt beings this Time Lord race has ever produced. Your crimes are without number and your villainy without end. Nevertheless, we are prepared to offer you a full and free pardon.
MASTER: What makes you think I want your forgiveness?
CASTELLAN: We can offer you an alternative to your renegade existence.
BORUSA: Regeneration. A complete new life cycle.
MASTER: What must I do?
BORUSA: Rescue the Doctor.
MASTER: What?
DOCTOR 1: Susan. Surely it's Susan.
SUSAN: Grandfather. Oh, Grandfather!
SUSAN: Thank goodness I've found you. How did we get here? What's happening?
DOCTOR 1: I wish I knew, my dear.
SUSAN: As soon as I found myself in this horrible place I started looking for you. Somehow I knew I'd find you here.
DOCTOR 1: Well, the important question now is where are we, and why?
SUSAN:  We must be on Skaro.
DOCTOR 1:  We were brought here. Perhaps the Dalek was, too.
SUSAN: Run, Grandfather!
DALEK: Halt at once. Halt or you will be exterminated. It is the Doctor. The Doctor must be destroyed. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate!
BORUSA: The Death Zone.
MASTER: Ah., the black secret at the heart of your Time Lord paradise.
CASTELLAN: Recently, the Zone has become reactivated. Somehow, it is draining energy from the Eye of Harmony.
FLAVIA: To an extent which endangers all Gallifrey.
BORUSA: We must know what is happening there.
MASTER: Did it occur to you to go and look?
BORUSA: Two of the High Council went into the Zone. Neither returned.
MASTER: So you sent for the Doctor?
CASTELLAN: We looked for the Doctor, but he no longer exists. Not in any of his regenerations.
BORUSA: The Doctor has been taken out of time.
CASTELLAN: We believe the attempt to lift him from his time stream was unsuccessful. There he must stay until we can find and free his other selves.
MASTER: And if you cannot? The cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bares thinking about. What makes you think his other selves are in the Zone?
BORUSA: Their time traces. They converge there.
MASTER: And you can get me into the Zone?
CASTELLAN: We have a power-boosted, open-ended transmat beam.
MASTER: Ah. Why me?
BORUSA: Because we need someone determined, experienced, ruthless, cunning.
MASTER: And disposable?
CASTELLAN: Not at all. You would be useless to us dead.
FLAVIA: Will you go?
BORUSA: Will you?
MASTER: And rescue the Doctor.
TEGAN: Come on, Doctor.
TURLOUGH: Hold on!
TEGAN: What's happening to you?
DOCTOR 5: I'm being sucked into a time vortex. Part of me there already. It's pulling the rest. I must send a signal.
TEGAN: What signal?
DOCTOR 5: I must send a signal. Find them. I must be whole.
DALEK: Halt at once or you will be exterminated. Halt! Halt! Obey. Obey the Daleks. You will be exterminated. Exterminate! Exterminate!
SUSAN: Oh, It's a dead end!
DOCTOR 1: That may be precisely what we need.
SUSAN: No, Grandfather, come on, please!
DOCTOR 1: No, no, no, don't argue, Susan. Listen to me. Now, when I say now, help me to push the Dalek down that alley, and when I say drop, drop. Understood?
DOCTOR 1: Now, Susan!
DALEK: Under attack!
DOCTOR 1: Drop!
DALEK: Under attack!
DALEK: Exterminate! Under attack! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
DOCTOR 1: It's very dangerous to fire energy weapons in an enclosed space.
SUSAN: Look!
DOCTOR 1: The Dark Tower.
SUSAN: We're on Gallifrey.
DOCTOR 1: The Death Zone.
SUSAN: Why were we brought here?
DOCTOR 1: Instinct, my dear, tells me that the answer to that lies in the Tower.
BRIGADIER: Charming spot, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: My dear Brigadier, it's no use blaming me.
BRIGADIER: You attract trouble, Doctor. You always did. Where the devil are we?
DOCTOR 2: I'm not sure, but I have some very nasty suspicions. What's that?
BRIGADIER: Huh?
DOCTOR 2: Over there.
BRIGADIER: There's something moving.
DOCTOR 2: No, get down.
DOCTOR 2: Don't worry, Brigadier.
DOCTOR 2: Run!
DOCTOR 3: Now what?
SARAH: Oh. Oh, K9, why didn't I listen to you?
DOCTOR 3: Hang on a minute.
DOCTOR 3: Catch hold of this.
SARAH: Oh, I never thought I'd be so pleased to see anyone.
DOCTOR 3: I think we should come away from the ledge, don't you?
SARAH: Wait a moment. It's you.
DOCTOR 3: Of course it's me. Hello, Sarah Jane.
SARAH: No, no, it's you you.
DOCTOR 3: That's right.
SARAH: No. No, you changed remember? You became all, er
DOCTOR 3: Teeth and curls?
SARAH: Yes.
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, maybe I did, but I haven't yet.
SARAH: Oh, I see. No, I don't. Never mind. Yes, well, thank you very much for rescuing me, Doctor, and now perhaps you'll explain why I'm here to need rescuing.
DOCTOR 3: Steady on, Sarah Jane. I'm not exactly here by choice either, you know.
SARAH: Then, what are we doing here?
DOCTOR 3: Well, I'll try and explain. Come on, get in the car.
DOCTOR 5: I've got to. What is it I've got to do?
TEGAN: You said something about a signal.
TURLOUGH: About being whole.
DOCTOR 5: Ah yes, of course. A recall signal.
TEGAN: What's the signal for, Doctor? Who's it to?
DOCTOR 5: I must send the signal. They'll hear it. That'll bring them.
TEGAN: Doctor, tell where the signal control is so we can help you.
DOCTOR 5: It's, it's
DOCTOR 1: Oh, it's no good. I shall have to rest.
SUSAN: Oh, yes, of course, Grandfather. I'll just go and take another look.
DOCTOR 1: Yes, yes.
SUSAN: Look. Come and see.
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? What? Goodness me! The Tardis!
SUSAN: What's it doing here?
DOCTOR 1: I suggest we go and find out.
TEGAN: He's only just about conscious.
TURLOUGH: If only he'd managed to send that signal.
TEGAN: Who are you?
DOCTOR 1: More to the point, what are you young people doing inside my Tardis?
TEGAN: It's his Tardis.
DOCTOR 1: And who might he be?
TURLOUGH: The Doctor.
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Good grief.
DOCTOR 5: You're here. You're here.
DOCTOR 1: Yes, evidently. Now, take it steadily, my boy, and let me help you up.
DOCTOR 5: I tried to send a recall signal.
DOCTOR 1: Yes, it doesn't matter. How do you come to be here?
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tardis was, er. I don't know.
DOCTOR 1: Never mind that.
SUSAN: Is he really
DOCTOR 1: Me? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so. Regeneration?
DOCTOR 5: Fourth.
DOCTOR 1: Goodness me! So, there are five of me now! Oh, er, this is Susan.
DOCTOR 5: Yes, I know.
DOCTOR 1: And, er, you two are
TURLOUGH: Turlough.
TEGAN: And I'm Tegan Jovanka. Who might you be?
DOCTOR 1: I might be any number of things, young lady. As it happens, I am the Doctor. The original, you might say.
TEGAN: But you shouldn't be here at the same time, with him, should you?
DOCTOR 1: Certainly not.
DOCTOR 5: It only happens in the gravest emergencies.
DOCTOR 1: Like now.
DOCTOR 5: Yes, unfortunately.
DOCTOR 1: Now look, young lady. Make yourself useful. This young fellow looks as though he needs some refreshment and I know that Susan and I do, too.
TEGAN: Hang on a minute.
DOCTOR 5: Tegan, Tegan, Tegan. Humour him. You know, I sometimes used to get a little tetchy. Fortunately one mellows with age. Turlough will help.
TURLOUGH: Thank you.
DOCTOR 1: And now, young fellow, tell me all about it.
FLAVIA: The Seal of the High Council. It may help to convince the Doctors of your good faith.
MASTER: Perhaps.
CASTELLAN: It's time to go. When you have something to tell us, activate this.
CASTELLAN: We will pick up your signal and transmat you back.
MASTER: Isn't anyone going to wish me luck?
BORUSA: We wish you success, for all our sakes.
CASTELLAN: And now, we wait.
BORUSA: I would prefer to wait alone.
MASTER: One of my predecessors.
MASTER: Not the most hospitable of environments.
DOCTOR 2: It's just as I feared. We're on Gallifrey, in the Death Zone.
BRIGADIER: You know this place?
DOCTOR 2: To my shame. Yes, mine, Brigadier, and that of every other Time Lord. In the days before Rassilon, my ancestors had tremendous powers which they misused disgracefully. They set up this place, the Death Zone, and walled it around with an impenetrable force field, and then they kidnapped other beings and set them down here.
BRIGADIER: But what for?
DOCTOR 2: I'll explain as we go.
BRIGADIER: Where are we going?
DOCTOR 2: To the Tower. To Rassilon, the greatest single figure in Time Lord history.
BRIGADIER: Is that where he lives?
DOCTOR 2: Not exactly, Brigadier. It's his tomb.
DOCTOR 1: You're talking nonsense, my boy. We must send the signal as planned and wait for the others.
DOCTOR 5: No, there's no time. We must leave immediately. Temporal instability's already affecting me.
DOCTOR 1: And without our other selves, we'll be of little use out there.
DOCTOR 5: Well, they'll never make it. There is evil at work.
TEGAN: Evil?
DOCTOR 1: We're in the Death Zone on Gallifrey.
TURLOUGH: How can you be so sure?
DOCTOR 5: Well, the Tomb of Rassilon. Look, can we really afford to wait, especially if someone is tapping his power?
DOCTOR 1: Well, what do you intend to do, young man?
DOCTOR 5: I shall go to the Tower.
DOCTOR 1: But there could be great danger.
DOCTOR 5: Help me set up the computer scanner. We can at least see what is out there.  
DOCTOR 3: All this was the setting for the games. But old Rassilon put a stop to it in the end. He sealed off the entire Zone and forbade the use of the Time Scoop, until now.
SARAH: But why don't they just tell us why we're here?
DOCTOR 3: Because they delight in deviousness, that's why. It amuses them, chucking us in the deep end, watching us sink or swim.
SARAH: Why have we stopped?
DOCTOR 3: So I can get my bearings. Ah ha. There it is.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR 3: The Tomb of Rassilon. That's where we're going.
SARAH: Look, do you think this is wise, Doctor? I mean, well, whatever's in that Tower, it's got enormous powers and, well, what can we do against it?
DOCTOR 3: What I've always done, Sarah Jane. Improvise.
MASTER: Doctor, wait!
SARAH: Who's that?
DOCTOR 3: I don't know. No, it couldn't be.
DOCTOR 3: Jehosophat, it really is you. Yes, well, I should have known you'd be behind all this.
SARAH: Doctor, who is it?
DOCTOR 3: That's my best enemy. He likes to be known as the Master, don't you? My, my, my, but you've changed. Another regeneration?
MASTER: Not exactly.
DOCTOR 3: I take it you are responsible for our being in the Death Zone?
MASTER: For once, I'm innocent, here at the High Council's request to help you, and your other selves.
DOCTOR 3: You? Sent here by the Time Lords to help me? I've never heard such arrant nonsense.
MASTER: I happen to be telling the truth. I carry the Seal of the High Council.
DOCTOR 3: Yes, forged, no doubt.
MASTER: See for yourself.
DOCTOR 3: Stolen, then. I'll return it at the first opportunity.
MASTER: If you would only listen, I'm here to help.
DOCTOR 3: You? Help me? Rubbish. This is some kind of a trap.
MASTER: I knew this was going to be difficult, but I didn't realise that even you would be so stupid as to make it impossible.
DOCTOR 3: I knew it, a trap.
MASTER: These thunderbolts are everywhere.
SARAH: No, we can't leave him.
DOCTOR 3: You just watch me.
DOCTOR 5: Now, as far as I can make out, there are three entrances. One above, one below, and the main door here.
DOCTOR 1: Which do you plan to use?
DOCTOR 5: Er, well, the main door.
DOCTOR 1: I still think you should wait.
DOCTOR 5: There may be very little time.
DOCTOR 3: You see what I mean? A trap.
BORUSA: Is there nothing you can do to retrieve him?
TECHNICIAN: Nothing, my Lord President. With the present energy drain, it is beyond our resources.
BORUSA: You use what spare energy you have to stabilise that portion of the vortex in which he is trapped. It may at least give the remaining Doctors more time.
TECHNICIAN: Lord President.
CASTELLAN: No news from the Master?
BORUSA: Did you really think that there would be?
DOCTOR 2: I wonder, could Rassilon himself have brought us here?
BRIGADIER: Hang on a minute, Doctor. You said this chap Rassilon was dead. You did say that was his tomb?
DOCTOR 2: Oh, it is, but no one really knows how extensive his powers were.
BRIGADIER: He could still be alive?
DOCTOR 2: Watching us at this very moment.
BRIGADIER: Didn't you say he was supposed to be rather a good type?
DOCTOR 2: So the official history says, but there are many rumours and legends to the contrary. Some say his fellow Time Lords rebelled against his cruelty and locked him in the Tower in eternal sleep.
BRIGADIER: And now he's woken up again?
DOCTOR 2: Well, it would explain a great deal. Oh dear.
BRIGADIER: Hmm?
DOCTOR 2: We could be playing the Game of Rassilon at this very moment.
BRIGADIER: Your tone doesn't inspire much confidence. I assume we're not expected to win.
DOCTOR 2: Come on.
TURLOUGH: Even if you. Even if you reach this Tower, what are you going to do?
DOCTOR 5: Er, release the Tardis. The computer scanner's located the force field generator.
SUSAN: I'll come with you.
DOCTOR 5: Hmm.
TEGAN: I'd like to come, too.
DOCTOR 1: No. I think it would be safer if you were to remain here with me.
TEGAN: I'd like to go with him.
DOCTOR 5: Er, yes, yes, all right. Now, you'll bring the Tardis to the Tower as soon as I switch off the force field.
DOCTOR 1: Of course.
DOCTOR 5: Yes, of course. Right, better get started. Time's running out.
DOCTOR 5: Eureka.
SARAH: I thought we were going to the Tower.
DOCTOR 3: We are.
SARAH: Then why this way?
DOCTOR 3: Because the mountains are between us and the Tower, Sarah. That's why.
SARAH: Can't you find an easier way?
DOCTOR 3: No, it'd take far too long.
DOCTOR 3: So, the Master has used the Time Scoop to bring others as well as us here. Come on, let's get out of here.
TURLOUGH: Do you think it will take the Doctor long to reach the Tower?
DOCTOR 1: It depends on what may try to stop him, my boy. Oh, it's not without reason that it's called the Death Zone. Great heavens. Two more traces.
TURLOUGH: Time Lords?
DOCTOR 1: Two more Doctors. The scanner is keyed to my, to our brain patterns. Well, well, well, so two of them made it. I wonder what happened to the other.
DOCTOR 2:  Who to Rassilon's Tower would go, must choose below. No, no, no Who unto Rassilon's Tower will go, must choose above, between, below.
BRIGADIER: Are you in pain, Doctor?
DOCTOR 2: Age has not mellowed you, has it, Brigadier? I was recalling, in point of fact, an old nursery rhyme about the Dark Tower.
BRIGADIER: Does it help?
DOCTOR 2: Considerably more than you do. It describes the different ways to enter the Tower.
BRIGADIER: A nursery rhyme? I never heard anything so ridiculous.
DOCTOR 2: Nevertheless, I propose to put it to the test.
DOCTOR 2: Come along. In here.
DOCTOR 5: Soon be there.
SUSAN: I'm finding this quite exhilarating.
TEGAN: I wish I were.
MASTER: Doctor.
TEGAN: The Master.
DOCTOR 5: Wait here.
MASTER: I know this is going to be hard to believe, Doctor, but for once I mean you no harm.
DOCTOR 5: Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Go on.
MASTER: I've been sent here by the High Council to help you.
SUSAN: Is this man a friend of the Doctor's?
TEGAN: Anything but.
SUSAN: Well, they're talking as if they were friends.
TEGAN: That's what worries me.
CYBERMAN: I have found the ones from the Tardis.
LEADER: Excellent.
CYBERMAN 2: I shall take the patrol and destroy them.
LEADER: No. Capture them alive. They must be interrogated first.
CYBERMAN 2: Leader.
LEADER: We also need the Time Lord to pilot the Tardis. Go.
CYBERMAN 2:  Here are your orders.
MASTER: Be reasonable, Doctor.
DOCTOR 5: I am. I listened.
MASTER: As you see, I'm armed. I could easily kill you if I wanted to.
DOCTOR 5: And not humiliate me first? Oh, that isn't your style at all.
MASTER: I also have a recall device that'll take me back to the conference room in the heart of the Capitol.
DOCTOR 5: So you say. I would prefer more positive proof of your credentials.
MASTER: One of your other selves took it from me.
DOCTOR 5: Do you expect me to believe the fantastic tale you've just told?
TEGAN: Doctor, look out! Cybermen!
DOCTOR 5: Go back!
SUSAN: Well, we can't just leave him.
TEGAN: We can't help him, either. Do as he says. We must warn the others.
DOCTOR 5: After you.
CYBERMAN 2: Halt! Halt, or you will be destroyed.
DOCTOR 5: Zapped.
CASTELLAN : All available power to transmat beam.
CASTELLAN: Locked on.
CASTELLAN : Prepare to retrieve the Master.
CYBERMAN 2: You will accompany us.
CASTELLAN : Transference now.
DOCTOR 5: Sorry, must dash.
TEGAN: Susan, come on!
SUSAN: Ow!
TEGAN: Can you walk?
SUSAN: Ow, just about.
DOCTOR 5: Quite a reception committee.
CYBERMAN 2: This is not the Doctor.
LEADER: Take him.
MASTER: Oof. I've been looking for you.
LEADER: Kill him!
MASTER: I'm here as your friend.
LEADER: Who are you?
MASTER: I am the Master, and your loyal servant.
DOCTOR 2: And then?
SUSAN: Then he just disappeared.
DOCTOR 1: Hmm.
TURLOUGH: What could have happened?
DOCTOR 1: Well, from the way Susan described it, a transmat device.
TEGAN: Yes, but he must have got it from the Master.
SUSAN: I do hope he's all right.
DOCTOR 1: Well, with our young friend gone, I shall have to go to the Dark Tower.
TEGAN: I'll come with you.
DOCTOR 1: Oh. Oh, well, if you must. Thank you, my dear.
DOCTOR 5: It seems I've done the Master an injustice.
BORUSA: If he survived, I'm sure he will learn to live with the misjudgment.
DOCTOR 5: Well, this changes things. If the Master isn't responsible, then who is misusing the Death Zone?
CASTELLAN: We were hoping you could tell us. You have been there.
DOCTOR 5: Who has control of the Time Scoop?
BORUSA: No one. Its use is prohibited.
DOCTOR 5: But the machinery still exists.
BORUSA: Doctor, you seem to be implying that the Time Scoop was used to bring you.
DOCTOR 5: Yes, I am rather.
FLAVIA: Then you accuse a Time Lord.
DOCTOR 5: I think it would be quite an important one, as well.
BORUSA: You have evidence, of course.
DOCTOR 5: No. No, not yet.
BORUSA: Then upon what do you base this outrageous accusation?
DOCTOR 5: Cybermen. Whoever brought me and my other selves here also brought them. Now, you know our legends well enough. Even in our most corrupt period our ancestors never allowed the Cybermen to play the game. Like the Daleks, they play too well.
CASTELLAN: Hardly proof of a traitor.
DOCTOR 5: Then there's this. You know, the Death Zone is a large place, and yet the Cybermen found us very quickly. Almost as if they were supposed to.
BORUSA: They are highly skilled in such things.
DOCTOR 5: Especially when helped. This is the one thing the Master would be sure to keep on him at all times. The recall device. And within.
DOCTOR 5: A homing beacon.
BORUSA: Which you gave him, Castellan.
CASTELLAN: It's a lie. The Doctor wants revenge.
BORUSA: Sit down.
CASTELLAN: I will not submit to such wild accusations.
BORUSA: Commander!
COMMANDER: Lord President?
BORUSA: Institute an immediate and rigorous search of the Castellan's office and living quarters.
LEADER: I do not believe your lies. 
MASTER: What I have said is the truth. We've all been sent here for the same reason.
CYBERMAN 2: To fight?
MASTER: To destroy each other for the amusement of the Time Lords. But you don't have to play their game. You can defeat them, gain your revenge, but only with my help.
LEADER: Explain. 
MASTER: Close by there's a Tower, the fortress of your enemies the Time Lords. It's well defended, but I can help you break in.
CYBERMAN 2: And, what do you ask in return?
MASTER: My life. My freedom. A chance to share in your revenge. To destroy the Time Lords.
LEADER: Guard him.
CYBERMAN: Leader.
LEADER: We will allow him to guide us to this Tower.
CYBERMAN 2: He is an alien. Aliens are not to be trusted.
LEADER: It is not necessary to trust him.
CYBERMAN 2: Will you give him his freedom?
LEADER: Promises to aliens have no validity. When the Tower is in our hands, he will be destroyed.
LEADER: You will guide us to this Tower.
SUSAN: They're moving so slowly.
TURLOUGH: Don't worry. Tegan will look after the old man.
SUSAN: If only we could make contact with the other Doctors.
SUSAN: What's that?
TURLOUGH: Oh, no.
SUSAN: Cybermen.
DOCTOR 2: Come along, Brigadier, come along. This way.
BRIGADIER: Damn it, Doctor, I'm just not built for this kind of thing any more.
DOCTOR 2: You never were. Cheer up, we're getting along very nicely.
BRIGADIER: Yeah.
DOCTOR: 2: We should be at the Tower very soon. The tunnel's rising all the time.
BRIGADIER: Is that supposed to cheer me up?
BRIGADIER: What was that?
DOCTOR 2: It sounded like something very large and very fierce, and probably very hungry. Come on.
SARAH: It's a dead end.
DOCTOR 3: No, it's not. Look.
SARAH: I can't go along there. I get vertigo.
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, I'll help you. Anyway, we can't go back.
SARAH: Why not? You've shaken the Cybermen off.
DOCTOR 3: They don't get tired, that's why not. And they never give up.
SARAH: Oh, no, no. I remember. Okay, well, let's go then. And if I don't fall off that path, I'll probably die of fright.
DOCTOR 3: Wait!
SARAH: What? What is it?
DOCTOR 3: Look. A Raston Warrior robot. The most perfect killing machine ever devised.
SARAH: It isn't armed.
DOCTOR 3: Quick, over there.
DOCTOR 3: Their armaments are built in, and sensors detect movement. Any movement.
SARAH: Anything else I shouldn't know?
DOCTOR 3: Yes. They move like lightning. 
SARAH: What's it doing?
DOCTOR 3: Playing with us.
DOCTOR: 3: Right, come on.
DOCTOR 3: Freeze, Sarah Jane. If you move, we're dead.
TURLOUGH: If only we could get away from here. Can you operate the controls?
SUSAN: Yes, but we're still trapped by the forcefield from the Tower.
TEGAN: Come on, Doc. You can make it.
DOCTOR 1: Well, of course I can, young woman. And kindly refrain from addressing me as Doc.
[The Guard Commander has brought a casket, and places it on the table.)
COMMANDER: As you can see, Lord President, the casket bears the Seal of Rassilon.
BORUSA: Where was this found?
COMMANDER: In the Castellan's room.
FLAVIA: Black Scrolls of Rassilon!
DOCTOR 5: Interesting. I thought they were out of print.
BORUSA: Don't touch, Doctor. This is forbidden knowledge from the Dark Tower.
BORUSA: You were taking no chances.
CASTELLAN: I am innocent. I have never seen that casket before.
BORUSA: Take him to Security and discover the truth. Commander, you are authorised to use the mind probe.
CASTELLAN: What? No, not the mind probe.
DOCTOR 5: Let me speak to him.
BORUSA: No, Doctor. The mind probe will give us all the answers we require.
DOCTOR 5: Was that really necessary?
COMMANDER: Well, as you can see, he was armed and trying to escape.
DOCTOR 5: It seems you have been saved the embarrassment of a trial.
BORUSA: And you have found your traitor, Doctor. Let us at least hope it will simplify the task of your other selves.
DOCTOR 5: Yes. Yes, I, I should be getting back to them.
BORUSA: Doctor, I admire your courage, but I cannot allow you to return. It will take some time to establish the Castellan's role in this affair. I need your help and advice.
DOCTOR 5: I can't abandon them.
BORUSA: Oh, I'm sure your other selves will be able to cope.
DOCTOR 5: Are they all in the Zone?
BORUSA: Yes, all but one, and he is trapped in the Vortex. Doctor, I'm sorry, but I must insist that you remain. Chancellor Flavia, would you escort the Doctor to a place of rest? I'm sure he must be exhausted.
BRIGADIER: Whatever that creature is, it's got our scent. It's hunting us.
DOCTOR 2: Oh! In here. Oh, oh!
BRIGADIER: Doctor, look!
BRIGADIER: Trapped. 
DOCTOR 2: Hold this. Must be something.
BRIGADIER: Hurry up, Doctor. It's trying to dig us out!
 
DOCTOR 2: Ah!
BRIGADIER: What was that?
DOCTOR 2: Pardon?
BRIGADIER: What was that?
DOCTOR 2: It's a Galactic Glitter.
DOCTOR 2: It's a Yeti!
BRIGADIER: Where did it come from?
DOCTOR 2: It must have been left over from the Games.
BRIGADIER: You maddened it!
DOCTOR 2: Well, at least it can't get at us.
BRIGADIER: Yes, and now we're trapped. Buried alive.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, I'm afraid we are. On the other hand, where there's a wind, there's a way.
DOCTOR 2: Well, I think we've arrived.
DOCTOR 2: I don't like this at all. Someone or something wants us to go inside. After you, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: No, no, after you, Doctor.
SUSAN: At least that terrible hammering's stopped.
TURLOUGH: Hmm. That's what's worrying me.
SUSAN: Look!
SUSAN: What's that they're carrying?
TURLOUGH: I don't know, but I would think their intention is to try and break in.
SARAH: Doctor, I don't think I can take much more of this.
DOCTOR 3: Hang on, Sarah Jane, hang on. I think we've got one hope.
DOCTOR 3: Now.
DOCTOR 3: Look what we've got, Sarah Jane. The Robot's extra arrows. At least we'll have something to have a fight with. Wait a minute, these might come in handy.
DOCTOR 3: Come on.
SARAH: Now what do we do, fly?
DOCTOR 3: What a splendid idea.
FLAVIA: You look so worried, Doctor. Your friends and your other selves will be safe, I am sure.
DOCTOR 5: At the moment I'm more concerned for the High Council. For Gallifrey.
FLAVIA: The traitor has been found.
DOCTOR 5: Has he? You know, I've known the Castellan too long. Oh, he was limited, a little narrow, but always fiercely loyal to his oath of office. Any mention of the Dark days filled him with horror. Now, you saw his reaction to the Black Scrolls. It wasn't that of a man discovered, but of sheer disbelief. No, I'm convinced the traitor is still at large.
FLAVIA: I will speak to the Commander who killed the Castellan. There may be much to be learned from him.
DOCTOR 5: Thank you. And I must speak to the Lord President.
SARAH: Doctor, Cybermen.
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, see if you can hold them off. I won't be a second.
SARAH: Yeah, right.
SARAH: Doctor? Missed.
DOCTOR 3: Right, that should do it.
SARAH: You're crazy. That'll never work.
DOCTOR 3: Well, maybe not. Can you think of a better suggestion? No? All right then, stand well back.
MASTER: Ever resourceful, Doctor.
DOCTOR 3: I've got you. Now, find a foot hold. Find any foot hold.
SARAH: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR 3: Have you got one?
SARAH: Yes.
DOCTOR 3: Right. Now, let go this hand
SARAH: I can't.
DOCTOR 3: Hold both loops in one hand. Both loops in one hand. I've got the other one. Right, come on. That's it. Now, find another foot hold. I've got you. Put it on that ledge. Can you find that ledge?
SARAH: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR 3: Good. All right, up you come. Up you come.
DOCTOR 3: Don't look down!
SARAH: I'm not looking, I'm not looking.
DOCTOR 3: Come on. Up. That's it.
SARAH: I did it! I did it!
DOCTOR 3: Come on. There you are. That's it.
DOCTOR 3: Well done. Enjoy the flight?
SARAH: Oh, great! Well, we're here. How do you reckon we get in?
DOCTOR 3: Through here, would you believe?
TEGAN: Now what? You're not suggesting we bang down the door, I hope.
DOCTOR 1: It looks very much like a bell to me.
TEGAN: It's an entry coder.
SUSAN: It's a bomb.
TURLOUGH: Big, isn't it?
DOCTOR 1: Don't be in such a hurry.
TEGAN: We have to pay to get in?
DOCTOR 1: It could cost you your life.
TEGAN: How long do you plan to play pitch and toss?
DOCTOR 1: Patience, child.
DOCTOR 1: Diabolical ingenuity! Nothing happens until you reach the fifth row, half way, and then the entire board becomes a death trap.
MASTER: Our ancestors had such a wonderful sense of humour.
DOCTOR 1: Do I know you, young man?
MASTER: Believe it or not, we were at the Academy together.
TEGAN: What do you want?
MASTER: To help.
TEGAN: That's the funniest thing I've heard all day.
MASTER: Believe what you like, I should advise you to hide. I've got very suspicious allies close behind me.
TEGAN: Allies?
TEGAN: Come on!
MASTER: Enter, but be careful. The fortress of the Time Lords is at your mercy.
CYBERMAN: Why was the main gate left unguarded?
MASTER: Oh, the Time Lords believe that no one could survive the Death Zone. It's that sort of woolly thinking that'll bring about their destruction.
MASTER: Do you fear an empty room? Shall I lead the way?
LEADER: You will cross to the far side.
MASTER: Very well.
MASTER: You see?
LEADER: Take the patrol across.
LEADER: You have betrayed us. Why?
MASTER: Betrayed? No. Oh, I, I might have misled you a little, but the safe path across the board changes with every journey.
LEADER: You show me the safe route, or I shall destroy you.
TEGAN: Wasn't that a little ruthless even for you?
MASTER: In one of the many wars on your miserable little planet, they used to drive sheep across minefields. The principle's the same.
TEGAN: Not quite. This minefield is still just as dangerous.
MASTER: Do you think so?
MASTER: Try it, Doctor, it's as easy as pie.
DOCTOR 1: What an extraordinary fellow. As easy as pie? As easy as pie?
TEGAN: That's what he said.
DOCTOR 1: No, he didn't! He said easy as pi. The Greek letter pi. Surely you know some basic mathematics, child?
TEGAN: Of course. The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is represented by the Greek letter pi, right?
DOCTOR 1: Exactly. You find the safe path by using the mathematical formula pi. Oh, but the application, the application. Now, let me see, now. Three point one four one five nine two six five. Yes, that's it! You stay there, child.
DOCTOR 1: Now!
TEGAN: I hope you've got your sums right.
DOCTOR 5: President Borusa, I. I thought you said the Lord President was in here.
GUARD: He is. Or at least he was.
DOCTOR 5: You're sure about that, are you?
GUARD: Positive. There isn't any way he could have left without my seeing him.
DOCTOR 5: No power. He couldn't have left that way. Inform Chancellor Flavia that the Lord President has disappeared, would you?
GUARD: Sir.
SARAH: I can't go on. I feel as if something were pushing me back.
DOCTOR 3: Yes. Yes, I can feel it too, Sarah. It's the mind of Rassilon. We must be nearing the tomb. Now, you've got to fight it. You must keep your mind under control.
SARAH: I can't. I feel as if something absolutely terrible were going to happen.
DOCTOR 3: Sit down here. Sit down. Rest for a moment. All right?
SARAH: Where are you going?
DOCTOR 3: I won't be a second.
SARAH: Well, don't be too long.
YATES: Doctor. Doctor, this way.
DOCTOR 3: Mike? Mike Yates? How did you get here?
YATES: Same way as you. Liz Shaw is here, too.
DOCTOR 3: Good heavens.
DOCTOR 3: Hello, Liz. Any more of you?
LIZ: Someone you should know very well. Come and see for yourself.
DOCTOR 3: Huh, not that little fellow in the checked trousers and the black frock coat.
LIZ: And more. There are five of you now.
DOCTOR 3: Oh, good grief.
YATES: And they're waiting for you.
DOCTOR 3: Yes, well, you wait here for a moment. I'll go and get Sarah.
YATES: I'll fetch her.
DOCTOR 3: No, I, er, I think I'll go, Mike. She's nervous enough as it is.
LIZ: Let Mike go. Your other selves need you urgently.
DOCTOR 3: No, I think I'll go, thanks.
SARAH: What's happening? Doctor? Doctor! Oh, there you are.
DOCTOR 3: Sarah?
SARAH: Sarah? Of course I am. What are you talking about? Listen, why did you leave me for so long? And what was that scream?
DOCTOR 3: They were just phantoms from the past.
SARAH: Yes, well, I'm in the present and I'm real.
DOCTOR 3: Yes. Yeah, you're real enough. Come on. 
TEGAN: Do you feel weird, Doctor?
DOCTOR 1: Full of strange fears and mysterious forebodings?
TEGAN: That's it.
DOCTOR 1: No, as a matter of fact, I don't. It's all illusion, child. We're close to the domain of Rassilon, whose mind is reaching out to attack us. Just ignore it, as I do.
TEGAN: How?
DOCTOR 1: Fear itself is largely an illusion. And at my age, there's little left to fear. Hmm. No, there's nothing here to harm us.
BRIGADIER: I don't like it, Doctor. I feel rather unwell. Touch of nausea, I think.
DOCTOR: 2: What you feel is fear, Brigadier, projecting from the mind of Rassilon.
BRIGADIER: Fear? 
WOMAN : Doctor, help me!
DOCTOR 2: No. It may be a trap. I'll go and see. You wait here.
BRIGADIER: Certainly not. I'm coming with you.
DOCTOR 2: Oh, very well, but don't get in the way.
DOCTOR 2: Take this.
BRIGADIER: What was that?
DOCTOR 2: We'll go and see.
BRIGADIER: Good grief!
DOCTOR 2: Jamie! Zoe!
JAMIE: Stay back, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Why, what's happening?
ZOE: Don't come any closer. There's a force field.
DOCTOR 2: A force field? We'll soon see about that.
JAMIE: No, don't, Doctor. If the force field is disturbed, it'll destroy us.
ZOE: You must go back.
BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, what are we going to do?
DOCTOR 2: Get them out of it.
JAMIE: No, no, please don't, Doctor.
ZOE: Oh, go back. Save yourselves.
DOCTOR 2: I can't. I can't leave you there.
ZOE: You must.
BRIGADIER: We could find another way into the tomb area.
DOCTOR 2: But Zoe and Jamie would still be trapped.
JAMIE: The Brigadier's right.
DOCTOR 2: Or would they? Just a minute. It's a matter of memory.
ZOE: Stay away!
DOCTOR 2: Why? I can't harm you.
JAMIE: One step nearer and we're dead!
DOCTOR 2: You can't kill illusions.
JAMIE: Brigadier!
DOCTOR 2: You're not real. When you were returned to your own people, the Time Lords erased your memory of the period you spent with me. So how do you know who we are? Answer!
BRIGADIER: They're gone.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, yes, it's sad.
BRIGADIER: I still don't like it, Doctor. I don't fully understand why we're here.
DOCTOR 2: You want to get home?
BRIGADIER: Of course.
DOCTOR 2: That is why we are here. Have faith, Brigadier. Have I ever led you astray?
BRIGADIER: On many occasions.
DOCTOR 2: Yes, well, this will be the exception. Come along.
DOCTOR 5: The Harp of Rassilon. I never knew he was musical. Borusa either for that matter.
DOCTOR 5: Interesting. A musical key. A combination of notes. A tune.
DOCTOR 1: Ah, there you are at last, dear fellow. What kept you?
DOCTOR 3: What kept me? Of all the confounded arrogance.
DOCTOR 1: Never mind, never mind, you can tell me later. Come and take a look at this.
DOCTOR 3: What is it?
TEGAN: Tegan.
SARAH: Sarah.
DOCTOR 3: Hmm. Fascinating.
DOCTOR 1: What happened to the little fellow?
DOCTOR 2: The little fellow is perfectly all right, thank you very much. Of course I'm here. You don't imagine anything you two could do could stump me, do you? Let's have a look. What's this?
TEGAN + SARAH: Brigadier?
BRIGADIER: Good heavens. It's Miss Smith, isn't it. Miss Jovanka. Don't ask me how we got here. It was like a cross between Guy Fawkes and Hallowe'en.
DOCTOR 3: Lethbridge Stewart? Oh, my dear fellow. How very nice to see you again.
BRIGADIER: Great heavens, you as well? Though I can't exactly say it's nice to be here. Do you know, I was enjoying
DOCTOR 3: You'll have to excuse me, old chap. We've got a very important inscription to translate and I think they'll get it all wrong without me.
BRIGADIER: Typical. Absolutely typical.
SARAH: Oh, I know, I know. Drag you through time and space without so much as a bye or leave, then leave you out when things get interesting.
TEGAN: My version isn't any better.
SARAH: Which one's yours?
DOCTOR 2: So, that's what it's all about. I never dreamed.
DOCTOR 1: It changes nothing, absolutely nothing. We lower the forcefield, get the young fellow back from Gallifrey and all go home. This doesn't concern us. It mustn't.
TEGAN: What does the inscription say?
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'd quite like to know as well.
SARAH: Yes, we've all been through a great deal to get here.
DOCTOR 1: You. Tell them.
DOCTOR 2: It's Old High Gallifreyan, the ancient language of the Time Lords. Not many people understand it these days.
THE DOCTORS: Fortunately, I do.
BRIGADIER: All very interesting, I'm sure, Doctors, but what does it say?
DOCTOR 3: That this is the Tomb of Rassilon, where Rassilon lies in eternal sleep.
DOCTOR 2: It also says that anyone who's got this far has passed many dangers and shown great courage and determination. What does this bit mean?
DOCTOR 3: To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose.
DOCTOR 2: I know what it says. What does it mean?
DOCTOR 1: It also promises that whoever takes the ring from Rassilon's hand and puts it on shall get the reward he seeks.
SARAH: What reward?
DOCTOR 1: Immortality.
BRIGADIER: What, live forever? Never die?
DOCTOR 1: That is what the word means, young man.
SARAH: But that's impossible.
DOCTOR 3: Apparently not.
DOCTOR 2: It seems Rassilon possesses it now, and is willing to share it with whoever takes the ring.
MASTER: Thank you, gentlemen, that is exactly what I needed to know. I came here to help you. A little unwillingly, but I came. My services were scorned, my help refused. Now I shall help myself to immortality.
DOCTOR 1: Out of the question.
DOCTOR 3: You're hardly a suitable candidate.
DOCTOR 2: For anything.
MASTER: The decision is scarcely yours. Killing you once was never enough for me, Doctor. How, how gratifying to do it three times over.
BRIGADIER: Nice to see you again.
CYBERMAN: Leader, the bombs are ready.
LEADER: Excellent. Prepare for detonation.
CYBERMAN: Your orders are to move back.
CYBERMAN 2: Lieutenant.
TURLOUGH: Do you realise what they're up to?
SUSAN: What are we going to do we do now?
TURLOUGH: Die, it seems.
DOCTOR 5: Well, if it is a tune, what could it be? A tune like, a tune like. A tune like the one that's been under my nose all the time perhaps.
BORUSA: Welcome, Doctor.
DOCTOR 5: Lord President.
BORUSA: You show very little surprise. Can it be that you suspected me?
DOCTOR 5: Not at first. Your little charade fooled me for a while.
BORUSA: Yes, it was rather neat, wasn't it? Such a pity about the Castellan, but then I needed someone to use for a diversion.
DOCTOR 5: Oh, Borusa. What's happened to you?
BORUSA: You know how long I have ruled Gallifrey, Doctor, both openly or behind the scenes.
DOCTOR 5: Oh, you've done great service. It was only right you should become President.
BORUSA: President? How long before I must retire, my work half done. If I could continue
DOCTOR 5: Oh, I understand. You want to be President throughout all your remaining regenerations.
BORUSA: Oh, you underestimate my ambition, Doctor. I shall be President Eternal, and rule forever.
DOCTOR 5: Immortality? Oh, that's impossible, even for a Time Lord.
BORUSA: Rassilon achieved it. Timeless perpetual bodily regeneration. True immortality! Rassilon lives, Doctor. He cannot die. He is immortal.
DOCTOR 3: Well, I've reversed the polarity of the neutron flow, so the Tardis should be free of the forcefield now.
DOCTOR 2: I'll try to get through to the Capitol.
CYBERMAN: All is prepared.
LEADER: Excellent.
LEADER: Detonate!
SUSAN: They made it! They made it!
TURLOUGH: Are we going to the Tower?
SUSAN: Must be, we're on preset co-ordinates.
BORUSA: Immortal, Doctor. Before Rassilon was bound, he left clues for his successor, whom he knew would follow him. Oh, I have discovered much, Doctor. This Game control room, the casket with the Scrolls, the Coronet of Rassilon.
DOCTOR 5: But not the final secret.
BORUSA: The secret of immortality, Doctor? It lies in the Dark Tower, in the Tomb of Rassilon itself. There are many dangers, many traps.
DOCTOR 5: So, you sent me to the Zone to deal with them for you.
BORUSA: I gave you companions to help, an old enemy to fight. Well, it's a game within a game.
DOCTOR 5: Only you botched it, didn't you? One of my selves is trapped in a time vortex, endangering my very existence.
BORUSA: Oh, you need have no fear, Doctor. Your temporal stability will be maintained. I need you to serve me.
DOCTOR 5: Oh, I would not serve you.
BORUSA: You have no choice, Doctor. I wear the coronet of Rassilon.
DOCTOR 5: And very fetching it is, too.
BORUSA: It emphasises my will and allows me to control the minds of other people. You bow down before me, Doctor.
BORUSA: Come, Doctor.
BORUSA: It's time to go, Doctor. My immortality awaits.
DOCTOR 2: Can you hear me, old fellow?
DOCTOR 2 : Calling the Capitol, calling the Capitol. This is the Doctor speaking. Well, one of them. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Doctor? Is there anybody there? Calling the Capitol.
DOCTOR 5: Yes, I'm here.
DOCTOR 2 : Ah, there I am. I mean, there you are.
DOCTOR 2: We've reached the Tower. We're all safe. The barriers are down and the Tardis is here. And I say, we've made the most extraordinary discovery.
DOCTOR 5 : I know what you have discovered. Do not transmit further. Stay where you are and touch nothing. President Borusa is arriving to take full charge.
DOCTOR 2: Touch nothing, indeed? Who does he think he is.
DOCTOR 1: He didn't want us to mention the Ring of Rassilon. Natural enough.
DOCTOR 3: Something's wrong, you know.
DOCTOR 2: You haven't changed. Still finding menace in your own shadow.
DOCTOR 1: I feel the same.
DOCTOR 2: Oh. Well, we shall soon see, won't we.
TEGAN: Doctor, are you all right?
BORUSA: Be silent. Be silent, all of you. Do not move or speak until I give you leave.
BORUSA: Gentlemen, I owe you my thanks. You have served the purpose for which I brought you here.
DOCTOR 3: You brought us here?
DOCTOR 2: He's after the Ring of Rassilon. He wants immortality.
DOCTOR 3: And you were the one who didn't sense anything was wrong.
DOCTOR 1: He's a renegade. No better than that villain down there.
DOCTOR 2: We can't allow it, you know.
DOCTOR 3: The Tomb was sealed for the best of reasons.
DOCTOR 1: And as soon as we're back to our own time streams, it must be sealed again. Permanently!
DOCTOR 2: Doctor, we need you. Join us.
DOCTOR 1: He can't. Some kind of mind lock. Fight it, my boy, fight it. Concentrate. We must be one.
DOCTOR 5: You see, Borusa? Together, we're a match for you.
BORUSA: Perhaps, but you will never overcome me.
DOCTOR 5: We don't need to. Soon, Chancellor Flavia will be here with her guards, or can you overcome the whole High Council?
BORUSA: Why not? I am Lord President of Gallifrey and you are the notorious renegades. We shall see who is believed.
RASSILON : This is the Game of Rassilon.
DOCTOR 1: No, wait, my boy. That was the voice of Rassilon. It's out of our hands now.
RASSILON : Who comes to disturb Rassilon?
BORUSA: I am Borusa, Lord President of Gallifrey.
RASSILON: Why have you come here?
BORUSA: I come to claim that which is promised.
RASSILON: You seek immortality?
BORUSA: I do.
RASSILON: Be sure. Be very sure. Even now, it is not too late to turn back.
BORUSA: I am sure.
RASSILON: And these others?
BORUSA: These are my servants.
RASSILON: Is this so?
DOCTOR 3: It most certainly is not.
DOCTOR 2: Don't believe him.
DOCTOR 5: It's nonsense.
DOCTOR 1: Don't listen to them, Lord Rassilon. President Borusa speaks the truth.
RASSILON: You believe that Borusa deserves the immortality he seeks?
DOCTOR 1: Indeed I do.
RASSILON: He shall have it. Take the Ring.
RASSILON: You claim immortality, Lord Borusa. You will not turn back?
BORUSA: Never!
RASSILON: Then put on the Ring. Others have come to claim immortality through the ages. It was given to them, as it shall be given to you.
RASSILON: Your place is prepared, Lord President Borusa.
BORUSA: No! No!
RASSILON: And what of you, Doctors? Do you claim immortality too?
DOCTORS: That's very kind of you. No. No, no thank you!
DOCTOR 5: No, my Lord. All we ask is that we be returned to our proper place in time and space.
RASSILON: It shall be done.
DOCTOR 5: One of us is trapped.
RASSILON: I know. He too shall be freed.
RASSILON: So shall the one who is bound. His sins will find their punishment in due time.
RASSILON: It is time for your other selves to depart. Let them make their farewells and go. You have chosen wisely, Doctor. Farewell.
DOCTOR 5: Did you know what would happen?
DOCTOR 1: Hmm? Oh, I'm so sorry. I suddenly realised what the old proverb meant. To lose is to win and he who wins shall lose. It was all part of Rassilon's trap to find out who wanted immortality and put him out of the way. He knew very well that immortality was a curse, not a blessing.
DOCTOR 5: Well, now it seems we must part, just as I was getting to know me.
DOCTOR 2: So, you're the latest model, hmm?
DOCTOR 5: Yes, and the most agreeable.
DOCTOR 2: Certainly the most impudent.
DOCTOR 3: And our dress sense hasn't improved much, has it?
DOCTOR 1: Neither our manners. Well, goodbye, my boy. You did quite well, quite well. It's reassuring to know that my future is in safe hands. Come along, Susan.
SUSAN: Goodbye, everybody.
ALL: Goodbye.
DOCTOR 2: Time to go, Brigadier. Well, goodbye.
DOCTOR 5: Goodbye.
DOCTOR 2: Goodbye, fancy pants.
DOCTOR 3: Scarecrow.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, don't you want your coat?
DOCTOR 2: Bring it along, would you, Brigadier?
BRIGADIER: Certainly. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR 5: Goodbye.
BRIGADIER: Doctors.
DOCTOR 3: Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: Splendid fellows, all of you.
DOCTOR 3: Well, goodbye, my dear chap. I must say, I've had the time of my lives. Haven't we, Sarah Jane?
SARAH: Have we? Well, I only have one life and I think I've had too much already. Goodbye. Er, yes, it was really nice meeting you.
DOCTOR 3: Thank you, Sarah Jane, it was nice meeting you, too.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR 3: I'll explain later.
SARAH: Oh. Fine.
DOCTOR 5: I'm definitely not the man I was, thank goodness.
TEGAN: Are we all going home together?
DOCTOR 5: Watch.
DOCTOR 5: Temporal fission. Old Rassilon is very clever.
FLAVIA: You are safe, Doctor. I feared President Borusa had. Where is President Borusa?
DOCTOR 5: Unavailable. It seems the legend about Rassilon is true.
FLAVIA: You must make a full statement to the High Council.
DOCTOR: Oh, must I?
FLAVIA: It can form part of your inaugural address.
DOCTOR 5: My what?
FLAVIA: Doctor, you have evaded your responsibilities for far too long. The disqualification of President Borusa leaves a gap at the very summit of the Time Lord hierarchy. There is only one who can take this place. Yet again, it is my duty and my pleasure to inform you that the full Council has exercised its emergency powers to appoint you to the position of President, to take office immediately.
DOCTOR 5: Oh, no.
FLAVIA: This is a summons no Time Lord dare refuse. To disobey the will of the High Council will attract the severest penalties.
DOCTOR 5: Very well, Chancellor Flavia. You will return to Gallifrey immediately and summon the High Council. You have full deputy powers until I return. I shall travel in my Tardis.
FLAVIA: Oh, but Doctor
DOCTOR 5: You will address me by my proper title. I am President, am I not? You will obey my commands.  Into the Tardis.  You will escort Chancellor Flavia back to her duties.
FLAVIA: Doctor, wait!
DOCTOR 5: Hold tight.
TEGAN: It'll soon be goodbye, then.
DOCTOR 5: Will it?
TURLOUGH: Well, you're off to Gallifrey to be President. I suppose your Time Lord subjects will find a Tardis that really works and get us both home?
DOCTOR 5: Who said anything about Gallifrey?
TURLOUGH: You told Chancellor Flavia
DOCTOR 5: I told her she had full deputy powers until I returned.
TEGAN: You're not going back?
DOCTOR 5: You know, sometimes, Tegan, you take my breath away.
TURLOUGH: Er, won't the Time Lords be very angry?
DOCTOR 5: Furious.
TEGAN: You mean you're deliberately choosing to go on the run from your own people in a rackety old Tardis?
DOCTOR 5: Why not? After all, that's how it all started.
