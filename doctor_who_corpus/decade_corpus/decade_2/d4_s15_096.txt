Underworld
Part One
LEELA: We've stopped.
K9: Affirmative.
LEELA: We've stopped dead.
K9: Negative dead.
LEELA: Oh. Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hmm?
LEELA: We've stopped.
DOCTOR: Really?
LEELA: I mean, everything's still working. Nothing's gone wrong, has it?
DOCTOR: Not so far, no.
LEELA: Then why have we stopped? Why are we not going anywhere?
DOCTOR: That's intensely interesting. Do you realise there's nowhere to go?
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: We're on the edge of the cosmos, the frontiers of creation, the boundary between what is and isn't, or isn't yet, anyway. Don't you think that's interesting?
LEELA: I suppose so.
DOCTOR: What? I feel just like a goldfish looking out on a new world.
LEELA: A goldfish?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: But it's just black nothing out there, and being out here on our own is just, just nothing.
K9: We are not alone.
DOCTOR: Nothing?
LEELA: Nothing.
DOCTOR: Nothing? It's magnificent. Any minute, any second, a whole new world could be born and we'd be the first
K9: We are not the first.
DOCTOR: Shush. We'd be the first intelligent and semi-intelligent beings to witness the spectacle.
K9: We are not alone.
DOCTOR: What's he saying?
LEELA: I don't know.
K9: We are not the first. We are not alone. Receptors indicate pulsing. Pulsing characteristic of ion drive system. The inference therefore would be spacecraft in vicinity.
DOCTOR: Shush, shush. Where, K9, where?
K9: Thirty four seven zero one seventeen fifty zero five.
DOCTOR: Thirty four seven? That's beyond visual aid range.
DOCTOR: Listen, Leela. Listen! Ion drive, or I'm a budgie's cousin.
K9: Affirmative ion drive. Family grouping negative.
DOCTOR: Shut up, K9. Shut up.
LEELA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: I can tell him to shut up if I want to.
LEELA: No, no, no. Look!
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: Leela.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: That's a spiral nebula. A gas cloud coalescing to form a whole new star system. It's sucking in everything around it like a gigantic whirlpool, including us.
LEELA: Is that good?
DOCTOR: No, it's bad. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Time to get out of here. K9, escape coordinates.
K9: Thirty four seven zero one seventeen fifty zero five.
LEELA: But isn't that where the ion drive is?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes!
TALA: Nothing up front, Captain. Only the spiral nebula on two four zero.
JACKSON: Right, Tala. Stay on watch. Orfe, check the nebula, two four zero.
ORFE: Two four zero, checking. Too far off, sir.
JACKSON: Then what was it? Tala, take out the nebula. Herrick?
HERRICK: Nothing on targeter, sir. There's no blip, nothing.
JACKSON: Right, let's think it again. It wasn't inside, it wasn't outside, none of us saw anything, we've got no trace, but we all heard it, didn't we?
ORFE + HERRICK: Yes, sir.
JACKSON: Let's hear it again, Orfe.
JACKSON: Now, was that sound generated inside the ship or outside? Anybody ever hear anything like that before?
ORFE + HERRICK: No, sir.
JACKSON: Run it through ident.
ORFE: Sir. Ident running, sir.
LEELA: The air is stale.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
LEELA: The door's locked. Nobody's been in here for years.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Made in Minyos. Made in Minyos? Got it! The Minyans of Minyos. This could be a Minyan patrol vessel. Have you ever heard of the Flying Dutchman?
LEELA: No.
DOCTOR: Pity, I've often wanted to know who he was. K9, could you give me a date on that, do you think?
K9: Isotope decay rate indicates one hundred K range.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what I thought.
LEELA: Me too.
DOCTOR: That's a hundred thousand years old. The Minyan civilisation was destroyed a hundred thousand years ago, on the other side of the universe.
ORFE: Ident concluded, sir. Signal identified as relative dimensional stabiliser in materialisation phase as used in
JACKSON: As used in what? Orfe, as used in what?
ORFE: As used in the time ships of the gods.
DOCTOR: It was what happened on Minyos that led to our policy of non-intervention.
LEELA: Huh?
DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, the Minyans thought of us as gods, you see, which was all very flattering and we were new at space-time explorations, so we thought we could help. We gave them medical and scientific aid, better communications, better weapons.
LEELA: What happened?
DOCTOR: Kicked up out at gunpoint. Then they went to war with each other, learnt how to split the atom, discovered the toothbrush and finally split the planet.
LEELA: So this ship must have got away before the planet was destroyed.
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: That was a hundred thousand years ago. Nobody lives for a hundred thousand years. Do they?
ORFE: If it is the gods, they'll help us. Help us with the Quest.
HERRICK: Help us? Like they helped us before? Helped to destroy ourselves. No, if it is the gods, and there's no way of telling because that ident is as worn out as everything else on board the ship, but if it is the gods then they're the reason for it all.
JACKSON: The reason for all what, Herrick?
HERRICK: Well, everything! The Quest. They're playing games with us. Oh, they do, you know. The gods use us for their sport. We should have wiped them out when we had the chance.
ORFE: We brought our own destruction on ourselves.
HERRICK: Pacifist! If I get one of them in my sights again, then I'll dematerialise him for good. If they're on board this ship, then I'll sniff them out!
JACKSON: Herrick! Sit down.
HERRICK: Sir? Yes, sir.
JACKSON: Time for the next sweep, Tala. Set up for the next sweep.
TALA: Yes, sir.
ORFE: Two four zero and cubit.
TALA: Four zero and cubit.
ORFE: It's going to take us close to the nebula, Captain.
JACKSON: I know, but we have no choice. The Quest is the Quest.
ORFE: The Quest is the Quest.
DOCTOR: You all right, K9?
K9: Affirmative.
LEELA: What happened?
DOCTOR: Trouble.
LEELA: I know that.
DOCTOR: Blast the door, K9.
K9: Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction. Blaster malfunction.
LEELA: What is this thing?
DOCTOR: It's a Liebermann laser. Fires charged particles along a laser beam. Don't ever play with strange weapons, Leela.
LEELA: No, Doctor.
DOCTOR: And switch the safety catch off.
LEELA: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Shush.
LEELA: Shush.
DOCTOR: Shush.
JACKSON: Take her off the flight deck!
HERRICK: Yes, sir.
JACKSON: Levelled out.
ORFE: Nothing on rudder, sir. She's stuck, stuck on maximum.
JACKSON: Do what you can. Can you shut down on drive?
ORFE: We can, but it won't reduce her speed. She's already reached maximum.
JACKSON: Reverse thrust?
ORFE: Tear the ship in two, sir.
JACKSON: Right, give her all you can on left main and auxiliaries. Shut down on all right propulsion units.
ORFE: Yes, sir.
JACKSON: We've got to veer off before we hit the gravity field or that thing will suck us down like a whirlpool!
JACKSON: How is she?
HERRICK: She's not good, sir. She's gone past her regeneration point deliberately, just like all the others.
JACKSON: None of us likes it, but the Quest is the Quest.
DOCTOR: Anything I can do? How do you do?
JACKSON: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
HERRICK: How did you get here?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, through the door.
HERRICK: He's one of them!
LEELA: Stop!
HERRICK: See, sir? They're on board. I warned you, they're on board!
JACKSON: Orfe.
LEELA: Thank you.
HERRICK: Go on, get back! Get back to that panel. And you, too, get back. I'll take them out now, sir. Just one quick blast.
JACKSON: Calmly, Herrick. Wait for the word of command. Just a minute. You, Doctor, you said you wanted to help?
DOCTOR: Yes, if I can, yes.
JACKSON: Are you a Time Lord?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm a Time Lord.
HERRICK: It was lies, all lies. He said he was a doctor!
JACKSON: Orfe.
HERRICK: Thank you, Orfe.
HERRICK: I'm sorry, friend.
DOCTOR: That's all right. What happened to her?
JACKSON: She collapsed. We know what to do.
DOCTOR: Well, if you know what to do, why don't you do it?
JACKSON: Herrick, take Tala to regen now.
HERRICK: Yes, sir.
LEELA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
LEELA: His name is Orfe.
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: What a beautiful name.
JACKSON: Orfe, look after her then get back to your post.
ORFE: Yes, sir.
LEELA: Orfe.
DOCTOR: So you did develop the pacifier.
JACKSON: Very few, and too late.
DOCTOR: How long does the effect last?
JACKSON: Is she a primitive?
DOCTOR: Oh, very, very.
JACKSON: Well, several hours then.
DOCTOR: Really.
JACKSON: You say you're a doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes.
JACKSON: Of medicine?
DOCTOR: Oh, many things, many things.
JACKSON: Crystalocybernetics?
DOCTOR: My dear chap, what's the problem?
JACKSON: That is.
JACKSON: And this. It's worn out.
DOCTOR: How much time have we got?
JACKSON: We haven't. We're already in the gravitational field. We could burn our way out if we had the main systems working. That's the problem. Terminal cores are fragmented.
DOCTOR: Mind if I take a look?
JACKSON: We've been in mission a hundred thousand years, Doctor. The ship wasn't designed for that. Neither were we. Each one of us has regenerated a thousand times. Have you any idea what that means?
DOCTOR: Well, I've been through it two or three times. Not pleasant.
JACKSON: A thousand times plus, Doctor. None of us wants to go on, but we must. The Quest is the Quest. But now we're like the ship, degenerating faster than we can regenerate ourselves. Not the body, not the mind, but the spirit.
JACKSON: A ship of ghosts, Doctor, going on and on and unable to remember why.
DOCTOR: It's had it, I'm afraid.
JACKSON: What?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
JACKSON: Then it's over. It's over at last.
DOCTOR: Tell me about this Quest.
JACKSON: It was a missing spaceship, the P7E. We get signals from it, we track it and lose it, track it and lose it.
DOCTOR: But surely after all this time there won't be any survivors.
JACKSON: Probably not.
DOCTOR: So?
JACKSON: It was carrying colonists.
DOCTOR: Ah. Does the P7E have regeneration too?
JACKSON: No, the P7E was carrying something much more important, at least to us. The future of the Minyan race, our genetic inheritance.
DOCTOR: A race bank. Hmm.
JACKSON: The chance for a new people on a new planet. Minyos Two. Well, that was the theory.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, it seems a pity to give up now, after all you've been through. Do you know, there just might be the ghost of a chance, if it's at all compatible.
JACKSON: Compatible?
DOCTOR: You'll see. K9? Where are you, boy? Come on, heel! K9!
JACKSON: What's this?
DOCTOR: He's my second best friend, aren't you, K9?
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Try this.
DOCTOR: Here, K9, feel anything?
DOCTOR: Right. From now on, you're in charge. K9, we want to avoid the nebula. It's all yours, K9. You're on. What?
K9: On line. In link up. Rudder control positive. Accelerator positive. Ident nav control. All systems ready.
K9: Stand by for G loading. All systems positive.
ORFE: We made it. We've made it, Captain!
DOCTOR: Well done, K9. What?
JACKSON: Tala. Regen was all right, after all. Don't do that again. I know you're exhausted, but the Quest
TALA: Is the Quest. Yes, Captain.
JACKSON: Right, everybody back on station. Tala, take over from Orfe. Continue with the sweep.
HERRICK: Is it a trick, Captain?
JACKSON: I don't care what it is. We've got full power on all stations for the first time in I don't know how long.
HERRICK: But you know what they're like. He's just setting us up for something worse.
JACKSON: Orfe, bring in that signal boost. Tala, two four zero and cubit. Herrick, on tracking.
HERRICK: Sir.
JACKSON: Full power on two!
DOCTOR: Leela.
LEELA: What a beautiful man.
DOCTOR: Leela! Leela, listen to me. You're primitive. Wild, warlike, aggressive and tempestuous, and bad tempered too.
LEELA: I am?
DOCTOR: Yes. You're a warrior leader from a warrior tribe. Courageous, indomitable, implacable, impossible
LEELA: Right, that's far enough! You stay where
DOCTOR: Oh, put it away. You were pacified.
LEELA: Pass?
DOCTOR: Pacified.
LEELA: Pacified? Who did it, hmm? Who did it? I'll kill them. I'll kill them! It was him, wasn't it? 
ORFE: It was me.
LEELA: You?
DOCTOR: It's all right, Leela.
LEELA: You're laughing at me.
DOCTOR: No.
LEELA: You're all laughing at me. I'll smash your stupid grins off your stupid faces.
HERRICK: Signal on tracker two seven, sir!
JACKSON: Boost and ident, Orfe.
ORFE : Boost and ident, sir. That's it! That's P7E!
JACKSON: Lock on nav system. Keep tracking. What bearing?
ORFE: Two four zero, sir.
TALA: Four zero, thrust on maximum.
JACKSON: This time we've got a chance. Don't lose her, Tala. Don't lose her now.
DOCTOR: Listen, Jackson. Listen.
JACKSON: Quiet, please. Don't lose her now, Tala.
DOCTOR: Jackson, two four zero takes us right back into the nebula.
JACKSON: That's right. If that's where P7E is, that's where we go.
DOCTOR: But that could mean destruction.
JACKSON: No, Doctor, it'll mean the end of the Quest. If P7E went in there, so can we.
DOCTOR: But P7E didn't go in there. She couldn't have! She must have been there at the beginning and the nebula formed around her.
HERRICK: How does he know that?
DOCTOR: It's elementary physics. The still centre of a raging storm. P7E might be in there and she might be safe, but if you go in after her, it could mean destruction.
JACKSON: Doctor, if P7E is there, we must find her. That is our purpose. Destruction is a chance we take. The Quest is the Quest.
DOCTOR: Jackson, I can't allow that.
JACKSON: You can't allow it? You have no choice.
DOCTOR: What? K9, stop.
LEELA: Let him go!
JACKSON: Don't move.
K9: Query stop. Stop what? Instruction, please. Instruction.
JACKSON: Doctor, tell it we're going on.
DOCTOR: We're going on, K9.
K9: Affirmative.
JACKSON: Right, everybody up on the flight deck. Move.
HERRICK: You. Quickly.
JACKSON: Herrick, carbo-magnetic seat lock.
HERRICK: Sir.
JACKSON: Now, Tala, don't lose that signal. Don't lose it now.
JACKSON: Heat shield.
DOCTOR: Jackson, listen to me. This is hopeless.
LEELA: What's happening?
DOCTOR: We're being sucked through a layer of meteorites. They're smashing us to pieces.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: I said they're smashing us to piece
LEELA:  They are?
JACKSON: Damage report?
TALA: I think we've lost left and right ancillaries.
ORFE: And solar sail, plus all external antennae, sir.
HERRICK: The hull's taken a battering, but the self-sealer pumps are still working.
TALA: Main drive's positive.
ORFE: On course and signal holding.
TALA: Major systems functional.
JACKSON: Right, we go on. Lower heat shield. Take her on manual.
ORFE: Signal fading, sir.
TALA: No visibility. We're losing acceleration.
JACKSON: Full boost on both.
TALA: Full power and we're still slowing down.
ORFE: Signal going. Signal gone.
TALA: We've lost acceleration. Maintaining orbital speed. No acceleration. We're drifting.
JACKSON: Main systems functional. Then why aren't we moving?
DOCTOR: Don't you know? What's the normal hull thickness?
JACKSON: Three metres twenty.
DOCTOR: K9! Present hull thickness?
K9 : Hull thickness seventy metres, increasing.
JACKSON: Seventy metres!
DOCTOR: We're being turned into a planet.
JACKSON: But that's impossible!
DOCTOR: No, it's not impossible, Jackson. It's simply gravity. This ship's a large, heavy object surrounded by smaller, lighter, objects. Our gravitational pull is greater than theirs. We attract them. They stick to us. It all snowballs.
K9 : Eighty metres, increasing.
DOCTOR: We're being buried alive. If it wasn't for this layer of debris, the asteroid belt would have smashed us to pieces. Still, you can't have everything, can you.
HERRICK: Look at him, sir. He's just laughing at us.
JACKSON: Is there a way out?
DOCTOR: I don't know. You could try the laser cannon.
JACKSON: Blast a tunnel and blow our way out on ion drive?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
JACKSON: Tala?
TALA: It'll take up all our reserve fuel.
JACKSON: It's either that or we're stuck here for the rest of eternity. We'll try it. Herrick?
HERRICK: Sir. Fire one. Fire two.
K9 : Ninety metres, increasing. Ninety five metres, increasing.
DOCTOR: Carry on, Herrick.
TALA: Skin's overheating. The forward hull's buckling.
DOCTOR: Carry on, Herrick.
TALA: We're melting our own hull.
DOCTOR: Herrick, keep on!
HERRICK: It's no use! The cannon's disintegrating!
Part Two
K9 : One hundred metres. Penetration. You have penetration.
JACKSON: Now, Tala. Full acceleration.
DOCTOR: That's the P7E.
TALA: Captain, the fuel's going.
JACKSON: What do you mean? That's a planet.
DOCTOR: That's where the signal's coming from.
JACKSON: Where?
DOCTOR: Right in the middle. The planet formed around it.
TALA: Captain, the fuel's gone.
JACKSON: That's it, then. There's nothing else we can do.
LEELA: Sit down! We're going to crash!
DOCTOR: Full speed!
K9 : Mach twelve. Impact in eleven seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
DOCTOR: Hold tight.
K9 : Four, three.
LEELA: Hold tight?
K9 : Two, one, zero. Stand by for impact.
DOCTOR: You can relax now. Relax, everyone. It's a soft planet in the process of formation. Only the core will be solid and with any luck this stuff should slow us down so we don't hit it with too much of a bang.
K9: Two hundred and fifty kilometres below planet surface. Speed mach point three, decreasing.
JACKSON: Orfe, the signal. Tune in on the signal!
ORFE: That's it!
JACKSON: We've got it!
DOCTOR: Fascinating. The Quest and nothing but the Quest.
ORFE: Contact. R1C to P7E. R1C to P7E.
JACKSON: We must be right on top of it!
MAN: The sky is falling!
IDMON: Help, damn you. Help us!
SON: They won't, father, they won't. Don't say any more.
IDMON: Then may the sky fall on them. May the sky fall on your families.
IDAS: No, father. The guards. They'll tell the guards.
IDMON: May the sky fall on yours as it has on mine.
IDAS: Please, father, dig.
IDMON: My children, my children.
TARN: Skyfall on eight and a Trog making trouble.
RASK: Many dead?
TARN: Not enough. There were two more bursts yesterday. What we need is a good sacrifice. Trogs always work harder after a good sacrifice.
RASK: I'll take a patrol out, pick him up.
ORFE: Ready, sir?
DOCTOR: Well, Jackson?
JACKSON: Right, Orfe. Open up.
DOCTOR: Solid rock?
JACKSON: Yes, solid rock. Igneous hematite, I should imagine.
DOCTOR: Igneous hematite? That means we're at the core.
LEELA: But I thought planets had fire in the middle.
DOCTOR: Well, old ones like Earth, yes, but new ones have a molten slurry round a solid core. All we have to do is burrow our way out of here and enter the core.
LEELA: Oh, is that all.
JACKSON: But we've no power, no energy source to recharge.
DOCTOR: I don't know about that. What about a shield gun?
JACKSON: Yes, a shield gun. Herrick, jump to it.
HERRICK: Sir.
IDMON: We all know we're slaves to the guards as the guards are slaves to the Seers.
IDAS: Don't say any more, father.
IDMON: And the Seers to the Oracle. We're all slaves, all of us, of every class. Slaves to the Oracle.
IDAS: They're coming, father.
IDMON: But we all know the answer, don't we? We all know the answer because it was prophesied. And the answer is to escape!
IDAS: It isn't, father.
IDMON: Escape through there, through the sky to the stars!
RASK: Now!
IDMON: No, Idas. Idas, run! Run!
RASK: Two of you, after him!
RASK: Heresy! Treachery! Incitement to escape.
IDMON: There's nothing you can do to me now, Rask.
RASK: You know the penalty, Idmon.
RASK: Stop, Trog, or I'll fire.
RASK: Suspect sighted on eight, moving nine.
DOCTOR: Herrick!
DOCTOR: Give it a blast. Hold it. Like that, I think.
HERRICK: Fire!
HERRICK: We're through, Captain! It looks like a cavern or a tunnel or something.
TARN: Skyfall on nine. Rask, we have skyfall on nine.
RASK : Approaching nine.
TARN: Remain in position till skyfall investigated.
HERRICK: It's hacked out of solid rock.
JACKSON: Hacked out by what, I wonder? Get down, Herrick!
TARN: Minor fall. No structural collapse. I'll check out the rest, then you go ahead, Rask. Checking now.
HERRICK: It's moving on. Do you think it was looking for us?
JACKSON: It was looking for somebody. This planet is inhabited, all right.
JACKSON: There's a tunnel and a surveillance system, so whatever life there is is intelligent and we must be on our guard.
DOCTOR: Get on with it, Jackson.
JACKSON: All in good time, Doctor. Our objective is to locate the P7E and remove the race bank cylinders to a place of safety. The Quest is the Quest.
ALL: The Quest is the Quest.
JACKSON: Shield gun.
JACKSON: Silent routine.
HERRICK: Sir.
JACKSON: No, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The Quest is the Quest.
JACKSON: Our Quest, Doctor. Not yours.
DOCTOR: Of course.
DOCTOR: Welcome to the underworld.
LEELA: Are we going to follow them?
DOCTOR: Of course.
LEELA: Good. Oh, what about K9?
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll be all right. He's building up his strength.
LEELA: Well, how? There's no power source.
DOCTOR: Hmm, radiation.
LEELA: Radiation. That is lucky.
DOCTOR: Not at all. Igneous rock core, new planet, bound to be radiation. Luck? Physics isn't luck, physics is fact. Are facts. Is fact. Anyway, why do you think these tunnels were dug out?
LEELA: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Energy. Can't survive on a new planet with a soul full of hope and fresh air, you know.
LEELA: Shall we go?
DOCTOR: Shush. Shall we go?
DOCTOR: Did I ever tell you about the time I went to Aberdeen?
LEELA: Yes, the Granite City.
DOCTOR: That's right. Did you know, the people there absorb more radiation from the granite than people who work every day in nuclear power plants.
LEELA: Is that good for them?
DOCTOR: Well, of course it is. It shows that organisms can adapt to any kind of environment, even one like this with a high radiation count.
LEELA: Look out!
LEELA:  He looks like a wounded animal. Why's he so frightened?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'll ask him.
LEELA:  Look! Get back.
RASK: You two. That pile of rubble.
RASK: After them!
DOCTOR: Quick, in here.
LEELA : Keep still. Keep still! Oh, for a weapon.
RASK: Not here. Must have doubled back, damn Trogs. Know these warrens like the back of their hands. Security, not enough men. We're clearing out. I want tunnel nine, main and ancillary workings closed down once we're clear. Stand by for fumigation.
DOCTOR: Fumigation? I don't like the sound of that. They're going to smoke us out like badgers. Come on.
LEELA: Look, Doctor. Blood.
IDAS: No, no!
LEELA: Surrender or die!
DOCTOR: No, no! Don't, don't, don't. Get off him, Leela. You're terrifying the poor fellow.
LEELA: Oh.
DOCTOR: He's wounded. It's all right, we're friends. She won't hurt you.
IDAS: She?
DOCTOR: Leela.
IDAS: She is like the guards.
DOCTOR: Really?
LEELA: Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Fetch me a tissue, Leela, from the command deck.
LEELA: Tissue. Tissue from the command deck. Tissue from the command deck.
DOCTOR: What's your name?
IDAS: Idas.
DOCTOR: Idas? Hello, Idas.
IDAS: Hello.
DOCTOR: Are you frightened?
JACKSON: These tunnels could stretch for miles. P7E must be at the end of one of them, but which one?
ORFE: Split up, sir? Two pairs?
JACKSON: No. Herrick?
HERRICK: Sir.
JACKSON: Reconnoitre.
HERRICK: Yes, sir. I'll just put a marker here, sir.
JACKSON: We three stay here.
KLIMT: Klimt here. Possible suspect on nine.
HERRICK: Now where in Heed is?
KLIMT: Stop, Trog. Stop, Trog, or I'll fire.
HERRICK: Hey, who are you?
KLIMT: Stop, Trog!
HERRICK: Don't Trog me, you
BLACK : Officer Klimt? Officer Klimt? Clear tunnel nine. Clear tunnel nine.
TARN: Tunnel nine is being cleared for fumigation. Officer Klimt?
TARN: Officer Klimt! Officer Klimt!
BLACK : Klimt! Come in, please.
HERRICK: Oh, Officer Klimt has retired, suddenly.
BLACK : Who is that? Who is that?
HERRICK: Well, this is Trog Herrick, here. Who's that?
TARN: A Trog, and he's armed. Close down tunnel nine for fumigation!
RASK: Tunnel nine closing down.
HERRICK: Captain!
JACKSON: Herrick!
RASK: Tunnel nine closedown completed.
TARN: Fumigate!
RASK: Fumigating now.
DOCTOR: Well, that shouldn't take much fixing.
IDAS: Are you a Seer?
DOCTOR: What? Oh, Leela. Thank you.
DOCTOR: This is the one. Go back and unplug K9.
LEELA: Go back? But I've only just been
DOCTOR: Yes. Linked up like that, he's recharging the whole ship. I'll need him soon. The ship can look after itself.
LEELA: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Sting, did it? That's good. Now, what was it you wanted to know? Hmm?
IDAS: Are you a Seer?
DOCTOR: No, no, I'm just a traveller.
IDAS: Where? Where'd you come from?
DOCTOR: The sky.
IDAS: You lie!
DOCTOR: What?
IDAS: There's nothing but chaos above the sky.
DOCTOR: The stars, then?
IDAS: Stars?
DOCTOR: Yes, Idas. This ship comes from the stars.
IDAS: My father. My father talked of the stars. There's a prophecy amongst the slaves that one day gods will come and set us free. Are you a god?
DOCTOR: Well, no, but could you take me to your father? Why not?
IDAS: There was a skyfall. All our family were buried. My father said we should try and escape, but the guards have taken him and he's going to be sacrificed to the Oracle. There's nothing any one can do.
DOCTOR: We'll see about that. Come on, get up.
LEELA: I've unplugged K9.
DOCTOR: His name's Idas.
LEELA: Hello, Idas. Doctor! Doctor, look!
IDAS: A trap. A trap to kill me!
LEELA: Doctor? Doctor? Doctor, where are you?
DOCTOR: Get him to the command deck. He'll be all right there.
LEELA: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Out.
LEELA: Out there? You'll suffocate!
DOCTOR [OC}: Get him to the command deck!
LEELA: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Whatever blows can be sucked.
Part Three
JACKSON: Right. Blast it.
TARN: Yes, I will immediately. Thank you, Master.  Round up the slaves to watch the sacrifice.
TARN: Gas! Shut down the gas! Fumigation! Shut down the fumigation!
DOCTOR: I wonder where it all went?
JACKSON: Did you find it? Did you find the way to the P7E?
HERRICK: No, sir, but this man tried to kill me. Look at this.
TALA: Who was he?
HERRICK: I don't know, but the communicator kept calling him Officer Klimt.
JACKSON: Looted from the P7E.
IDAS: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Shush.
LEELA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hmm?
LEELA: I found another weapon.
DOCTOR: What? Good.
LEELA: Well, we've got to protect ourselves somehow.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
IDAS: Are you, are you really from the stars?
LEELA: Yes.
IDAS: The stars really exist, then?
LEELA: Of course they do.
IDAS: And that is not the sky?
LEELA: That is the roof.
IDAS: Roof?
LEELA: Yes.
IDAS: Will you take me with you when you return to the stars?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: No.
DOCTOR: But we've got problems with the ship.
IDAS: Ship?
LEELA: Yes. With this, here.
IDAS: Yes, your citadel. Yes, we have a citadel, too.
DOCTOR: You do?
IDAS: Yes.
DOCTOR: Where is it?
IDAS: It's where the Seers live, in metal rooms like this. It's where they hold the sacrifices. It's where my father is.
DOCTOR: Could you take us there?
IDAS: No.
DOCTOR: Why not?
IDAS: There's no time.
DOCTOR: No time? Don't say that to me, I'm a Time Lord. Come on!
LEELA: Do not worry. He has saved many fathers. Come on!
ANKH: Slaves must see the sacrifice, to show them who rules. See to it, Tarn, or you will be next.
TARN: Yes, Master.
RASK: Make the most of these few moments, slave. Enjoy them to the full. They are your last.
DOCTOR: I see. The Oracle tells the Seers.
IDAS: And the Seers tell the guards, and the guards tell us.
DOCTOR: Ah.
LEELA: And you do the work?
IDAS: Yes.
LEELA: Revolution! Wait, Idas. Has no one ever thought of revolution? Has no one ever rebelled?
IDAS: My father did.
LEELA: And?
DOCTOR: Shush, shush.
K9: Ready.
DOCTOR: Yes, good. Idas, K9 has made us a map of the tunnel. K9, find Jackson, bring him back here then follow us. Off you go.
K9: Retrieve and follow. Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Recognise that?
IDAS: The Tree. We call it the Tree.
DOCTOR: The Tree at the End of the World. Where are we?
IDAS: Here.
DOCTOR: Where's your father? I see. Can we get from there to there quickly?
IDAS: No.
DOCTOR: Why not?
IDAS: It's forbidden.
DOCTOR: Why?
IDAS: It's guarded by invisible dragons. Not even the guards can use it, only Seers. They have special powers.
DOCTOR: So do I, Idas. So do I. The Tree at the End of the World's always guarded by dragons. They're fire dragons, aren't they, with tongues of flame.
LEELA: Do not worry. Come on.
IDAS: No, Doctor. That's where the dragons live.
DOCTOR: Really? We'll see if they're at home, shall we? Here, try that.
DOCTOR: No, throw it, don't eat it.
LEELA: Oh.
DOCTOR: See the source?
DOCTOR: Got it with that one?
LEELA: Got it.
DOCTOR: Give it a blast.
DOCTOR: Now the door.
DOCTOR: Phew.
DOCTOR: In you go.
LEELA: Oh, no. There's nothing there.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is.
LEELA: No, there isn't.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is. Gravity.
LEELA: Gravity makes things fall.
DOCTOR: Towards the centre. This is the centre. Centre of the planet. Zero gravity, as in space. Watch.
LEELA: Come on. How do we move?
DOCTOR: Just push.
LEELA: Just
DOCTOR Push.
DOCTOR: Ready?
LEELA: Yes.
DOCTOR: And push.
They all push upwards with their arms.)
DOCTOR: And push.
DOCTOR: You all right, Idas?
TARN: Gate patrol! Alert! Alert!
ORACLE: Is the time right?
ANKH: The time is right.
ORACLE: Is the slave ready?
ANKH: He is ready.
ORACLE: And those who watch?
ANKH: They are full of fear.
ORACLE: Then shall not the sword ask its question?
ANKH: It shall be done.
ANKH: Let the Lamp of Life be lit.
ANKH: Lamp, burn.
ALL: Lamp, burn.
ANKH: Sword, fall.
ALL: Sword, fall.
ANKH: Ask the question that hangs over all.
ALL: Ask the question that hangs over all.
IDAS: And then the sword falls.
LEELA: Why go to so much trouble?
DOCTOR: Intimidation. The more ritual and mumbo-jumbo, the greater deterrent. That's the whole point of official sadism.
K9: Faster. Imperative move faster.
RASK: Don't move! Throw down the weapon.
DOCTOR: Throw it down.
RASK: Move!
RASK: Inside! Just in time to follow your father. Move!
ANKH: Ask.
RASK: The intruders, Master. Captured.
ANKH: Bring them forward.
RASK: In.
ANKH: They too will answer the question of the sword. Continue.
IDAS: No!
ANKH: Kill him! Kill him!
LEELA: Go! Come on.
IDAS: Yes.
DOCTOR: Into the tunnels! You'll never beat them here!
LAKH: Kill her!
ANKH: Kill them!
DOCTOR: Into the tunnels.
RASK: Gate control! Breakout! Slaves! Stop them!
HERRICK: This is more like it! Come on!
JACKSON: Herrick, come back!
LEELA: They've got us on both sides.
IDAS: We could try a rush. Well, we must do something.
IDMON: We must, son. We must.
JACKSON: Cover him!
HERRICK: Hey!
JACKSON: Come on, Tala. Herrick?
HERRICK: No, Captain. No, you go on. I've waited a long, long time for this. I'm not going to miss it now. Go back, Captain! Goodbye and good luck.
JACKSON: Goodbye, Herrick.
RASK: Good. Not dead yet. Take him inside for questioning.
NAIA: We are born, live and die in the tunnels, until now.
LEELA: There is nothing else?
NAIA: Nothing but the quota. This rock for the crushers.
LEELA: Rock?
NAIA: For fuel. For reprocessing into food so that we can go on working to get more rock. And then there are the skyfalls.
IDMON: Yes. They say they're accidents, but they're not. They can't be. It's the way they keep our numbers down so there's just enough of us to do the work, and no more.
IDAS:  If only we had more of these.
JACKSON:  We can't use the shaft again. They'd wipe us out before we got to the bridge. Is there another way?
IDAS: To the Tree? No.
LEELA: Doctor, Naia says they eat rock. Processed rock.
DOCTOR: Did I ever tell you about the time I went to Blackpool, hmm? If they process rock, they must take it in somewhere. Into the ship, the P7E, mustn't they?
LEELA: Crushers. Naia said something about crushers.
DOCTOR: Crushers. Yes. Yes, there must be another way. Tell me, why do you think Idas calls the tunnel system the Tree?
LEELA: Why shouldn't he? Idas has never seen a tree, has he. Why would he call it a tree?
DOCTOR: The Tree of Life. The race bank. The gift of immortality on the Tree of Life guarded by the dragon.
LEELA: The Oracle?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: Oh, that's just a myth, a story.
DOCTOR: Ah, myths often have a grain of truth in them, if you know where to look. Everybody here, except us, comes from the same stock as Jackson and company.
LEELA: The same stock?
DOCTOR: Yes. How else do you think they got here on the middle of a new planet?
LEELA: I don't know.
DOCTOR: They're the descendents of the people who came on the P7E. Jackson's probably Idas' great-great-great-great-great-great- grandfather a few times back.
LEELA: Great, great, great
DOCTOR: Yes. Don't worry about it.
LEELA: Great, great
DOCTOR: There is another way into the Citadel, you know.
JACKSON: The bridge'll be guarded.
DOCTOR: But not the goods entrance. They still need fuel, don't they? And they need food and they need rock, and the rock has to be crushed somewhere. Isn't that wonderful? Bring that sword.
DOCTOR: What do you think, Jackson?
JACKSON: It must be done in silence, without giving them a chance to use their weapons. One shot and the alarms'll go and they'll know we're in. It's difficult.
LEELA: But possible, if we can get behind them.
JACKSON: Possible if we can get the maximum of surprise, and if the Doctor's plan works.
DOCTOR: Well, it's not my plan exactly, but it has worked before. A fellow called Ulysses pulled it off a little while ago.
JACKSON: Who?
LEELA: Ulysses. Come on.
LAKH: Where are you from?
HERRICK: Minyos.
ANKH: Liar.
ANKH: Minyos was destroyed a hundred thousand years ago.
LAKH: Where are you from?
HERRICK: Minyos.
ANKH: Liar!
TARN: He tells the truth, Master.
LAKH: Silence! We are the only survivors of Minyos.
HERRICK: You? Never.
ANKH: What do you seek here? Why have you come?
HERRICK: I seek the future.
TARN: There is more, Master. He is holding back.
LAKH: What else? We can make your brain boil inside your skull. What else?
HERRICK: There's no reason why you should not know. We are Minyans. We're in search of the cylinders containing the race bank.
ANKH: Race bank?
LAKH: What cylinders?
HERRICK: The cylinders containing the genetic inheritance of the Minyan people. It was placed on board your ship, the P7E.
ANKH: You are mistaken.
LAKH: He is lying. More.
TARN: There is no more, Master. He speaks the truth.
HERRICK: The Quest. The Quest.
ANKH: This is not a ship. Not your P7E. And there is no such thing as this race bank you describe.
HERRICK: If you were Minyans,
LAKH: The guards and slaves are the only people of true Minyan descent. We have evolved far beyond them.
HERRICK: Then who are you?
ANKH: The servants of the Oracle. Seers of the realm of Hedas.
Meanwhile, up in the mine, a slave pushes an ore cart up to where two guards stand by the monorail. It tips out its cargo. Behind him, Idmon and Idas are pushing carts too, one containing the Doctor and Leela. Idmon falls at the end of the track.)
IDMON: The crusher!
Part Four
JACKSON: Cover him!
TALA: Captain.
JACKSON: Go on, Tala. Forward, Tala.
JACKSON: Withdraw!
JACKSON: Come on, pull! There we are.
DOCTOR: Quickly now. Stay calm. Everybody stay quite calm. Calm. K9, back to the ship. Check all the systems. We're leaving in a hurry.
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: There must be another way back to the Oracle. Jackson? Jackson, can you and the crew hold them off?
JACKSON: We'll certainly mount an attack, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. Leela?
LEELA: Hmm?
DOCTOR: You come with me.
LEELA: I'm staying to fight.
DOCTOR: You'll come with me. Idas, you too. Have you got a sword?
IDMON: Take care, son. Take care.
DOCTOR: Jackson. Right, Jackson.
JACKSON: Ready. Now!
JACKSON: Forward.
RASK: Security. They're driving us back.
DOCTOR: This way.
LEELA: No.
DOCTOR: What?
LEELA: Something's there.
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: Where does that lead?
IDAS: I don't know.
RASK : They are too strong for us! I need reinforcements.
TARN: Hold them. You must hold them.
LAKH: I order you to stand and fight. We must protect the Oracle.
RASK : But Master, we cannot hold for very much
LAKH: No excuses! Stand and fight.
HERRICK: There's no stopping us now. A hundred thousand years of searching, General. There's no stopping us now. I smell victory.
ANKH: Wait. Let us consider which is more important, the Oracle or these cylinders.
LAKH: The Oracle.
ANKH: Then should we not give them what they want and let them depart?
LAKH: But what they want does not exist.
ANKH: The Oracle will know. Why should we destroy each other?
LAKH: Very well.
ANKH: These cylinders you speak of, tell us what they look like. If they are indeed here, you shall have them and take them to your comrades.
HERRICK: You would set me free?
ANKH: Yes.
HERRICK: Well, there are two of them. Solid gold, stamped with the mark of Minyos, the length of a man's hand.
ANKH: Good.
LAKH: Tell Rask to arrange a truce.
LEELA: Doctor, we're here. Look.
ANKH: The intruders are defeating us. They will destroy us, destroy you, unless they are given these cylinders.
ORACLE: Then shall not they be destroyed by that which they so desperately desire?
ANKH: Can it be done?
ORACLE: Cannot all things be done?
LEELA: They have given up without a fight.
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly seems like it.
LEELA: Why?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Let's take a look.
JACKSON: No return of fire. What's going on?
ORFE: There are two of them.
JACKSON: No, wait. Could be a trick. Be ready.
RASK: I have been ordered to speak with you.
JACKSON: Surrender?
RASK: Truce.
JACKSON: On what terms?
RASK: The terms are that you take what you came for and depart, leaving us to our way. If not, your comrade will be executed.
JACKSON: What comrade? Herrick is dead.
RASK: You think so, Captain?
HERRICK: I got them. The Quest is over. The Quest is over.
HERRICK: The Quest is over.
JACKSON: At last.
DOCTOR: Stay here.
ORACLE: What is it that you want?
DOCTOR: The cylinders. The race bank of the Minyans.
ORACLE: Have they not been given?
DOCTOR: Well, that's what I'm asking.
ORACLE: Who are you to dare question my word?
DOCTOR: Well, who do I have to be to dare question your word? I'll give you a clue, shall I? If it wasn't for my people, you wouldn't have seen the light of day.
ORACLE: People? What people?
DOCTOR: The ones the Minyans call the gods.
ORACLE: Gods? There are no gods but me. Have I not created myself? Do I not rule? Am I not all-powerful?
DOCTOR: Well, yes, here you are, yes, but nowhere else. You're just another machine with megalomania. Another insane object, another self-aggrandising artefact. You're nothing. Nothing but a mass of superheated junk with delusions of grandeur.
ORACLE: Nothing? Am I not the keeper of the race bank?
DOCTOR: What did you say?
ORACLE: I am the keeper.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Then you've still got them.
ORACLE: I am the keeper.
DOCTOR: Keeper? You're nothing but a box, and I've got the key.  Give me that.
ORACLE: Destroy! Destroy!
ORACLE: No! Destroy!
LEELA: Doctor, they're coming. Come on!
ORACLE: Destroy!
LEELA: Doctor, leave it! Come on!
ORACLE: Destroy!
LEELA: Doctor, hurry! Come on now!
ORACLE: Destroy him!
LEELA: Hurry, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Almost there.
LEELA: Hurry, they're coming.
ORACLE: Destroy him!
LEELA: Doctor!
ORACLE: Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy him!
DOCTOR: No hard feelings.
LEELA: Come on!
ORACLE: Destroy him!
ANKH: After them. They must not meet the others.
LEELA: Which way? Which way?
DOCTOR: They know this place better than we do.
IDAS: The tunnels! Through there. They'll never find us through there.
TARN: They've reached tunnel seven, Master.
ANKH: Good. Close it down and collapse it.
IDAS: Quickly, through here. This was formed by the last skyfall. We should be safe in here.
LEELA: Safe?
LEELA: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: I'm just wondering what they've given Jackson.
JACKSON: The Quest is over. Set course for Minyos Two. K9, how do we stand for launch?
K9: Fuel absorption incomplete.
TALA: We've enough to get away, but it'll be a slow journey.
HERRICK: I say we go.
ORFE: We've got what we came for.
JACKSON: Right, prepare to launch.
K9: Negative.
JACKSON: What?
K9: Personnel incomplete. Doctor and the mistress not on board.
JACKSON: Find them. Tell them we're going. Now!
K9: Affirmative.
IDAS: We're trapped. Don't you understand, Doctor? We're trapped.
LEELA: Yes, we're going to be here for ever.
DOCTOR: No. They'll come and dig us out.
LEELA: Who?
DOCTOR: Well, whoever it was buried us.
LEELA: Why should they bother?
DOCTOR: Because we've got something it wants. The Oracle, remember?
ANKH: The cylinders must be replaced. Order a party of slaves to tunnel seven.
TARN: And the bodies of the intruders, Master?
ANKH: Into the crusher.
TALA: Five, four, three, two, one.
ORFE: Secondary check complete.
JACKSON: Third and final check. Commence countdown. Come on, Doctor, come on.
ORFE: Forty to launch.
DOCTOR: What kept you, K9?
K9: Gratitude is unnecessary. Speed is vital.
ORFE: Ten, nine
JACKSON: Run up on drive.
ORFE: Eight.
TALA: Drive running.
ORFE: Seven, six.
JACKSON: Pressurise.
ORFE: Five, four, three, two
JACKSON: Prepare to blast out.
ORFE: One.
DOCTOR : Stop!
DOCTOR: Here are your race banks.
JACKSON:  Then what are those?
DOCTOR: That's what I intend to find out.
DOCTOR: K9, what do you make of these?
K9: Analysis indicates fission grenades.
DOCTOR: What?
K9: Do not proceed. Impossible to defuse. Explosive contents in excess of two thousand megatons.
DOCTOR: Two thousand megatons?
JACKSON: How much time have we got?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
JACKSON: What are we going to do?
DOCTOR: I think I'd better get rid of them, don't you?
K9: Affirmative.
LEELA: Doctor, wait!
LEELA: Which way did he go?
IDAS: I don't know.
LEELA: He may have need of us. We'll try this way.
ORACLE: Why? Why have they not been found?
ANKH: The slaves are digging.
ORACLE: Shall they not be found? Are they not my purpose?
LAKH: They shall be found. It shall be done.
IDAS: It's no good. We've lost him.
LEELA: Come on.
DOCTOR: Excuse me, I'm a stranger here myself. Could you direct me to the Oracle?
RASK: Guards! I'll take those, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What, those? I wouldn't if I were you. They won't do you any
RASK: Give them here. You, take care of him. And make sure you finish him off this time. Then bring this lot back to the Citadel.
DOCTOR: You're making a terrible mistake. Those are the wrong ones.
RASK: You can do better than that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah, well, er.
DOCTOR: Look, getting rid of me isn't going to solve anything. Those cylinders were bombs. Why don't we just wait a few minutes and then we can all go together, hmm?
LEELA: Doctor! Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I think so. Come on, let's get out of here. We've got no time. Tell them they've got no time.
IDAS: Listen to me! The prophecy's being fulfilled. Our god has come to save us. We can escape to the stars. Hurry!
LEELA: We must hurry!
IDAS: Yes, come on, come on.
LEELA: Come on!
TARN: You have found them. Well done, Rask. Quickly.
ANKH: They have been found.
ORACLE: Replace them, quickly.
ORACLE: They must never leave my keeping again.
DOCTOR: Quiet! Quiet, everyone. Come on, here.
DOCTOR: Now listen to me. I want you to stay calm, and when I say, go quickly but quietly. Ready? Take this little one. Off you go now. Come on. Come on.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. Plenty of room for everyone. Everything's going to be all right. All right, all right.
JACKSON: What's going on? Get off, all of you. Off the ship! Get out!
DOCTOR: What are you doing? Never mind that!
JACKSON: What are you doing? We can't take all these people!
DOCTOR: No! Come on.
JACKSON: We can't. We're too low on fuel.
DOCTOR: This planet's going to explode.
JACKSON: Then get them off. Get off!
DOCTOR: Why?
JACKSON: I must safeguard the race bank.
DOCTOR: Why?
JACKSON: Why? The future of our people.
DOCTOR: Listen, Jackson. This is your people. This is your race. Descendents of the people who came on the P7E.
JACKSON: But we can't take the extra weight.
DOCTOR: Look this planet is going to explode, Jackson. Your only hope is to go, and go now. Go, Jackson, go!
DOCTOR: Right. Sit down, everybody. Sit down. Now, stay very calm.
HERRICK: Outer section sealed.
JACKSON: Run up on drive.
TALA: Drive running.
JACKSON: Pressurise.
ORFE: Check.
JACKSON: Prepare to blast out.
DOCTOR: Get down. Right down, right down.
TARN: They've cleared the surface. Not long now and they'll all be blown to bits.
ORACLE: These are not the cylinders! Get rid of them or we shall all be destroyed.
ANKH: Where?
ORACLE: Get rid of them! Get rid of them!
ANKH: But where? There's no time.
ORACLE: Get rid of them! Get rid of them!
ANKH: We can't.
ORACLE: Then defuse them!
ANKH: How?
JACKSON: More power!
TALA: I'm trying.
ORFE: We're falling back.
JACKSON: More power!
TALA: There is no more.
ORFE: The planet's gravity's pulling us back, sir.
DOCTOR: Everything all right, Jackson?
TALA: We don't have enough power to reach escape velocity.
JACKSON: You know why, don't you, Doctor? It's the extra weight, isn't it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, Jackson, be brave. Sit down.
ANKH: It is not possible.
ORACLE: Why? Why?
LAKH: You made it so.
ORACLE: Then I have failed in my duty, and deserve destruction.
DOCTOR: There she goes. If you wanted power, Jackson, get ready to ride out the blast.
ORFE: We made it!
JACKSON: Speed?
TALA: Four sevenths light.
JACKSON: Course?
ORFE: One two zero, sir.
JACKSON: How long to Minyos Two?
HERRICK: Three hundred and seventy years, sir. That's nothing, is it?
JACKSON: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Yes?
JACKSON: Aren't you coming with us to Minyos Two?
DOCTOR: No, no, no time. I'm very busy. Goodbye, Jason.
ORFE: Goodbye.
HERRICK: Goodbye!
LEELA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
LEELA: Why did you call him Jason?
DOCTOR: Who?
LEELA: Jackson.
DOCTOR: What? I called Jackson Jason?
LEELA: Yes. Is Jackson Jason?
DOCTOR: No, Jackson isn't Jason.
LEELA: Well, is Jason Jackson?
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Jason was another captain on a long quest.
LEELA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Ah. He was looking for the Golden Fleece.
LEELA: Did he find it?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. He found it hanging on a tree at the end of the world. Perhaps those myths are not just old stories of the past, you see, but prophecies of the future. Who know? What do you think, K9?
K9: Negative.
DOCTOR: What did he say?
LEELA: Negative.
DOCTOR: Negative? Can he paint? Hmm? Negative.
LEELA: Negative.
