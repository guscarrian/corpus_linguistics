The Android Invasion
Part One
SARAH : Well, come on, make your mind up. Has the Tardis brought us home or not?
DOCTOR: Possibly.
SARAH: What do you mean, possibly.
DOCTOR: Well, the coordinates were set for your time, but the linear calculator, well. Ginger pop?
SARAH: Can't stand the stuff, thanks all the same. So we could be anytime, anywhere?
DOCTOR: I really must get the Tardis seen to. She's way overdue her five hundred year service.
SARAH: Well, at least we're on Earth. I mean, just taste that air. I love that fresh smell just after a rain shower.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does have that peculiar earthy smell. Which is odd when you look at the ground.
SARAH: Hmm?
DOCTOR: It's bone dry. Can't have been any rain here for more than a week.
DOCTOR: Now I wonder what could be causing that.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Some enormous release of energy.
SARAH: We are on Earth, aren't we?
DOCTOR: Well, unless someone's started exporting acorns. Oak trees don't grow anywhere else in the Galaxy.
SARAH: Bet we're miles away from UNIT HQ though. So, what are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Eenie, meenie, minie, mo?
DOCTOR: Watch the bramble.
SARAH: Ow.
DOCTOR: I told you to watch the bramble.
SARAH: Listen, what's so special about eenie meenie minie mo?
DOCTOR: Nothing. It could just as easily have be fum fo fee fi.
SARAH: Fee fi fo fum.
SARAH: Hang on. I thought I saw someone.
DOCTOR: Let's hope they're not strangers here themselves. Hello there!
SARAH: No. Wait, Doctor. I don't like the look of them.
DOCTOR: What? Please excuse me. Could you be very kind and tell me where we are?
DOCTOR: I thought it was odd. Didn't you think it was odd? I remember once at the battle of Malplaquet, I said to the Duke of Marlborough
SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor! Let's get out of here! Argh!
DOCTOR: Sarah! Don't look down!
SARAH: Thanks.
DOCTOR: My pleasure. Couldn't leave you hanging around in a place like this.
DOCTOR: Stop, man. Stop!
SARAH: No! No!
DOCTOR: He must have died instantly.
SARAH: Look. He's from UNIT.
DOCTOR: Look at these.
SARAH: They're all new. 
DOCTOR: Freshly minted. No scratches, tarnish.
SARAH: And all dated the same year.
DOCTOR: What are the odds against finding a pocket full of coins all dated the same?
SARAH: I don't understand it.
DOCTOR: No. Nor do I, yet.
SARAH: Oh, come on, Doctor. It's just a load of old junk.
DOCTOR: No, no, shush, wait, wait. I've seen something like this before. My memory's getting terrible. You know, three hundred years ago I'd have recognised this like a shot.
SARAH: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Keep down!
DOCTOR: Something seems to have annoyed them again. Come on.
DOCTOR: Well, well. Well, well.
SARAH: Devesham.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
SARAH: Doctor, we're at Devesham.
DOCTOR: Do you know it?
SARAH: I came here on a story about two years ago.
DOCTOR: It's a bit quiet.
SARAH: Yes.
DOCTOR: Anyone about? Anyone?
DOCTOR: No one about. Let's try the pub.
DOCTOR: Hello? Innkeeper?
SARAH: Hello? Anyone about?
DOCTOR: What's this pub called?
SARAH: Er, Fleur de Lys, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: What?
SARAH: Fleur de Lys.
DOCTOR: Marie Celeste, more like it.
SARAH: It's weird. A whole village full of people can't just disappear.
DOCTOR: Here it is again.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Freshly minted money, all the same year. Sarah?
SARAH: Hmm?
DOCTOR: What was that story you came here on?
SARAH: There was a bit of a brouhaha at the Space Defence Station. It's about a mile from here.
DOCTOR: Is it. If we've landed in a prohibited area, then those people who shot at us were possibly guards.
SARAH: Trespassers are prosecuted in England, not killed. Anyway, they weren't dressed like guards.
DOCTOR: Protective clothing? Some kind of radioactivity? Remember, I detected an energy source. The soldier who went over the cliff was possibly affected by it.
SARAH: Radiation sickness?
DOCTOR: Something like that.
SARAH: And this place, the village?
DOCTOR: Evacuated.
SARAH: Then it must've been done in a hurry.
DOCTOR: If some dangerous substance leaked, it would be an emergency.
SARAH: That's great. And we've been walking around in the middle of it like a couple of 'narnas.
DOCTOR: It's only a speculation.
SARAH: It's a nasty one. What about the money?
DOCTOR: Contamination precaution. Money changes hands. In a place like this, it might be necessary to bring in clean currency every few months.
SARAH: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Huh?
SARAH: The village isn't deserted anymore.
SARAH: No, it can't be. It can't be!
DOCTOR: That's impossible.
SARAH: He was dead. We saw him.
SARAH: They heard me.
DOCTOR: Wait.
SARAH:  The man in the tweed jacket, that's Mister Morgan, the landlord.
DOCTOR:  Come on.
DOCTOR: Extraordinary.
SARAH: What's the matter with them?
DOCTOR: I haven't the faintest idea, but I intend to find out.
SARAH: How?
DOCTOR: Space Defence Station. I could contact UNIT from there. You stay here and keep an eye on things.
SARAH: Eh?
DOCTOR: You'll be all right.
SARAH: I've heard that before.
DOCTOR: Can you find your way back to the Tardis?
SARAH: Of course I can.
DOCTOR: Right. If anything goes wrong, meet me there.
SARAH: And what if
SARAH: Afternoon. Well, just about, anyway. Hallo. Mister Morgan, isn't it? You remember me, don't you? Sarah Jane Smith? I came here on a story. I stayed here about two years ago.
SARAH: Well, somebody say something.
ADAMS: Who sent you?
SARAH: What do you mean, who sent me?
ADAMS: How did you get here?
SARAH: I walked. Look, perhaps you'd like
ADAMS: What are you doing here?
SARAH: Do you allow all your customers to be grilled like this?
ADAMS: We don't have strangers here.
SARAH: Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
MORGAN: Wait. She may be part of the test.
SARAH: Test? What test?
ADAMS: She doesn't know.
SARAH: What don't I know? Look, what's going on here?
MORGAN: I think you'd better go, Miss.
SARAH: Why?
MORGAN: It might be best.
SARAH: Look, if there's some sort of trouble, perhaps I could help. I see. Well, I intend to find out, anyway.
SARAH: And I'm sure you shouldn't be drinking so soon after breaking your neck.
DOCTOR: Can you tell me where I can find the CO? The Commanding Officer?
DOCTOR: I'll tell you what. I won't bother you.
SARAH: Doctor! Don't go! I'm still here!
SARAH: Don't leave me.
SARAH: Can't have gone.
SARAH: Can I help you?
STYGGRON : Crayford! Crayford! Crayford, I say.
CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron.
STYGGRON : I ordered all units to recharge stations. The order is not being observed.
CRAYFORD: In what way, Styggron?
STYGGRON : We have detected movement within the complex. A unit may have gone random. Check and report!
CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron. Immediately, Styggron.
DOCTOR: Alistair? Alistair?
CRAYFORD: Keep your hands where I can see them.
DOCTOR: Those are the first friendly words I've heard since I got here.
CRAYFORD: Yes, I dare say. And just how did you get here, incidentally?
DOCTOR: Oh, I dropped in. You know, I do from time to time.
CRAYFORD: I can easily get the truth from you.
DOCTOR: You're getting it.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
CRAYFORD: I'm asking the questions and I have the gun.
DOCTOR: I just wondered. You're in someone else's office. It says Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart on the door.
CRAYFORD: You know the Brigadier?
DOCTOR: Mmm. I'm his unpaid scientific advisor.
CRAYFORD: Oh yes. Yes, I see. I see, you're the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes.
CRAYFORD: Yes, I've heard of you.
DOCTOR: Good. Who are you?
CRAYFORD: I'm the Senior Defence astronaut, Guy Crayford.
DOCTOR: Well, how do you do.
CRAYFORD: Get your hands up, Doctor, thank you. You could be an impostor, couldn't you.
DOCTOR: Look, I've got a suggestion. My arms are beginning to ache. Why not call Lethbridge Stewart and get him to identify me?
CRAYFORD: Lethbridge Stewart is in Geneva. Colonel Faraday is in command.
DOCTOR: If you're calling the butler, I'm very partial to tea and muffins.
CRAYFORD: You're going to have to stay in detention until your identity's been verified.
DOCTOR: Oh, please, no detention. Not detention. You see, I suffer from
CRAYFORD: Get after him, man!
DOCTOR: Is that finger loaded?
SARAH:  Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me?
DOCTOR : Sarah, what are you doing here?
SARAH: Rescuing you, actually. For a change.
DOCTOR : Thank you.
Part Two
DOCTOR : Get a move on.
SARAH: It's stuck!
SARAH: Doctor, what did you do?
DOCTOR: Ask me later. Come on.
STYGGRON: Crayford?
CRAYFORD : Yes, Styggron?
STYGGRON: Crayford, a second random unit in the cell area. What has gone wrong?
CRAYFORD : A second?
STYGGRON: These patterns were not programmed. Explain.
CRAYFORD : Styggron, was this second unit a female?
STYGGRON: Yes, one of the village section. Check the directives. A fault must have developed.
CRAYFORD [on monitor: It's not a fault, Styggron, it's a remarkable success.
STYGGRON: A success?
CRAYFORD : They are space travellers. The Doctor, as he is called, is a humanoid, a scientist who advices on Earth Defence. His companion is human.
STYGGRON: I see. Then they are externals.
CRAYFORD : They've arrived by error.
STYGGRON: Perhaps by error, perhaps by design.
CRAYFORD : Design?
STYGGRON: If this Doctor advises on defence
CRAYFORD : The cell block.
STYGGRON: They must not escape, Crayford. They must not escape!
SARAH : Doctor, what on Earth did you do?
DOCTOR : Do?
SARAH : For them to lock you up? I mean, they seem to be taking you very seriously.
DOCTOR: I didn't do anything. Just finding me on the premises was enough to upset Crayford.
SARAH: Crayford?
DOCTOR: Yes, Guy Crayford. He said he was the senior astronaut.
SARAH: But that's impossible. Guy Crayford was killed.
DOCTOR: How?
SARAH: That was the first test of the XK-5 space freighter. Crayford was out in space, deep space, and then they lost him. The ship just vanished. They thought he'd hit an asteroid.
SARAH: Guy Crayford is dead, Doctor.
CRAYFORD: There's no cause for alarm, Styggron. The station is being thoroughly searched section by section. All exits are covered and the guards have orders to shoot on sight.
STYGGRON : Then countermand that order. They must be kept alive for pattern analysis.
CRAYFORD: But Styggron, we already have a complete pattern for the village and Defence complex.
STYGGRON : Do as I say. The Doctor may have learned of the Kraal plan. He may be here to spy. It is essential for us to know.
CRAYFORD: No, Styggron, no. They must be eliminated! They must be destroyed!
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. It's a small world.
SARAH: Isn't it. Hello, Mister Benton!
DOCTOR: Benton?
SARAH: Benton, it's us!
STYGGRON : You shall do as I say!
CRAYFORD: Ow! Ow! No! Stop! All right!
CRAYFORD: All units. The order to kill is cancelled.
DOCTOR: Come on.
BENTON: This is B block, main entrance. They've just escaped, sir.
BENTON: Ah, Corporal Alert the security patrol immediately. The rest of you, get after them! Spread out.
SARAH : Why did we come back? We should've hoofed it when we had the chance. We're bound to be caught now.
DOCTOR : On the contrary.
DOCTOR: The further they spread out, the better our chance of escape.
CRAYFORD : Sullivan!
CRAYFORD: Take a mobile troop and put a cordon on the perimeter road.
HARRY: Yes, sir.
SARAH:  Harry's not a soldier.
DOCTOR: That improves our chances.
SARAH: All our friends
DOCTOR: Lead by a dead man. Fascinating.
SARAH: Look, what's going on?
DOCTOR: How do you know Crayford's dead?
SARAH: It was that story I came here on two years ago. Why?
DOCTOR: I don't think Crayford died in space. When he finally got back here, something returned with him.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Something that's controlling every human being for miles around.
SARAH: Including Harry and Mister Benton.
DOCTOR: Yes. Come on.
SARAH: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Back to the village. We've got to warn London.
DOCTOR: So far so good.
SARAH: As the man said when he fell from the skyscraper.
SARAH: Dogs!
DOCTOR: Tracker dogs?
SARAH: Ah!
DOCTOR: Are you all right?
SARAH: Yes!
DOCTOR: Well, come on then.
DOCTOR: Come on.
SARAH: Can't. Hurt my ankle.
DOCTOR: I'll carry you.
SARAH: No, you won't. I'll only slow you down.
DOCTOR: Give me your scarf.
SARAH: Hmm?
DOCTOR: Quickly, quickly, come on! I'll try to draw them off. You can hide in the tree.
SARAH: But how
DOCTOR: Come on, up.
DOCTOR: See you back at the pub. If I'm not there in an hour, try the Tardis.
SARAH: Doctor, I forgot to tell you
SARAH: The Tardis is gone.
ADAMS: They must have swum across.
ADAMS: Right, you two go that way. We'll try to head them off.
STYGGRON: Report! Report!
CRAYFORD : The girl is captured. We shall soon have the Doctor.
STYGGRON: No! Locate him, but do not seize him. I have other plans for the Doctor.
HARRY: It's no good, Miss Smith.
SARAH: Harry?
HARRY: She's ready.
STYGGRON : Commence the analysis of the brain.
MORGAN: Something you want, sir?
DOCTOR: Yes. A telephone that works. Yours is out of order.
MORGAN: Likely it is.
DOCTOR: So is the village call box.
MORGAN: There was a gale last night, sir. Brought all the lines down.
DOCTOR: Ah. I always told Alexander Bell that wires were unreliable.
MORGAN: Can I get you a drink, sir?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'll have a pint.
MORGAN: A pint of what?
DOCTOR: Ginger beer.
MORGAN: You must be one of them scientists from the Defence Station.
DOCTOR: Well, yes and no, or no and yes, so to speak. As it were. Do you get much custom from there?
MORGAN: Don't come down here much.
DOCTOR: Really?
MORGAN: Nothing for them in Devesham. Nothing for strangers here.
DOCTOR: Yes. Too quiet, I suppose.
MORGAN: Except for darts club night, of course.
DOCTOR: Ha. Of course.
 DOCTOR: Hey, this is a brand new darts board. Never been used before.
STYGGRON: See? He is puzzled. Suspicious, but not certain.
CHEDAKI: There is no value in this experiment, Styggron. Our strategy is settled.
STYGGRON: Strategy is formulated upon knowledge, Chedaki.
CHEDAKI: The time for experiment is past.
STYGGRON: In the case of the Earth, yes, but there are other worlds that our people can conquer. It is important to see that our techniques are flawless, and the Doctor is unprogrammed. A free agent.
STYGGRON: Crayford!
CRAYFORD: Yes, Styggron?
STYGGRON : Commence the final test.
CRAYFORD: Direct communication.
STYGGRON: Yes. Are the preparations complete?
CRAYFORD: There should have been sufficient time. I will check, Styggron.
CHEDAKI: The data that was drained from the girl shows the Doctor's long association with libertarian causes. His entire history is one of opposition to conquest. While he lives, he is a threat.
STYGGRON: His history will end soon, Chedaki, when I have nothing further to learn from studying him.
CRAYFORD: Where's the girl?
HARRY: The analysis is completed. We have her memory print and body parameters. They're being coded.
CRAYFORD: Right. Well, see she's properly guarded. Styggron wants to run a test on the Doctor. Is the programming complete?
HARRY: Yes, sir. We can begin at once.
CRAYFORD: Right. Good, good.
DOCTOR: Yuk. Plastic horse brass?
DOCTOR: I've arranged to wait for someone here. Don't let me detain you.
MORGAN: That's all right.
DOCTOR: Well, I can see you're a busy man. Barrels to tap, empties to count, that sort of thing.
MORGAN: No hurry for that.
DOCTOR: Right, then I'll have another pint.
MORGAN: A pint of what?
DOCTOR: Well, ginger pop, please.
DOCTOR: Strange. A village without a future? 
MORGAN: Fleur de Lys? It's for you.
DOCTOR: Is it? Hello? Sarah? What's happened, where are you?
SARAH: They caught me, but I managed to escape. Listen, Doctor, I've found out their whole plan. No. No, the inn is one of their centres. That's why I didn't come there.
DOCTOR: where are you, Sarah?
SARAH: The village store. You can cut through to it behind the pub. Yes, I'll wait for you. But Doctor, be careful. Those robot mechanics are planted everywhere.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Sarah. Who'd notice me?
DOCTOR: Well, would you believe it? It's out of order again. Thanks for the hospitality. 
CHEDAKI: If the androids were to fail in their task, the Kraal invasion of Earth could not even begin. Suppose the Doctor were to turn the androids against us? It would jeopardise the whole operation!
STYGGRON: Impossible!
CHEDAKI: Is it? He is a scientist too, Styggron.
STYGGRON: Well, the androids are centrally governed. Their programming is controlled from here.
CHEDAKI: They could be reprogrammed> He has the knowledge.
STYGGRON: An interesting possibility.
CHEDAKI: The androids are a double-edged weapon, Styggron. They are unstoppable, indestructible.
CRAYFORD: Everything is ready, Styggron.
STYGGRON: Not quite. I need one more android, Crayford. I must call on your experience for its production.
CRAYFORD: But you already have my data. The memory prints in the disorientation centre.
STYGGRON: This is new. You must be reprocessed.
CRAYFORD: Styggron, I can't go through that again.
STYGGRON: I need one special unit. An android programmed to attack Kraals.
CRAYFORD: But I don't
STYGGRON: Do not argue, Crayford! Come!
SARAH: Is that you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course it is. How did you get away?
SARAH: Oh, thank goodness. I've been terrified!
DOCTOR: I left you up a tree.
SARAH: I climbed out of the tree and those soldiers were waiting for me. I was knocked out. When I came round, I was in some kind of operating theatre. Doctor, I was so frightened.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you were. Have some ginger pop. Here.
SARAH: It was delicious. Harry was there. Well, not the real Harry, of course, but I thought it was.
DOCTOR: What do you mean, not the real Harry?
SARAH: Well, Doctor, that's what they're doing. They're copying people.
DOCTOR: Who are?
SARAH: I don't know, but Crayford's behind it all.
DOCTOR: Shush.
DOCTOR: It can't be Crayford, but go on.
SARAH: There's not much more to tell. They put me in some kind of machine, and I passed out again.
DOCTOR: How did you get away?
SARAH: When I came round the second time, I heard Crayford talking to someone. That's when I discovered what they're planning. They're replacing people with these duplicates they make. Well, they thought I was still unconscious and left me without a guard.
DOCTOR: And you were lucky enough to find this place? And the only telephone in the place that worked.
SARAH: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: I think they let you make that telephone call.
SARAH: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: I mean we're being tested. They want to find out how smart we are.
SARAH: No, it can't be that.
DOCTOR: Of course it's that. What I don't understand is, if they're so advanced in technology, they've made facsimile human beings good enough to stand face to face examination, and sent them through a space time warp to Earth, what can they be afraid of? They must possess the weaponry to take the Earth by force. They've created a bridgehead by stealth using androids. Fake humans. Come on.
SARAH: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Well, there's a radio in the Tardis. Are you coming?
SARAH: Coming.
DOCTOR: Let's go.
STYGGRON: This should answer your fears, Chedaki. From Crayford's memory cells we will now create a totally hostile android.
CRAYFORD: Don't, Styggron, I beg you.
CHEDAKI : What is the purpose of this, Styggron?
STYGGRON: Watch.
STYGGRON: I will now activate the hostility circuits.
STYGGRON: See? They are not indestructible, Chedaki. What I can create, I can also destroy!
CHEDAKI : That weapon. It is new.
STYGGRON: So far effective only at short range, but my armoury section is developing a much more powerful version for our space cruisers. Science, Chedaki! Science will make the Kraals invincible!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, this is the oak tree. This is where we landed.
SARAH: Well, it's not here now, is it.
DOCTOR: It's not programmed to auto-operate. There's a fail safe. Unless
SARAH: Unless what, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Of course, I know. You've still got a Tardis key, haven't you?
SARAH: I must've lost it.
DOCTOR: You haven't lost it. You never had it. Sarah came here, turned the key in the lock, and cancelled the pause control. The Tardis continued on its set coordinates back to Earth.
SARAH: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do. This isn't Earth. This isn't real wood. It's some kind of artificial material like plastic. These are not real trees. And you're not the real Sarah.
SARAH: Get back, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I knew at once. You see, the real Sarah wasn't wearing her scarf.
DOCTOR: What have you done with Sarah? Where is the real Sarah?
Part Three
CHEDAKI: A foolish experiment, Styggron. The Doctor is at large.
STYGGRON: There's no way of escape.
STYGGRON: He can do no harm.
CHEDAKI: He is a Time Lord.
STYGGRON: At the end of his time. The androids are now fully trained. Both the village and the Doctor will be destroyed in precisely nine minutes.
CHEDAKI: Nine minutes?
STYGGRON: The invasion countdown has begun. There will be no variation in the schedule.
CHEDAKI: I understand. Is there a safe method of destroying the training ground?
STYGGRON: A matter dissolving bomb, which I shall place in position.
CHEDAKI: Good. The Earth female. She is still alive?
STYGGRON: Yes, Marshal Chedaki. She has been preserved.
CHEDAKI: Why?
STYGGRON: Another of my foolish experiments. The virus which our androids will use to cleanse the Earth of its human population has only been proved in laboratory conditions. I wish to test it on a living human organism.
CHEDAKI: Ah. Good, good. That's a good idea, Styggron.
STYGGRON : Praise indeed, from a soldier.
SARAH: Nine minutes.
CRAYFORD: Come on now. Hurry along.
CRAYFORD: Quickly now.
CRAYFORD: Any more?
BENTON: We're the last, sir.
CRAYFORD: Right.
CRAYFORD: See all the blast doors are closed. You have four minutes.
HARRY: Yes, sir. 
DOCTOR: Oh, hello.
STYGGRON: Resistance is inadvisable.
DOCTOR: Look here, we haven't been introduced, have we?
STYGGRON: This is no time for niceties.
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. An MD bomb.
STYGGRON: In exactly three minutes, our simulated Earth village will evaporate, and you with it!
DOCTOR: You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
DOCTOR: Don't go. Stay. Just for a few minutes. Then we can all go together.
SARAH : Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm over here!
SARAH: Listen, this place is going to be blown sky high. Well, don't just sit there, come on!
DOCTOR: I'm not just sitting here, I'm tied up.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Knife in my right hand pocket.
SARAH: It won't cut. It's as strong as steel.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's their artificial ivy. Try the sonic screwdriver. Set it to theta omega.
BOMB: Thirty seconds. Twenty five seconds.
BOMB: Twenty seconds.
SARAH: Hang on! I know one of the ways out!
BOMB: Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
BOMB: One, zero!
DOCTOR: A bit close.
SARAH: Wouldn't have cared to have been any closer.
CRAYFORD: Escort them to the cell. I must report this to Styggron.
DOCTOR: Styggron? Who's Styggron?
CRAYFORD: Move!
DOCTOR: I prefer our Harry.
KRAAL : Leader rocket in launch phase. Time to lift off, ninety minutes.
STYGGRON: Have the pre-launch checks been completed?
KRAAL: Yes, the androids are being loaded now.
CRAYFORD: Styggron! We have recaptured the girl. She was with the Doctor.
STYGGRON: The Doctor?
CRAYFORD: It seems she helped him to escape.
STYGGRON: He must be destroyed at once. Have him killed.
CRAYFORD: Why, Styggron? There's really no need.
STYGGRON: Oh, you're singing a different song now, Crayford. They must be eliminated, isn't that what you said?
CRAYFORD: That was because they were a danger to the plan, Styggron. I mean, what harm can they do now, locked away in a cell?
STYGGRON: The Doctor is no longer of any use.
CRAYFORD: But he would make a valuable subject for analysis.
STYGGRON: Analysis?
CRAYFORD: Yes, the knowledge and experience of a Time Lord would make a, well, a useful addition to the Kraal data banks.
STYGGRON: You were happy for him to die, provided I killed him. You are squeamish, Crayford. A puny minded weakling, like all your race. Oh, very well, very well.
CRAYFORD: Thank you, Styggron.
STYGGRON: We shall analyse his brain, and then he shall die.
SARAH: Not on Earth? What do you mean? Of course we're on Earth.
DOCTOR: Harry and Benton and the rest are not the real thing.
SARAH: Not real?
DOCTOR: Fakes, copies. Electronic androids with well programmed computers instead of brains.
SARAH: It all makes sense now.
DOCTOR: If I'd had my wits around me, I'd have known it from the start. Remember that high level of radiation I'd noticed when we left the Tardis?
SARAH: Yes, you thought there'd been a leak from the Defence Station.
DOCTOR: That was natural radiation. The Kraal planet Oseidon is the only planet in the galaxy with a level that high.
DOCTOR: This is no good.
SARAH: Won't that radiation make us ill?
DOCTOR: Well, It's not that bad, yet.
SARAH: All the same, the sooner we get away from here, the better.
DOCTOR: Quite right. Any level of radiation is too high, and it's getting worse all the time. Won't be long before the place becomes uninhabitable. That's why the Kraals are planning to leave and take over Earth.
SARAH: So, everything we've seen has been a fake.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SARAH: But the village.
DOCTOR: Yes, and the woods, and the Defence Station. Every last detail copied down, including the inhabitants.
SARAH: Like a sort of training ground.
DOCTOR : Exactly. And they've hardly made a slip. One or two, perhaps, like mint-fresh money all the same date. Otherwise, they've got everything right.
CRAYFORD: I've, er, been listening to your conversation.
DOCTOR: Well, nobody's perfect.
CRAYFORD: I hear you're impressed by the thoroughness with which this operation has been planned.
DOCTOR: Well, it is impressive, but doomed to fail in the end.
CRAYFORD: Oh no, Doctor. No, shortly I shall leave for Earth. The Kraals will project me through the space time warp and my ship will make a normal re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
DOCTOR: A normal re-entry? Crayford, you've been gone two years, assumed dead.
CRAYFORD: Ah, yes, Doctor, but I have recently re-established radio contact with Earth. They know about the stabiliser failure that sent me into orbit around Jupiter. They know how I've rationed my provisions, particularly drinking water. My recycling experiments. Already, every telescope on Earth is trained on that little patch of sky where my XK-5 will reappear.
DOCTOR: A gigantic hoax.
CRAYFORD: Exactly, Doctor, yes! And all brilliantly planned by Styggron, the chief scientist of the
DOCTOR: But helped by you. He couldn't have done it without your knowledge and memory.
CRAYFORD: Yes, the Kraals have a superb technology, Doctor.
SARAH: Why did you do it? What made you betray Earth?
CRAYFORD: Well, didn't Earth betray me? I was written off, wasn't I? Left to die in space. It was the Kraals who saved me. I mean, I was dying, wasn't I? I was being torn apart by gyro failure. And they reconstructed me, Miss Smith, in every detail. Except the one eye that for some reason couldn't be found. Oh no, I owe them everything.
SARAH: And that's what they want. Everything. They want the world.
CRAYFORD: Look, the increasing radiation here means that they're a doomed race. They just have to leave, don't they. I mean, why should a people with such skills be allowed to die?
SARAH: The human race has a few skills of its own.
CRAYFORD: Yes, I know, I know. But the Kraals have promised me that no humans will be harmed, as long as they obey the ultimatum that's been prepared. You see, the Kraals are going to take over the northern hemisphere and live in peace! I have their word for it.
DOCTOR: You've been brainwashed, Crayford.
CRAYFORD: Before my spaceship lands, the space shells with the androids inside will be launched. Now, if anyone sees them, they'll just be taken for meteorites, you see? And then the androids will take over the key positions in the Defence Complex and the way will be clear for Marshall Chedaki to bring in the main invasion fleet without a shot being fired!
DOCTOR: I see, I see. Tell me, if your Kraal friends are so unviolent, why did Styggron try to vaporise me?
CRAYFORD: Oh, yes. Yes, well, they thought you were a danger.
DOCTOR: Oh.
CRAYFORD: You see, Miss Smith's memory prints had showed your past intense involvement in the defence of Earth. But I have persuaded them to utilise that knowledge. It won't be wasted. See, Styggron's machine extracts and feeds into a computer the memory and entire intelligence of any living being. It's painful, I know, but it's better than dying.
STYGGRON : Service mechanics move to leader rocket loading bay now.
CRAYFORD: I'm sorry, I have to go now. Now, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: We have to warn Earth.
SARAH: How? We don't even have the Tardis.
STYGGRON: Only one drop.
CHEDAKI: Launch countdown commences in sixty minutes, Styggron.
STYGGRON: Careful how you handle it.
CHEDAKI: You are testing the culture.
STYGGRON: Yes, Marshall. That small phial contains a death sentence for the entire human race. Be careful!
CHEDAKI: Is it safe?
STYGGRON: As long as only the androids have contact with the virus.
STYGGRON: No, no, no, no, no! Place it in the steriliser.
STYGGRON: Good. Now take the tray to the detention cell.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think this has possibilities.
SARAH: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Well, if we can somehow lure that guard in, give him a good stiff jolt.
SARAH: Electrocute him?
DOCTOR: Well, randomise him, to be accurate. Remember, he's only a machine.
SARAH: Someone's coming.
HARRY: Food and drink.
DOCTOR: How thoughtful. Bread and water.
SARAH: It's better than nothing, I suppose. I'm dying for a drink.
HARRY: You're to come with me.
DOCTOR: Careful! You androids don't know your own strength.
SARAH: Where are you taking him? Doctor! 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Sarah. And don't waste the water. Remember, it's an excellent conductor.
DOCTOR: So this is where you put Crayford together. Careless of you to lose his eye.
STYGGRON: Harry, I have little time.
DOCTOR: Going somewhere, are you?
STYGGRON: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, well.
STYGGRON: Secure his limbs!
STYGGRON: In a moment, Doctor, the knowledge and experience of your entire life will be transposed into our data bank.
DOCTOR: That's stealing.
STYGGRON: While you are making your small contribution to Kraal culture, I shall be on my way to destroy the humans that you have so often defended. This time, you will be powerless to help them.
DOCTOR: So you do intend genocide.
STYGGRON: Earth's resources are limited. They cannot be wasted supporting an inferior species.
DOCTOR: How do you intend to destroy the humans, Styggron? If you use nuclear weapons, you'll raise Earth's radiation level beyond your own point of tolerance.
STYGGRON: Nothing so crude as fission weapons. The androids will disseminate a virus. It will cause a contagion so lethal the Earth will be rid of its human population within three weeks. Then it will burn itself out, and the world will be ours.
DOCTOR: Where will you be all this time?
STYGGRON: Crayford's rocket will prove an effective quarantine chamber. I shall remain inside until the virus has done its work. Then I shall signal Marshall Chedaki to bring in our invasion fleet.
DOCTOR: The best laid schemes of mice and Kraals gang aft agley.
STYGGRON: What?
DOCTOR: Something will go wrong, Styggron.
STYGGRON: Nothing will go wrong!
STYGGRON: In eight minutes, Doctor, the Analyser will have completed its recording. Unfortunately, I shall not be here to turn it off. Your brain tissue will expand under the stimulation until eventually, your skull bursts. I imagine it will be a most disagreeable death.
DOCTOR: We shall see.
STYGGRON: Defiant to the end, Doctor. But you will soon be screaming for mercy and there will be no one here.
SARAH: Doctor. Doctor, come on! Come on, wake up, Doctor! Come on! Doctor, please, come on. Wake up.
DOCTOR: I am awake, I think.
SARAH: Shush.
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. Once upon a time, there were three sisters, and they lived at the bottom of a treacle well. Their names were Olga, Masha, and Elena. Are you listening, Tilly?
SARAH: I'm Sarah.
DOCTOR: What?
SARAH: Sarah!
DOCTOR: I feel disorientated.
SARAH: This is the Disorientation Centre.
DOCTOR: That makes sense.
SARAH: Come on!
CHEDAKI : Clear the launching area. Time to countdown, one minute.
DOCTOR: Hurry!
SARAH: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Crayford's ship. It'll be leaving in a moment. Right, right.
SARAH: Doctor!
STYGGRON: The Earth female has escaped. Find her!
DOCTOR: We're going into that rocket, Sarah.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: I said, you and I are going into that rocket!
CHEDAKI : Time to lift off, thirty seconds.
DOCTOR: Come on, Sarah. We need protection or the g-force will crush us on blast off. Come on.
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's not activated.
CHEDAKI : Ten, nine.
CHEDAKI : Eight, seven, six, five.
DOCTOR: Come on, in you go. Quick! Quick!
CHEDAKI : Four, three, two.
 
SARAH: It's okay, I'm in. Hurry!
CHEDAKI : One, zero. 
SARAH: It's crushing me, Doctor. Doctor.
Part Four
DOCTOR: We're on the way.
SARAH: I must have blacked out.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did. The G-force cut the blood supply to what you humans laughingly call your higher centres.
SARAH: Ha ha. I hate sarcasm, especially when I'm dying. I feel as though I've been through a mangle.
DOCTOR: It was a gentle massage compared to what's ahead.
SARAH: Oh, no, don't tell me. I don't want to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do. Just before Crayford puts the ship into re-entry orbit, these containers will be shot out like pips from a lemon.
SARAH: How?
DOCTOR: Through the cargo shuttle ejectors. And we'll be in them.
SARAH: Oh.
DOCTOR: Ask me why.
SARAH: Why?
DOCTOR: Because they'll reach Earth before the ship. There's no other way we can warn the Defence Station.
SARAH: And what are we going to use for air?
DOCTOR: Oh, there'll be enough to last the few minutes in space. I'm more concerned about the efficiency of these retro tubes.
SARAH: Why, don't they work?
DOCTOR: Oh, I imagine they'll work well enough for the androids to survive impact, but we could be in for a nasty jolt.
SARAH: So, providing we don't burn up on re-entry, and aren't suffocated on the way down, we'll probably be smashed to a pulp when we land.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Sarah, you've put your finger on the one tiny flaw in our plan.
SARAH: Our plan? It's your plan.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm open to suggestions if you've got a better idea.
SARAH: How long before we start all this?
DOCTOR: Quite soon. They're beaming us through the space time warp now.
GRIERSON: Bearing one four three.
TESSA: I've got him.
MATTHEWS: There he is!
GRIERSON: Contact confirmed. Well done, Tessa.
MATTHEWS: It's the XK-5 all right, exactly as scheduled.
TESSA: Incredible, isn't it, after two years.
GRIERSON: Colonel Faraday? Ah, hello, sir, this is the scanner room. We've picked up Crayford's ship, sir. Yes, absolutely on the button. Right, sir. The old man's coming down.
BENTON: Well, we've searched the area for them, made enquiries in the village. No sign of the Doctor or Miss Smith anywhere.
HARRY: Well, he'll turn up when he feels like it. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
BENTON: Yes, I just hope you're right.
HARRY: You're a pessimist, Mister Benton. What could possibly happen to the Doctor in Devesham Woods?
BENTON: It's just that I've never known him leave the Tardis with the key in it before.
FARADAY: Come along, men. Crayford's been spotted on the scanners.
HARRY: Oh, that's great, sir.
MATTHEWS: Hello, XK-5, hello, XK-5. This is Devesham Control calling XK-5. Do you read me, do you read me?
GRIERSON: It's on the master scanner, sir. Right on course.
FARADAY: This is a moment for history, Grierson.
GRIERSON: It is that, sir.
HARRY: A two year journey.
FARADAY: He's been further into space than any other human being.
MATTHEWS: XK-5, this is Devesham Control calling XK-5. Do you read me, do you read me?
CRAYFORD :  Come in Mission Control. This is XK-5. I'm receiving you loud and clear.
MATTHEWS: Okay, XK-5. Stand by, stand by.
GRIERSON: Sir, would you care to.?
FARADAY: Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you.
FARADAY: Hello, Crayford. Colonel Faraday here. I, er, well, what can one say at a moment like this, except welcome home.
CRAYFORD : Thank you, sir. Earth certainly looks pretty good from up here. I've had some problem with one of the
FARADAY: What's that? Re-entry?
GRIERSON: Not yet, sir. There's something else coming in on the same path.
FARADAY: Something else?
GRIERSON: There's a fireball or something. It's broken into meteorites, look.
TESSA: They're down to seventeen thousand metres.
FARADAY: Never mind the meteorites. Have we still got contact with the ship?
GRIERSON: He's just hit the upper atmosphere, sir. It looks like a perfect re-entry path.
MATTHEWS: He'll be back in the mess in time for late breakfast.
HARRY: No, he won't, Matthews. Not after two years in space.
MATTHEWS: That meteorite shower's really coming in.
BENTON: Yes, but don't they usually burn up before they hit the Earth?
MATTHEWS: This lot's not going to. There's something funny about them.
FARADAY: Something funny?
MATTHEWS: I swear they're slowing down.
DOCTOR: Sarah? Sarah? No Sarah. No Sarah. No Sarah.
CRAYFORD : XK-5 to control.
HARRY: He's made it.
GRIERSON: He's through.
CRAYFORD : This is XK-5 calling control.
TESSA: Devesham Control to XK-5. We're locking on.
CRAYFORD:  Roger, Devesham.
TESSA: Ignition minus thirty, on my mark. Mark.
CRAYFORD : Mark thirty. AGS reading four hundred plus one.
TESSA: Ten seconds to ignition. Mark.
CRAYFORD : I have ignition, Devesham. Starting descent.
MATTHEWS: Altitude forty thousand metres. Thirty nine, thirty eight thousand. Descent velocity six fifty metres per second.
FARADAY: He'll be landing in a few minutes. Everything you need, Sullivan?
HARRY: I've got the tools of the trade here, sir.
GRIERSON: You're looking good, Commander.
CRAYFORD : Good for me, too. I hope you've got some champagne on ice down there, have you?
SARAH: Doctor?
SARAH: Doctor?
SARAH: Oh! Doctor, don't do things like that.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I had to be sure. You see, there's a replica of you around somewhere.
SARAH: Well, my replica wouldn't be as glad to see you as I am.
SARAH: What's that?
DOCTOR: The rocket is coming in to land.
SARAH: Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to warn them.
DOCTOR: It would suit our purposes better if no one was warned.
SARAH: You're not the real Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Come. We have much to do.
GRIERSON: You're cleared for landing, XK-5.
CRAYFORD : Roger. Coming down now.
MATTHEWS: Coming down nineteen five hundred, at seventeen. Four hundred metres. Two fifty. Two hundred.
TESSA: Slight drift to right.
CRAYFORD : Correcting three forward. Three forward. Easy, easy.
MATTHEWS: Docking contact.
CRAYFORD : Ascent engines command override off. Engine off. That's it, boys, crack the bubbly!
GRIERSON: The XK-5 has landed, sir.
FARADAY: Well done. Well done! Come along, Sullivan. We'll go aboard.
HARRY: Yes, sir.
MATTHEWS: Coffee, anybody?
GRIERSON: Oh, make mine black, please.
MATTHEWS: What about you, Tessa?
BENTON: Can I use your phone, Grierson?
GRIERSON: Yes, of course.
TESSA: Yes, I could really use a coffee.
GRIERSON: Commander Crayford?
GRIERSON : Colonel Faraday and the MO are on their way up now, sir.
CRAYFORD: Thanks. I'll be waiting.
DOCTOR: Can you tell me where I could find the Commanding Officer?
ADAMS: Yes, sir. He's in the scanner room.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
ADAMS: Excuse me, sir. Can I see your pass, please?
DOCTOR: Yes. There we are.
ADAMS: Oh, yes. That's all right, sir, thank you.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Is this the first time you've seen me today?
ADAMS: What? Yes, sir.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, if you do see me again today, I want you to report it to me immediately. I'll be with the CO in the scanner room.
BENTON: Yes, yes. Make it eight o'clock outside the Chinese takeaway. And don't be late.
GRIERSON: You've got her well trained.
BENTON: Yes, well, to be honest with you, it's my kid sister. I'm taking her to a dance at the Palais tonight.
BENTON: Doctor! Where have you been? We've been looking all
DOCTOR: Where's Harry?
BENTON: Mister Sullivan? He's gone up to the rocket with Colonel Faraday.
DOCTOR: Call him down.
GRIERSON: I can't do that, sir.
DOCTOR: Call him down.
BENTON: Better do as he says.
GRIERSON: Hello?
DOCTOR: Give it to me. Harry? Harry, can you hear me?
HARRY : Hello, Doctor. Is that you?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Don't go into that rocket.
FARADAY : I don't understand. What the Dickens is going on?
DOCTOR: Just trust me, Colonel. If you go into that rocket, your lives will be in deadly danger.
FARADAY : Chap's insane.
HARRY : I think we ought to do as he says, Colonel.
DOCTOR: Harry, bring the lift down. I'll explain it all then.
FARADAY : Very well, Doctor, but the explanation had better be good.
GRIERSON: The lift's started down again, sir.
DOCTOR: Good.
MATTHEWS: Mister Benton?
BENTON: Yes?
MATTHEWS: Could you spare a minute, please?
DOCTOR: What controls the angle of your radar dish?
GRIERSON: This one here, sir.
DOCTOR: Give me a pen.
ADAMS: What is going on here?
BENTON 2: Have them taken away.
DOCTOR: Could you do that?
GRIERSON: Well, it's possible. It would take a bit of time, though. I'd have to re-jig about eleven circuits there.
DOCTOR: All right. Well, you get about it.
GRIERSON: You can't
DOCTOR: Tell no one what you're doing.
GRIERSON: You can't point the radar dishes down here, sir! They'd jam every radio and electronic equipment for miles. There'd be chaos.
DOCTOR: Nothing like the chaos there'll be if you don't do it, Grierson.
FARADAY: Doctor! What the devil's going on?
DOCTOR: An invasion of Earth is going on, Colonel.
FARADAY: What?
DOCTOR: Let's go to your office. You've got some important phone calls to make. Crayford's sold you out to the Kraals.
FARADAY: Kraals? Never heard of them.
HARRY: You've actually seen these androids, then, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Indeed I have.
FARADAY: I'll not have my command infiltrated by aliens.
HARRY: Sir, they may already be among us.
DOCTOR: They've made replicas of you and Harry, Colonel.
FARADAY: Of me?
DOCTOR: Yes.
FARADAY: Confounded cheek. How dare they!
HARRY: Colonel, I think I should run a complete medical check on everyone.
FARADAY: Good idea, Sullivan. That'll nail 'em, eh, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, but it would take too long. We can use this.
HARRY: What's that?
DOCTOR: It's a robot detector. It lights up in the presence of androids.
FARADAY: Thing must be faulty.
DOCTOR: I don't think so. I see I was just too late.
DOCTOR 2: A pity you had to find out.
DOCTOR 2: We didn't want any shooting until our takeover was complete.
DOCTOR: Hello, Doctor. We've been waiting for you.
DOCTOR 2: Stand back, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You know, the resemblance is astonishing. For a moment, I thought I was seeing double.
SARAH: Doctor, this way!
FARADAY 2: Attention, attention.
FARADAY 2 : It has been confirmed the Doctor is attempting to sabotage our defence system. He is at large somewhere inside the complex.
FARADAY 2 : Saturation search will begin at once. He is armed and dangerous, and all personnel have the authority to shoot on sight. That is all.
SARAH: So the androids have taken over.
DOCTOR: Looks like.
SARAH: What about the real Harry and Colonel Faraday?
DOCTOR: They must be up there in the rocket with Styggron.
SARAH: We've got to help them somehow.
DOCTOR: Our only chance is to stop the androids before they take over the complex.
SARAH: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: To the scanner room. You stay here, Sarah.
BENTON 2: Hold it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool, Benton, I'm one of you. Didn't you hear the Colonel just now? The Doctor's not here, he's at large somewhere in the complex.
BENTON 2: Oh yes, of course, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
DOCTOR: That's all right, Benton, but keep your wits about you. Nobody knows who's who around here.
DOCTOR: Have you finished, Grierson?
GRIERSON: Almost there, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on. We haven't got a second to lose, man.
BENTON 2: Hold it, Doctor.
DOCTOR 2: Don't be a fool, Benton, I'm one of you.
DOCTOR 2: Satisfied?
BENTON 2: But I, but I thought you were. He passed me just a minute ago.
DOCTOR 2: Which way did he go?
BENTON 2: To the scanner room.
GRIERSON: There. I've done it.
GRIERSON: All I have to do now is switch on the power.
DOCTOR: Good.
DOCTOR 2: A clever way to jam android circuits, but not quick enough.
CRAYFORD: What's going on?
DOCTOR 2: The Doctor has interfered in our plans for the last time.
CRAYFORD: But Styggron promised me there would be no killing.
DOCTOR 2: Fool. Do you really think the Kraals will spare humanity? Styggron has a virus in your ship that will destroy every man, woman and child in the world.
CRAYFORD: Styggron wouldn't do that. He's a surgeon, a genius. Look what he did for me!
DOCTOR: He did nothing for you, Crayford. Absolutely nothing at all. Except brainwash you.
CRAYFORD: That's not true.
DOCTOR: You were hijacked by the Kraals, Crayford. Nothing went wrong with your rocket, Crayford. You weren't even injured. Take off the eye patch and look for yourself.
HARRY 2: The scanner room.
SARAH: Harry?
HARRY: Sarah? Sarah, where
SARAH: Harry!
HARRY: What's going on?
SARAH: It's a long story. For a start, you've got a very nasty twin.
HARRY: Twin?
DOCTOR: Are you all right?
GRIERSON: Yeah, I think so, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good.
DOCTOR: Where's Crayford?
GRIERSON: He went back to the rocket.
DOCTOR: Did he? 
FARADAY: It's all very well, but what are these androids?
SARAH: Shush! I keep telling you. They're robots controlled by Styggron.
STYGGRON: The enterprising Earth girl! No! Don't move. The sensors indicated an intruder. I hardly expected to find it was you.
SARAH: No, I suppose you thought I was still a prisoner on your planet.
STYGGRON: I know the Doctor managed to escape, but you must indeed have a charmed life.
SARAH: What are you getting at?
STYGGRON: You were to have been the first human victim of the billions to be destroyed by this virus.
STYGGRON: How did you escape death? Did you not drink the water?
SARAH: Water.
CRAYFORD: Styggron! You have betrayed me.
STYGGRON: Betrayed you? I used you, Crayford, as I use the androids, but you are no longer of any value.
DOCTOR: Excuse me.
SARAH: Doctor! Oh, no!
DOCTOR: Don't waste any tears on him, Sarah. He's only an android.
SARAH: An android?
DOCTOR: Yes, my replica. I reprogrammed it to confuse Styggron.
SARAH: Please, don't ever do anything like that again.
DOCTOR: Come on.
SARAH: Oh, how could we ever have been fooled?
DOCTOR: How do you mean?
SARAH: Well, this really is Earth.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
DOCTOR: After you.
SARAH: Uh uh. I'm going home, and I'm going by taxi.
DOCTOR: Oh. I'll make you an offer. I'll take you home.
SARAH: How can I refuse?
