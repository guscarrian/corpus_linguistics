Earthshock
Part One
MITCHELL: Nothing.
KYLE: How does this thing work?
WALTERS: It focuses on the electrical activity of the body. Er, heartbeat, things like that.
SCOTT: But only of mammalian lifeform. Everything else is excluded.
WALTERS: Nothing.
SCOTT: Could they be shielded from the scanner in any way?
WALTERS: A lead screen. Some of the newer alloys.
KYLE: There isn't anything like that in the cavern. They're dead, aren't they?
SCOTT: It does seem likely.
KYLE: Such a pointless waste.
SCOTT: Yeah, well, we'll find out.
KYLE: They can't be far. I radioed immediately I left the cavern.
SCOTT: You've done all you can. Don't upset yourself. Walters, scan again. Maximum amplification.
WALTERS: Right, sir.
MITCHELL: How many of you were there down there?
KYLE: Eight of us.
MITCHELL: What were you doing?
KYLE: A survey. The particular cave system we were in has just been discovered. It's proven to be rich in fossils.
SCOTT: Are you all palaeontologists?
KYLE: And geologists.
SCOTT: It doesn't make sense.
WALTERS: Scan complete, sir. Negative. No sign of life.
SCOTT : Right, get your gear together.
SCOTT: We're going down. I realise going down again must be hard.
KYLE: The caves are uncharted. You'll never find the bodies without my help.
SCOTT: I'm grateful. Snyder, I want you to stay here with Walters.
SNYDER: Sir.
SCOTT: Walters, I want a constant scan.
WALTERS: Right, sir.
SCOTT: Let me know the instant you see anything, right?
MITCHELL: Troops ready, sir.
SCOTT: Oh, Sergeant Mitchell, do you believe Professor Kyle?
MITCHELL: I think she's telling the truth. As far as she knows it, that is.
SCOTT: I agree. All right, put the troop on full alert.
MITCHELL: Sir.
SCOTT: Oh, and just in case she is lying, we'll have her up front where we can see her.
SNYDER: The party's making good progress.
SNYDER: Is that supposed to happen?
WALTERS: What?
SNYDER: It was a sort of flare. It only lasted a second.
WALTERS: Oh, probably nothing. This equipment's ancient.
SNYDER: There!
WALTERS: Ghosting.
SNYDER: Shouldn't we tell Lieutenant Scott?
WALTERS: It isn't worth it.
DOCTOR: You must read this, Adric. The Black Orchid.
ADRIC: Why?
DOCTOR: It's fascinating. Such scholarship.
ADRIC: Why should that interest me?
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ADRIC: I'm fed up.
DOCTOR: Why?
ADRIC: I'm tired of being considered a joke.
DOCTOR: Oh, no one thinks that.
ADRIC: Then why am I constantly teased?
DOCTOR: Well, everyone's teased from time to time.
ADRIC: Yeah, but not as often as me.
DOCTOR: That's not true.
ADRIC: No, and I suppose neither is the fact that whenever Nyssa or Tegan ask you a question you always find time to answer it, but hardly ever with me. Oh look, Doctor, how am I to learn if you never find time to explain?
DOCTOR: Time? We have spent many hours discussing and debating endless topics.
ADRIC: I'm just fitted in when it's convenient for you.
DOCTOR: All right, I'll make more time.
ADRIC: No, you've said that too often before, Doctor. There will always be some distraction to prevent it happening.
DOCTOR: I give you my word.
ADRIC: Just as you gave your word to Tegan.
DOCTOR: That's not fair.
ADRIC: No, it never is when you're being criticised, is it. Just as it's never your fault when something goes wrong.
DOCTOR: Have you quite finished?
ADRIC: There's lots more!
DOCTOR: Well, it can wait!
ADRIC: Yes, but I can't.
ADRIC: I'm tired of being an outsider, Doctor. I want to go back to my own people.
SCOTT: Is this the only way down?
KYLE: The only known way.
SCOTT: You must have had some fun getting the gear through there.
KYLE: The expedition was cursed from the beginning.
SCOTT: Oh?
KYLE: We had endless problems. Even lighting the tunnels was a nightmare.
MITCHELL: In what way?
KYLE: All sorts of things. Annoying things. The tools would go missing. Small but important components would be discovered smashed.
SCOTT: Sabotage?
KYLE: I didn't think so at the time. Someone wanting to wreck the expedition could have been far more positive about it.
SCOTT: As ultimately they were.
NYSSA: There.
TEGAN: I'll never learn how to do that properly.
NYSSA: It isn't difficult.
DOCTOR : No, Adric, I will not do it!
ADRIC : You've done it before!
DOCTOR: The Tardis is not designed for E-space! Nyssa, tell him!
NYSSA: Tell him what?
DOCTOR: He wants to go home!
NYSSA: To Alzarius?
ADRIC: No, to Terradon.
DOCTOR: And that would involve the Tardis going back into E-space.
NYSSA: The Doctor's right. It would be very dangerous.
ADRIC: I could plot a course.
DOCTOR: How do you calculate negative coordinates?
ADRIC: I have the mathematical skill.
DOCTOR: It would also involve passing through the CVE. Now, you can't calculate random coordinates.
ADRIC: The Monitor on Logopolis indicated they were not random.
DOCTOR: You do not have the Monitor's skill, Adric, and even if you did, I am not going back into E-space!
ADRIC: Then I will find someone who will take me!
DOCTOR: E-space is another universe. There isn't a taxi service goes back and forth.
ADRIC: Once I've calculated the course, the journey itself would be simple.
NYSSA: It won't.
ADRIC: Romana's still in E-space. Once I get there, she can help me.
TEGAN: Is it really that dangerous?
DOCTOR: Do you really think I'd be making all this fuss if it weren't?
ADRIC: Can I use your computer?
DOCTOR: Oh, help yourself. I'm not waiting around while you plot the course to your own destruction.
SCOTT: How much further?
SCOTT: What caused that?
KYLE: I don't know. They've never done it before.
MITCHELL: Trooper Bane's hurt, sir.
BANE: I've damaged my shoulder.
MITCHELL: Nothing broken.
SCOTT: Can you walk?
BANE: I think so.
SCOTT: Good.
WALTERS : Walters.
SCOTT: Bane's had an accident. I'm sending her up.
WALTERS : Right, sir.
SCOTT: She'll need medical treatment
SCOTT: What's that?
WALTERS: I don't know, sir. It's causing the scanner to flare as well.
SCOTT: See if you can trace it, will you?
SCOTT: Too late.
KYLE: I've heard that noise before.
SCOTT: When?
KYLE: A few minutes before we were attacked.
NYSSA: Where are we?
DOCTOR: Earth.
NYSSA: Oh, not again.
DOCTOR: Twenty sixth century.
ADRIC: The year is 2526 in the time scale you call Anno Domini.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
TEGAN: Why have we materialised underground?
DOCTOR: Why not? Adric wants to use the computer, I want to go for a walk.
NYSSA: Why not help Adric?
ADRIC: I don't need his help, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You see?
NYSSA: Please, Doctor, it's gone far enough.
ADRIC: Do you know, I think since his regeneration, he's become decidedly immature.
DOCTOR: I'm going outside now. I might be gone some time.
TEGAN: I'm going to talk some sense into the Doctor.
NYSSA: Oh dear, it's all getting rather silly, isn't it.
ADRIC: Oh, I didn't mean to be so rude.
NYSSA: Look, why don't you calculate the course home? Show the Doctor it can be done. Then when he's calmed down, we can all talk to him.
ADRIC: But will he listen?
NYSSA: Of course he will.
WALTERS: This is the main group here. This is the wounded party.
SNYDER: Where have they come from?
WALTERS: I don't know.
SCOTT : Scott.
SNYDER: We have three unidentified lifeforms on the scanner.
WALTERS: One of the readings is ectopic, sir.
SCOTT : What does that mean?
WALTERS: That one of the lifeforms has two hearts.
DOCTOR: So peaceful and cool down here.
TEGAN: Breathe deeply and relax. Now, go and make it up with Adric, please?
DOCTOR: All right, but I'm not taking him back into E-space, and that's my final word on the matter.
NYSSA: Look at his calculations before you decide. It may be possible.
DOCTOR: All right, I'll look, but I'm not promising anything.
NYSSA: Of course not, Doctor.
SCOTT: You're sure the lifeform's alien?
WALTERS: Positive, sir. I've rechecked the scan. The reading's true.
SCOTT: Let me have their position as soon as possible.
WALTERS : Working it out now, sir.
SCOTT: Unshoulder arms. Set them on stun.
DOCTOR: Now, look here, Adric
TEGAN: Doctor? There's something wrong.
DOCTOR: What?
TEGAN: Well, haven't you noticed?
NYSSA: What are you talking about?
TEGAN: Well, it should be totally dark, but we can see.
DOCTOR: Phosphorescence.
NYSSA: And something else.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
NYSSA: Lots of bones.
WALTERS: I've worked out the position of the three intruders. Their lateral coordinates are zero three nine by four zero one.
WALTERS : Depth coordinates twenty three point three three six metres. Reference one nine by seven four point nine.
KYLE: By my reckoning, your alien lifeform is in a small tunnel alongside the cavern where we were attacked.
BANE: I must rest for a moment.
SNYDER: Look at the wounded party. They've hardly moved. I'm going down.
WALTERS: Why?
SNYDER: They may need help.
WALTERS: I'll let them know you're coming.
DOCTOR: Fascinating!
NYSSA: They're huge. What sort of creature had such bones?
TEGAN: Dinosaurs.
DOCTOR: An amazing species.
NYSSA: Are they your ancestors?
TEGAN: I hope not!
DOCTOR: You should be proud if they were.
TEGAN: Oh, thank you very much. Most of them had a brain the size of a pea.
DOCTOR: They were also the most successful creature ever to inhabit the Earth.
NYSSA: In what way?
DOCTOR: Fossilised remains have been found all over the planet. Not bad adaptation for a creature with a brain the size of a pea.
NYSSA: How long did they exist?
DOCTOR: Hundred million years or so. They seemed so secure and yet they died out virtually overnight.
SCOTT: Come on, Professor.
TEGAN: It's like a graveyard.
NYSSA: How could such a successful species die out so quickly?
DOCTOR: Initially hypothermia, then starvation.
NYSSA: Caused by what, an ice age?
DOCTOR: Something equally as devastating. The Earth collided with something from space.
TEGAN: An asteroid.
DOCTOR: Could be. I don't know. I've always meant to slip back and find out.
SNYDER: Snyder.
WALTERS: You should be near the wounded party.
SNYDER : I can't see anyone.
WALTERS: They're on your level, about thirty metres away.
SNYDER: Advancing now. Will leave communicator on.
BANE: Is that you, Snyder?
SNYDER: Are you sure they're on this level?
WALTERS : Positive.
WALTERS: They should be very close. Hang on, the scanner's flaring. The flaring's very heavy.
SNYDER : See if you can get a fix on it.
MITCHELL: Come on, keep up! The exercise will do you all good!
WALTERS: Snyder, do you hear me?
SNYDER: Just.
WALTERS: It's no go. The scanner registers the flare, but the computer doesn't. It's weird.
SNYDER: Keep trying.
WALTERS : You must be very close to the source.
WALTERS: Snyder? Snyder!
WALTERS: Negative emission. Snyder, do you hear me?
WALTERS : Get out of there! Bane and Collis are dead! Do you hear me? Snyder! Snyder! Get out of there, Snyder!
TEGAN: Things have collided with the Earth before. What was so different about the one that destroyed the dinosaurs?
DOCTOR: It's size. It was gigantic.
TEGAN: But how could one asteroid wipe out all the dinosaurs? It just isn't possible.
NYSSA: You're forgetting displacement.
DOCTOR: The impact would have caused millions upon millions of tons of earth and rock to be fragmented and then hurled up into the atmosphere, enveloping the whole planet.
NYSSA: The storm it created must have lasted for months.
TEGAN: Would it have blocked out the sun?
DOCTOR: To such an extent that the surface temperature would have dropped radically.
NYSSA: And without warmth, reptiles cease to function.
TEGAN: Poor old dinosaur.
SCOTT: All right, all right, take it easy.
KYLE: I can't keep the pace up.
SCOTT: We'll rest here for a minute.
SCOTT: Scott.
WALTERS : Snyder and the others have just gone off the scanner.
SCOTT: What?
WALTERS: The screen flared again and then their scan lights went out.
WALTERS : They're dead.
SCOTT: Have you checked the scanner for faults?
WALTERS: Yes. It's working perfectly.
MITCHELL: Could be a rock fall that killed them.
SCOTT: Any change in position of our alien friends ahead?
WALTERS : None.
MITCHELL: Shall I take a couple of troopers and go back, sir?
SCOTT: Carry on, Sergeant Mitchell.
MITCHELL: Carter, Bailey.
ADRIC: Don't wander too far, Doctor.
SCOTT: Professor Kyle, we must go on.
KYLE: I'm fine now.
SCOTT: Right, prepare to move out.
TEGAN: It's weird. It all happened so long ago.
DOCTOR: Sixty five million years.
TEGAN: I wonder what evolutionary stage my ancestors were at?
DOCTOR: Primitive, Tegan. Very primitive.
MITCHELL:  Come on.
WALTERS: Not again. Please, not again.
MITCHELL: Mitchell.
WALTERS : The scanner's flared again, Sarge.
MITCHELL: Whereabouts?
WALTERS : Very close to you.
KYLE: There's been a rockfall.
SCOTT: Where are the three aliens?
KYLE: In the tunnel down here.
SCOTT: Right, take cover.
MITCHELL: Come on.
CARTER: Look, Sarge. What sort of weapon can do that to a person.
MITCHELL: I don't know and I don't care. I just want the people who did this.
MITCHELL : We've company. Two of them.
WALTERS: That's not possible. There's no reading.
MITCHELL : Just take my word for it. They're here all right and they don't look Argh!
WALTERS: Sergeant? Sergeant Mitchell? Sergeant! Sergeant Mitchell!
TEGAN: Look, Doctor. Mining equipment.
DOCTOR: Er, I don't think we should go any further.
NYSSA: I can't see anyone.
SCOTT: Hold it there!
TEGAN: What's going on?
SCOTT: Shut up! Do you recognise any of them?
KYLE: No.
DOCTOR: How do you do. I'm the Doctor. This is Tegan and Nyssa.
SCOTT: I said, shut up.
DOCTOR: What are we supposed to have done?
SCOTT: Scott.
WALTERS : Sergeant Mitchell and her troops are dead, sir.
SCOTT: Are you sure?
WALTERS: Yes, sir. She was reporting in when she was killed.
SCOTT: How many hostiles were there?
WALTERS : Two, sir.
SCOTT: And where are they now?
WALTERS: I don't know, sir. They didn't show up on the scanner.
SCOTT: Why, that's impossible!
WALTERS : I know, sir.
SCOTT: All right, keep searching. Let me know when you find anything.
DOCTOR: Anything we can do?
DOCTOR: Obviously not.
SCOTT: Too many people have died for you to play the fool.
ADRIC: Now where have you gone?
SCOTT: Where have you hidden the bodies?
DOCTOR: What bodies?
SCOTT: Seven people were murdered in this cavern.
TEGAN: We didn't do it.
DOCTOR: We've only just arrived.
NYSSA: Let me show you how we travelled here.
SCOTT: Don't waste my time. Where have you hidden the bodies?
KYLE: The rock fall!
SCOTT: What?
KYLE: The bodies must be here!
SCOTT: Shall we look?
ADRIC: What is it? Where's it coming from?
SCOTT: What's that?
NYSSA: I don't know.
SCOTT: Seaton, Foster, help them clear the rocks away.
KYLE: Lieutenant!
KYLE: These belonged to Doctor Khan, my assistant.
SCOTT: Is this why you killed them?
DOCTOR: I know nothing about it.
TEGAN: We're telling the truth.
SCOTT: Open the hatch.
DOCTOR: I can't.
SCOTT: I said, open it.
NYSSA: I'll try.
DOCTOR: Nyssa.
SCOTT: You stay where you are. I want him to do it.
SCOTT: Take cover! Take cover! Behind the rocks!
KYLE: Who are they?
DOCTOR: Androids. That's why they didn't register on your scanners.
SCOTT: Androids. Are they yours?
DOCTOR: No. If you want proof, you'll find they'll kill me as willingly as they'll kill you. See what I mean?
KYLE: That's them. I recognise that sound.
SCOTT: Those are the things that attacked you?
KYLE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Do you know why?
KYLE: No, there isn't a reason.
DOCTOR: Whoever's controlling the android thinks there is.
LEADER: Destroy them! Destroy them at once!
Part Two
SCOTT: Our weapons have no effect on them.
DOCTOR: Yes, they will, but you must concentrate your fire.
SCOTT: All right, hold your fire. When I give the word, go for the one on the right. Now!
SCOTT: Got him!
DOCTOR: No, it's only damaged.
CYBERMAN: The androids are too valuable to waste. We may still need them.
LEADER: They are programmed for self-preservation. They will not take any more unnecessary risks.
KYLE: Will they attack again?
DOCTOR: Undoubtedly.
SCOTT: They've covered the exit.
TEGAN: Won't someone on the surface realise that something's wrong?
SCOTT: Sooner or later.
TEGAN: Let's hope it's sooner.
SCOTT: What are they doing?
DOCTOR: Waiting.
KYLE: What can they possibly want?
TEGAN: Isn't it obvious? Us dead.
KYLE: But why?
DOCTOR: Were you working near the rockfall the first time you were attacked?
KYLE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well, maybe their function is to protect that hatch.
KYLE: What could be in there that's worth so many lives?
DOCTOR: Let's find out.
SCOTT: I haven't had much experience of fighting androids.
DOCTOR: Oh, they're just like people.
NYSSA: Only they function much more logically.
DOCTOR: Which can be their weakness.
ADRIC: Doctor! Doctor!
NYSSA: Oh, no.
TEGAN: Adric.
DOCTOR: Adric!
TROOPER: Lieutenant!
SCOTT: The powerpacks for the rifles are almost finished.
TEGAN: So are we.
DOCTOR: Brave heart, Tegan. Now, the androids are programmed to protect that hatch. In order to carry out that duty successfully, it's important they remain operational.
SCOTT: Go on.
DOCTOR: Well, the androids now know we have the ability to inflict serious on them, so if we attack that hatch, we create a dilemma.
NYSSA: We attack what they're programmed to defend.
KYLE: Why should they care if we attack the hatch.
NYSSA: They won't care, they'll react. They've no choice.
DOCTOR: The conflict between duty and survival should cause enough confusion in their logic circuits for them to start making mistakes, which is exactly what we want.
SCOTT: I hope you're right.
DOCTOR: Well, let's find out.
SCOTT: Right. Stand by. Fire!
CYBERMAN: The Earthlings are attempting to break through the hatch.
LEADER: Are their weapons capable?
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: They must be stopped immediately.
DOCTOR: Well done!
SCOTT: Who's that boy?
DOCTOR: It's Adric.
LEADER: Is the second android fitted with visual monitoring?
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: Then activate.
LEADER: We must act quickly. Prepare to activate the device.
CYBERMAN: It's too soon, Leader.
LEADER: We must be prepared.
SCOTT: Very good shooting indeed. Well done.
NYSSA: It's very primitive.
DOCTOR: You think so?
NYSSA: Look at this.
DOCTOR: Lieutenant?
SCOTT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I think you should curtail the celebrations for the time being.
SCOTT: Oh, something wrong?
DOCTOR: We must get this hatch open.
SCOTT: What's the hurry?
NYSSA: One of the androids was a massive ultrasonic transmitter.
ADRIC: So that was the signal I picked up in the Tardis.
SCOTT: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Whoever built this hatch now knows we've destroyed its guardians.
CYBERMAN: Carrier signal now being transmitted. Beam locked on.
DOCTOR: Ow! Your troopers got quite carried away, didn't they. I would suggest you get your people well back. The hatch may be booby-trapped.
SCOTT: What about you?
DOCTOR: Well, my arms are only this long. I can't get any further away.
NYSSA: Can you see what it is?
DOCTOR: No. You'd better get back, too.
SCOTT: Right, everybody back.
LEADER: Activate the computer.
CYBERMAN: It's too early, Leader. It will be wasted.
LEADER: The device is already lost. Let the Earth see the effectiveness of Cyber technology. Explode the bomb.
DOCTOR: Ah, got it. The release mechanism. You'd better get back too.
ADRIC: You've checked for booby traps.
DOCTOR: I'm not in the mood to argue.
SCOTT: Come on, lad.
DOCTOR: Further than that!
CYBERMAN: The Earthlings have broken in!
LEADER: They are too late.
NYSSA: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEGAN: We thought a booby trap had gone off.
DOCTOR: Oh.
KYLE: What is it?
DOCTOR: A bomb. My opening the hatch has started up the arming procedure. You'd better let your people on the surface know what's happened.
SCOTT: How much time have we got?
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Tegan, get everyone into the Tardis.
TEGAN: Come on, into the Tardis. This way. 
SCOTT: Scott to Walters. Walters, come in please. Walters!
ADRIC: Come on. You can't stay behind!
DOCTOR: It was my own stupidity that started it off. The least I can do is to. Of course! Come on!
LEADER: How much longer before activation?
CYBERMAN: One minute.
DOCTOR: Set the coordinates at zero!
ADRIC: It would be nice to know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: The arming procedure on the bomb is being operated by remote control.
ADRIC: Can you jam it?
DOCTOR: Yes, but not till I know where it's coming from.
LEADER: Master detonator engaged.
DOCTOR: Well, that isn't right. Or is it?
TEGAN: How long does an arming procedure take?
DOCTOR: Not long.
TEGAN: Shouldn't we move the Tardis in case the bomb goes off?
CYBERMAN: Thirty seconds.
LEADER: What's happening?
CYBERMAN: Our signal is being jammed.
LEADER: More power!
DOCTOR: Come on, Adric, hurry!
ADRIC: But you've already jammed the signal.
DOCTOR: If they increase power, they could break through.
CYBERMAN: Supplementary power on.
LEADER: Hurry.
CYBERMAN: Power building.
DOCTOR: Magnetic clamp.
ADRIC: Magnetic clamp. How much damage could this bomb do?
DOCTOR: Enough.
ADRIC: Enough for what?
DOCTOR: To make life intolerable for the few who survived.
NYSSA: Oh, no.
TEGAN: What's the matter?
NYSSA: Whoever they are, they're fighting back.
DOCTOR: Probe.
ADRIC: Probe. Do you know, I find this whole situation so bizarre. I mean, there's just no purpose to it.
DOCTOR: Well, there is somewhere. We just don't have enough of the pieces yet.
ADRIC: Look, Professor Kyle said she'd been down here four weeks before the androids attacked.
DOCTOR: Laser cutter.
ADRIC: Laser cutter.
DOCTOR: Why, you think they should have attacked earlier?
ADRIC: It would have made more sense if they had.
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. The androids are programmed to protect this hatch. Now, the cave system is enormous. Why draw attention to yourselves and your charge by attacking on the first day?
ADRIC: Yes, I suppose that has a certain logic.
DOCTOR: Magnetic drone.
ADRIC: Magnetic drone.
DOCTOR: There was power in that circuit!
ADRIC: What's happened?
DOCTOR: The signal's breaking through.
NYSSA: That's it. Maximum output.
TEGAN: There must be more. The Tardis has limitless power.
NYSSA: But the transmitter doesn't.
DOCTOR: I think drastic action is called for.
ADRIC: But there can't be much time left. What can we do? 
DOCTOR: Abandon methodical procedure for blind instinct. Laser cutter!
ADRIC: Laser cutter.
CYBERMAN: Full power.
LEADER: We proceed towards the destruction of Earth.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Right or wrong, here we go.
CYBERMAN: Our signal has broken through.
LEADER: Excellent.
LEADER: A fault?
CYBERMAN: No, Leader. The bomb has been deactivated!
LEADER: That can't be. Cyber technology is too advanced for Earthlings.
NYSSA: It's stopped.
TEGAN: What?
NYSSA: It's stopped. They've stopped transmitting. The Doctor's done it!
CYBERMAN: But how did they succeed, Leader?
LEADER: They have been helped. We have been betrayed. Whoever has done this must be found and destroyed at once.
DOCTOR: Tell me, Adric. Why a bomb?
ADRIC: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Why a bomb and not a missile or some other device, and why these particular caves? There's a reason.
ADRIC: It's not our problem, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, isn't it.
LEADER: I should have realised sooner that the Earthlings had help.
CYBERMAN: There's nothing on this replay to indicate who it might be.
LEADER: What is that? I know that object.
DOCTOR: Right. The bomb is deactivated. Your own scientists can dismantle it. Good luck.
SCOTT: But you must stay, Doctor.
KYLE: You've done so much. We want to show you our gratitude.
DOCTOR: Well, thank you, thank you, but we must go. Still a great deal to do.
TEGAN: Haven't we done enough for one day?
ADRIC: You could afford to spare them a few hours, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, there isn't time.
TEGAN: Where are we rushing off to?
DOCTOR: Sector sixteen.
NYSSA: That's deep space.
TEGAN: Sounds great fun.
ADRIC: The Doctor wants us to meet the people who built the androids.
SCOTT: Do you know where they are?
DOCTOR: Er, no, just from where their signal originated.
SCOTT: Then you must let us come with you.
NYSSA: We can't fight androids by ourselves.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm hoping that won't be necessary.
SCOTT: If my planet is being threatened, I would like to do something to help.
KYLE: Indeed.
DOCTOR: All right.
CYBERMAN: What is it?
LEADER: A Tardis.
CYBERMAN: A Time Lord. But they're forbidden to interfere.
LEADER: This one calls himself the Doctor, and does nothing else but interfere.
DOCTOR 1 : Emotions. Love, pride, hate, fear. Have you no emotions then?
LEADER: It was in this regenerated form that he confined the Cybermen to their ice tomb on Telos.
DOCTOR 2 : I imagine you have orders to destroy me.
LEADER: And as this, he defeated us in our attempt to destroy Voga, the planet of gold.
DOCTOR 4 : You've no home planet, no influence, nothing. You're just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers skulking about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship.
CYBERMAN: I did not see any of these men in the cave.
LEADER: It appears he has regenerated again, but whatever his form, he must be found and destroyed.
SCOTT: It's bigger than you think.
DOCTOR: Er, Adric?
ADRIC: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Do you have a moment?
ADRIC: I'm hungry.
DOCTOR: Well, you can join the others later.
ADRIC: Well?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm very grateful for your help with deactivating the bomb.
ADRIC: That's all right.
DOCTOR: It was very brave of you also, the way you tackled the android.
ADRIC: All part of the daily routine.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Look, I've been thinking about your wish to return home.
ADRIC: And?
DOCTOR: Well, I thought that if we could work out a satisfactory course, I might give it a try.
ADRIC: Well, I've already done so, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Really?
ADRIC: As you can see here, I've even managed to calculate the way into the CVE, the gateway through E-space.
DOCTOR: You've done extremely well.
ADRIC: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Look, er, I'm sorry about our argument earlier.
ADRIC: So am I. I over-reacted.
DOCTOR: Do you really want to go home?
ADRIC: No, of course not. There's nothing there for me any more.
DOCTOR: So you've done all these calculations for nothing.
ADRIC: Well, it made a point, didn't it? Besides, who knows? I might change my mind again.
CYBERMAN: Our deep space probes have identified the Tardis.
LEADER: Destination?
CYBERMAN: The freighter.
LEADER: Excellent! Our contingency plans can go ahead. The attack on Earth will proceed accordingly.
RINGWAY: The captain's been on the space station a long time.
BERGER: Everything will be all right.
RINGWAY: Well, I wish I had your confidence. Three men have disappeared in the last two weeks. It would take just one word from a disgruntled member of the crew and this ship would be stuck here for months pending an enquiry.
BERGER: They won't say anything. They know if we don't deliver on time it'll cost them their bonus.
RINGWAY: I wouldn't be so certain. Morale is very low.
BERGER: And with every negative thought you have, Ringway, it sinks even lower. You're supposed to be an officer. Smile when you talk to the crew. Reassure them.
RINGWAY: Security scan in section fifteen is still non-functional.
BERGER: Oh, for heaven's sake.
BERGER: Bridge.
VANCE : The captain is about to come on board.
BERGER: Thank you. Now, isn't that good news?
KYLE: This is where the beam came from?
DOCTOR: As near as I've been able to trace it.
NYSSA: The freighter could be nothing more than a relay point.
DOCTOR: And the crew entirely innocent of what's going on. So, we'll start with a recce.
ADRIC: May I come?
DOCTOR: You're sure?
ADRIC: Yes.
LEADER: Excellent.
ADRIC: Which way?
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think it really matters.
BRIGGS: Take that straight to my cabin.
VANCE: Captain.
RINGWAY: Welcome aboard, ma'am.
BRIGGS: Don't call me ma'am on the bridge.
RINGWAY: Sorry, Captain.
BRIGGS: Get that transponder code fed into the navigational computer at once. I want to get underway.
RINGWAY: Yes, Captain.
BRIGGS: Seven hours they kept me waiting. Seven hours! I'm exhausted.
BERGER: Where there problems with security?
BRIGGS: Earth's on red alert. Some interstellar conference. That's why they're checking that bit more carefully.
BERGER: It explains why we were scanned half a dozen times.
BRIGGS: Well, there'll be no more problems from now on. I've got a clearance straight through to Earth. Our bonus is safe.
RINGWAY: There was no mention of the missing crewmembers?
BERGER: Mister Ringway was concerned that might be the reason for you being delayed.
BRIGGS: Oh, panicking again, was he? No, no mention, Mister Ringway.
RINGWAY: I just happen to think that the disappearance of three crewmembers' rather important, that's all.
BRIGGS: So do I, Mister, but it's something that can be settled when we get back to Earth and our cargo's delivered safely. Understood? Make ready to get underway. If it makes you any happier, double the patrols. I don't want any mention of this. You're beginning to bore me.
SCOTT: I should have gone with him.
NYSSA: The Doctor'll be all right.
TEGAN: What's that?
NYSSA: The freighter's gone into warp drive.
VANCE: I don't fancy walking around that lot.
BRIGGS: Who's on first watch?
BERGER: I am, Captain.
BRIGGS: I wish you luck. I'm going to my cabin.
RINGWAY: I thought I'd check the security patrols.
BRIGGS: You do that, Mister. I'm sure they'd appreciate it.
RINGWAY: Why is she always running me down?
BERGER: I'll give you a bit of advice. You shouldn't sound so earnest all the time.
VANCE: You could hide an army down here and no one would find it.
CARSON: What's that?
VANCE: What?
CARSON: It's gone. I'm sure I saw something move.
VANCE: Where?
CARSON: By silo sixteen
VANCE: Are you sure?
CARSON: Let's look.
ADRIC: Look, aren't we being a bit casual about this?
DOCTOR: There's no one about. The ship's totally automated.
ADRIC: There must be a crew.
DOCTOR: A small one, somewhere.
ADRIC: Yeah, but not down here. Look, what's the point in going on?
DOCTOR: I want to announce my presence, to see what the reaction is.
ADRIC: Then how will they know we're here?
LEADER: Report.
VOICE : The freighter has received full security clearance for its journey to Earth.
LEADER: Excellent.
VOICE : There is one problem. The disappearance of the three crewmembers has caused a lot of unrest.
LEADER: Get your minions to search the hold. You will find a scapegoat there.
VOICE : Leader?
LEADER: You have intruders!
ADRIC: I don't like being so far from the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Someone should have seen us by now.
ADRIC: Look, why don't we go back?
DOCTOR: Minute or two more.
RINGWAY: Ringway to Vance. Report, please.
VANCE: This is Vance, sir.
RINGWAY: Report position.
VANCE: Low walkway, just passing silo five two nine. We've spotted someone, sir.
RINGWAY : Then apprehend him. I'll be down directly.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ADRIC: I've got the feeling we were spotted rather a long time ago.
DOCTOR: We're being followed?
VANCE: We've lost him.
CARSON: No, we haven't.
BERGER: Sorry to disturb you, Captain, but we have intruders in the hold.
BRIGGS : I'll come up right away.
VANCE: Where did he go?
CARSON: This way. There!
ADRIC: Why won't they show themselves?
ADRIC: What's happening?
DOCTOR: Over there!
BRIGGS: Have you got them yet?
BERGER: No, Captain.
BRIGGS: Why not?
BERGER: They're out of camera range.
BRIGGS: I don't want to lose them. Sound the general alarm. I want them caught.
ADRIC: Doctor! Doctor, over here.
DOCTOR: They're finished.
ADRIC: Look, let's go before we're caught and blamed.)
DOCTOR: I've seen wounds inflicted this way before.
ADRIC: Doctor, we have got to get out of here!
DOCTOR: Yes.
RINGWAY: On this ship we execute murderers.
Part Three
DOCTOR: Then make sure you kill the right people. Look at them.
RINGWAY: No tricks.
DOCTOR: Look at the state they're in.
BRIGGS: Turn that thing off.
BRIGGS: What's the delay? Where's Ringway?
BERGER: Bridge.
RINGWAY : I've apprehended two stowaways.
BRIGGS: Apprehended. Why can't he say caught? So melodramatic.
BERGER: Take them to the brig.
BRIGGS: I'd rather have them up here.
RINGWAY : Vance and Carson are dead. Murdered by the stowaways.
BRIGGS: Oh, that's all we need.
RINGWAY : Their bodies are by silo nine four one.
BRIGGS: Well, get a stretcher party down there. You've done well, Mister. You'll get an extra bonus.
RINGWAY: I'd rather have Vance and Carson alive.
CYBERMAN: Which one is the Doctor?
LEADER: The tall one with the fair hair. Even under the threat of death, he has the arrogance of a Time Lord.
CYBERMAN: Now the Doctor is a prisoner, it is time to secure the freighter.
LEADER: Indeed, but the Doctor must be taken alive. He must suffer for our past defeats.
SCOTT: I think I should go and look for him.
NYSSA: No, wait. You might spoil things.
TEGAN: The Doctor's quite capable. And Nyssa's right, a show of force might ruin everything.
SCOTT: I hope you're right.
RINGWAY: There's no hurry. They're quite dead, aren't they.
DOCTOR: Look
ADRIC: What do we have to say to convince you that we're not stowaways?
RINGWAY: There's nothing you can say.
DOCTOR: Let me show you how we travelled here. We have a ship of our own. We don't need to be stowaways.
RINGWAY: Stowaways or pirates, you're still murderers. Keep moving.
LEADER: Activate my personal guard.
CYBERMAN: Will that be enough, Leader?
LEADER: The crew is small. They will offer little resistance.
BRIGGS: You've caused me a great deal of trouble.
DOCTOR: I assure you, you have the wrong people.
RINGWAY: Don't answer the captain back.
BRIGGS: It's quite all right, Ringway. I can fight my own battles, thank you. I suppose you're going to say you know nothing about the disappearance of three of my crew members.
DOCTOR: How can we? We've only just arrived on your ship.
BRIGGS: Someone's responsible.
ADRIC: It isn't us.
BERGER: A power surge!
BRIGGS: Is this your work?
NYSSA: I don't understand this. There's a strong electromagnetic field nearby.
TEGAN: So what?
NYSSA: It's sheer size. It's massive!
TEGAN: Well, could it harm the Doctor and Adric?
NYSSA: I can't tell without knowing what's happening.
CYBERMAN: Receptors fully charged.
LEADER: Excellent. Activate.
CYBERMAN: Reaction reading steady.
LEADER: Continue.
BRIGGS: A bomb on Earth, controlled from this ship?
ADRIC: It's all true.
DOCTOR: Every word.
BERGER: At least his story is original.
BRIGGS: Are you trying to make a fool of me?
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't dare.
RINGWAY: He's just wasting time.
DOCTOR: You said yourself things have occurred you can't explain.
BRIGGS: It doesn't follow that I've got a band of conspirators at work on the ship.
DOCTOR: Well, the crewmen who disappeared may have discovered otherwise.
BERGER: Why are you listening to this fool? He'll say anything to wriggle his way out of it.
BRIGGS: What's that?
BERGER: It's happening again. A power surge.
SCOTT: We've waited long enough.
KYLE: The Lieutenant's right. The Doctor could be in a lot of trouble.
NYSSA: I'm as concerned as you, but my instinct is to wait.
KYLE: Why?
NYSSA: Things don't feel right.
TEGAN: The electromagnetic field.
NYSSA: Yes. I want things to settle down before we go out.
BRIGGS: The power loss is enormous.
DOCTOR: How often has this happened?
BERGER: A few times, but never on this scale. There's your power loss. Hold number four.
BRIGGS:  Well, get a squad down there at once.
DOCTOR: Can't you isolate the power line?
BERGER: Not without closing down half the ship. It's a main cable.
DOCTOR: Well, it's the only way you'll stop them.
BRIGGS: Who?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I have the feeling whatever's causing your power loss is out for considerable more than control of this ship.
CYBERMAN: Personal guard fully activated.
LEADER: Excellent.
CYBERMAN: The captain of the freighter will see that his power lines have been tapped.
LEADER: Why did you not jam their instruments?
CYBERMAN: Our demand on their electrical supply was too great. The ship's computer was alerted.
LEADER: We will take the bridge at once. Continue the reactivation.
BRIGGS: Ringway!
RINGWAY: Yes, Captain?
BRIGGS: Stand fast.
BERGER: We must come out of warp drive.
BRIGGS: No!
BERGER: If we continue to lose power at this rate, our engines could misphase.
BRIGGS: I will not risk losing my bonus for a few miserable stowaways.
DOCTOR: Your first officer is right. You must listen to her.
BRIGGS: No!
ADRIC: Why not?
BERGER: The transponder would inform Earth Security that we deviated from flight schedule. If Earth is on red alert, we would be stopped.
BRIGGS: We haven't got time. If I'm late delivering my cargo I not only lose my bonus, but I have to pay a heavy fine.
DOCTOR: The story about the bomb is true. Whoever planted it is now in your hold.
BRIGGS: I will not stop this ship.
DOCTOR: You've got clearance through to Earth. That's where they want to go. You're giving them safe passage!
BRIGGS: Position your men on the high walkway. What's down there, stays there.
RINGWAY: Yes, Captain.
ADRIC: Now look, you must listen to the Doctor.
BRIGGS: I've no reason to believe either of you two.
BERGER: Then believe your own instruments, Captain.
BRIGGS: We will go on.
NYSSA: The magnetic field is reducing. It should be safe to go out.
SCOTT: Right, we're moving out.
TEGAN: I want to come with you.
SCOTT: No. It could be rough.
TEGAN: I think I'd find it rougher waiting.
KYLE: Are you sure? You're not even dressed for it.
TEGAN: Are you going out?
KYLE: No.
TEGAN: Then lend me your overalls.
NYSSA: Don't bother to argue.
SCOTT: If the Doctor returns, call me.
SCOTT: I don't want to be out there any longer than I have to.
RINGWAY: Bring some more down here. Down here.
KYLE: Is there nothing positive we can do?
NYSSA: Try not to worry.
BERGER: Power loss has stabilised.
BRIGGS: Can we hold warp speed?
BERGER: Just about.
BRIGGS: I knew it. We'll make it yet.
ADRIC: Do you remember what you asked me after we deactivated the bomb?
DOCTOR: Why a bomb and not some other device.
ADRIC: Well, with the Earth on red alert, a missile wouldn't get through.
DOCTOR: Hmm. We still don't know what they're really after.
BERGER: Captain, look.
BRIGGS: This could be it.
RINGWAY : Ringway.
BRIGGS: Stand by. The security cameras are on the blink.
DOCTOR: Perhaps I could help?
BRIGGS: You stay where you are.
BERGER: We should secure these two in the brig.
BRIGGS: Not yet. I want them where I can see them.
RINGWAY: To your positions. Take cover.
BRIGGS: We've regained full power. Right, on your feet, you two.
DOCTOR: About time.
BRIGGS: Be quiet.
TEGAN: It's vast. We'll never find him.
SCOTT: You wanted to come.
TEGAN: I know. I'm just a mouth on legs.
RINGWAY : There's something on the move.
BRIGGS: I can't see anything yet.
BRIGGS: Are these your friends?
DOCTOR: Definitely not.
ADRIC: What are they?
DOCTOR: Cybermen.
BERGER: Are they robots?
DOCTOR: Far worse. You must withdraw your men, they don't stand a chance.
BRIGGS: Neither will we if those things get up here.
SCOTT: Could that be the Doctor?
TEGAN: I hope not. Guns are not his style at all.
SCOTT: All right, set weapons on kill. I'm not taking any chances. Slowly now.
BRIGGS: Our defences are crumbling. We must help.
BERGER: We can't leave these two.
BRIGGS: We'll take them with us.
RINGWAY: No, you won't. Stay where you are.
BRIGGS: Ringway!
RINGWAY: Yes, Captain?
BRIGGS: The enemy's outside, Mister. You're pointing your gun in the wrong direction.
RINGWAY: I'm relieving you of command.
BRIGGS: Oh, come off it.
RINGWAY: Shut up! I'm tired of your snide remarks and bullying ways.
DOCTOR: Oh, you haven't seen anything. Wait until the Cybermen start.
RINGWAY: You know them?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, we go back a long way.
DOCTOR: This slaughter is pointless.
RINGWAY: Your crew is redundant. The Cybermen will soon be in command.
BRIGGS: You traitor!
DOCTOR: It's the Cybermen's way.
BRIGGS: They must have paid you a lot for this.
DOCTOR: I bet it isn't in gold.
RINGWAY: Shut up!
DOCTOR: Cybermen are rather allergic to the stuff. Brings them out in a cold sweat.
ADRIC: Why?
DOCTOR: It clogs up their chest units. Suffocates them, doesn't it.
RINGWAY: Just keep talking, Doctor. When the time comes, killing you is going to be a joy.
BRIGGS: Where do these Cybermen come from?
DOCTOR: Originally Mondas, but that was destroyed. You know, I'm surprised they didn't mention me.
RINGWAY: Perhaps you overestimate your importance.
DOCTOR: Oh, I doubt it. Especially as I confined them to a frozen tomb on Telos. Didn't they mention that either? Oh well, they have been forgetful.
RINGWAY: What's that?
ADRIC: A badge.
RINGWAY: I can see it's a badge. What's it made of?
ADRIC: I don't know.
RINGWAY: It's gold.
ADRIC: What? Gold? Oh, only the edge. It couldn't do any harm.
RINGWAY: Trying to hide it from me, were you?
DOCTOR: Listen! The firing's stopped.
RINGWAY: Berger. Where's Berger?
DOCTOR: Look out!
DOCTOR: Berger!
DOCTOR: Those shields won't hold them there for long.
BRIGGS: They'll last until we get back to Earth.
DOCTOR: And then?
BRIGGS: There's only a few of them. Our security men will cope with them.
DOCTOR: They're an invasion force. Earth is where they want to go. There are considerably more than a few on board.
ADRIC: How many of these silos are you carrying?
BRIGGS: Oh, fifteen thousand.  No, it's not possible.
LEADER: Have you tested the defences?
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader. We are able to break through them.
LEADER: Excellent. Prepare to break through the bulkhead shields. Is the Doctor on the bridge?
CYBERMAN: He is.
LEADER: He must be taken alive.
TEGAN: I'm exhausted.
SCOTT: Shush. Keep your voice down.
SCOTT: He's dead.
TEGAN: It's a massacre.
SCOTT: The Doctor and Adric?
TEGAN: No. Look!
SCOTT: Take cover! Get back.
BRIGGS: We could pump all the air out of the hold.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Cybermen don't need it. Is there any way you could jettison the hold?
BRIGGS: None.
ADRIC: I think Mister Ringway's recovering.
BRIGGS: Pity. I've just composed a particularly nasty epitaph for him.
SCOTT: Whatever they are, they're going to be difficult to kill.
TEGAN: You haven't tried yet.
SCOTT: Look at those bodies. Same rifles as ours.
TEGAN: So?
SCOTT: Have you seen any of those silver things dead?
BRIGGS: Would threatening to kill him slow those tin things down?
DOCTOR: Not at all.
RINGWAY: You're all dead. Why don't you surrender?
DOCTOR: Not yet. There may be a way to neutralise that.
TEGAN: Do we go on?
SCOTT: Past them?
TEGAN: Is there another way?
LEADER: Ready?
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: Then activate the thermal lance.
ADRIC: Doctor!
DOCTOR: They've started. I see from the computer the ship is powered by antimatter.
BRIGGS: So?
DOCTOR: How is the antimatter contained?
BRIGGS: A stabilised vessel. Berger's the expert.
DOCTOR: Is there any way we could tap the stabilising device?
BERGER: Yes, the machinery's here.
DOCTOR: Excellent.
ADRIC: Are we going to stabilise the shield?
DOCTOR: Yes.
BRIGGS: Will it work?
BERGER: It might. It's worth a try.
KYLE: Shall we call them?
NYSSA: No.
NYSSA: I'm sure everything's all right.
ADRIC: Just explain what you're trying to do.
DOCTOR: We are under attack, Adric.
ADRIC: Well, tell me quickly.
DOCTOR: All right. First, tell me, what is the square root of three point six nine eight seven three?
ADRIC: Er, about one point nine two three two one.
BERGER: That's not possible.
DOCTOR: Oh, he's very good. And almost right.
ADRIC: Will you just try and explain what you're doing?
DOCTOR: Antimatter powers the ship. For the antimatter to remain safe, it has to be contained in a vessel with a totally stable molecular structure otherwise it would, well, blow to bits.
ADRIC: But no such material exists.
DOCTOR: Absolutely right. Although with computer-controlled electronics, it is possible to simulate it.
ADRIC: You're saying that that machine will constantly adjust and readjust the molecular structure of the antimatter vessel?
DOCTOR: Right. However destructive the antimatter is, the vessel is always stable.
ADRIC: That's very clever.
DOCTOR: Oh, it is.
BERGER: But will the device work to stabilise the shield?
DOCTOR: Well, if it doesn't, we're dead.
TEGAN: Can you cope with the two of them?
SCOTT: I hope so. We've got to get a clear shot at both of them.
BRIGGS: This shield's not going to last much longer.
BERGER: I'd better tell the computer what we're up to.
DOCTOR: Right. Hurry.
TEGAN: Now?
SCOTT: No. I want that second one just a bit closer. Fire!
SCOTT: Come back!
SCOTT: Don't take risks like that again!
TEGAN: One of them got away.
SCOTT: Yes. We should get back to the Tardis immediately.
TEGAN: Not before we've found the Doctor and Adric.
BERGER: Ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Right.
BRIGGS: Hurry, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Just a second.
LEADER: The shield is now soft enough. Break through.
ADRIC: It worked!
BRIGGS: Oh, well done, Doctor.
CYBERMAN: You are right, Leader. The Doctor is a formidable opponent.
LEADER: I anticipated as much. Activate the charge.
CYBERMAN: Leader!
CYBERMAN: He has been damaged by gunfire.
LEADER: There is still resistance.
CYBERMAN: According to the Earthling, there were only ten crew members. They have all been accounted for.
LEADER: Then he has lied. Order the activation of reinforcements.
LEADER: Charges primed?
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader.
LEADER: Fire!
DOCTOR: I should have realised.
BRIGGS: Oh no!
BRIGGS: Ow!
LEADER: So, we meet again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Er, no! Er
LEADER: He deceived us.
DOCTOR: You never change. Always the perfect guests.
KYLE: What happens to us if the Doctor doesn't come back?
NYSSA: It depends where this ship's going.
KYLE: You can't fly the Tardis?
NYSSA: I understand some of the principles.
KYLE: But you couldn't get us back to Earth?
NYSSA: Not without difficulty.
LEADER: Our records indicate that you have a fondness for Earth.
DOCTOR: Fondness? I'm surprised your emotionless brain understands the word.
LEADER: It is a word like any other. And so is destruction, which is what we are going to do to that planet.
DOCTOR: You've tried before.
LEADER: This time we shall succeed, and you will live just long enough to witness it.
CYBERMAN: Reactivation completed.
LEADER: Excellent. Now you will see our strength.
SCOTT: Take cover!
LEADER: My army awakes, Doctor!
Part Four
BRIGGS: This is piracy!
LEADER: It is war.
BERGER: The ship is in warp drive. Interfere with the navigational system and we will disintegrate.
LEADER: Your technology is primitive compared to ours. Mistakes will not be made.
KYLE: What was that?
NYSSA: I don't know. A robot.
KYLE: They're huge!
SCOTT: Oh, where's Tegan?
BRIGGS: What are they doing?
BERGER: I don't know. They've incorporated a machine of their own.
DOCTOR: I suspect the ship is now on a locked off fixed coordinate.
ADRIC: Are we still going to Earth?
DOCTOR: Yes.
BERGER: Well then, why lock off the coordinates?
DOCTOR: Because I think they're turning us into a flying bomb.
LEADER: Your Tardis has been found, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I didn't know it was lost.
BRIGGS: You're mad if you think Earth security will let you crash into the planet. They'd shoot the ship down.
LEADER: There will not be time. You have a security transponder with clearance for Earth.
ADRIC: Yes, but why do it? On impact this ship will destroy everything. The planet will be useless.
LEADER: There is a conference about to take place on Earth.
DOCTOR: The reason for the red alert.
LEADER: Yes. The heads of many powerful planets will be present.
DOCTOR: So you destroy a few presidents in a needlessly destructive way.
LEADER: It is more than that. The purpose of the conference is to sign a pact uniting their military forces in a war against the Cyber race.
DOCTOR: Of course. A war you couldn't possibly win.
LEADER: Their combined forces would be too great.
DOCTOR: Destroy the conference and you destroy the unity.
LEADER: It will be a great psychological victory. The strength and might of the Cyber race will be confirmed.
DOCTOR: So the freighter replaces the bomb.
LEADER: Yes, Doctor. In spite of your interference, we will still triumph.
SCOTT: Scott to Tardis. Come in, please.
NYSSA : This is Nyssa.
SCOTT: We're coming back to the Tardis. The hold is crawling with robots.
NYSSA : Any of you hurt?
SCOTT: No, but we've got separated from Tegan.
DOCTOR: If the freighter crashes into Earth with you on board, won't that make it rather difficult for you to carry out your task? I mean, you would be very crumpled.
LEADER: I shall not be on board, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You don't surprise me.
LEADER: My function was leader of the squad to eliminate those who survived the bomb.
BRIGGS: Now your transport has replaced the bomb.
LEADER: I shall join a secondary force to complete my task.
BRIGGS: Are they all so dedicated?
DOCTOR: Compared to some, this one is positively flippant.
SCOTT: Gently.
KYLE: They're safe!
NYSSA: And those two robots have gone.
SCOTT: Wait till it's near, then concentrate your fire!
SCOTT: Now!
SCOTT: There's another one!
KYLE: Nyssa, get back!
NYSSA: No!
SCOTT: It's no use. She's dead.
TEGAN: Doctor! Adric!
DOCTOR: Where did you come from?
TEGAN: That thing caught me.
ADRIC: Where's Nyssa?
TEGAN: She's safe. She's in the Tardis.
LEADER: Who is this woman?
DOCTOR: An Earthling. No one of consequence.
TEGAN: Thanks a lot.
DOCTOR: Be quiet.
LEADER: She's one of your crew.
DOCTOR: In a manner of speaking.
LEADER: I see that Time Lords have emotional feelings.
DOCTOR: Of sorts.
LEADER: Surely a great weakness in one so powerful?
DOCTOR: Emotions have their uses.
LEADER: They restrict and curtail the intellect and logic of the mind.
DOCTOR: They also enhance life! When did you last have the pleasure of smelling a flower, watching a sunset, eating a well-prepared meal?
LEADER: These things are irrelevant.
DOCTOR: For some people, small, beautiful events is what life is all about!
LEADER: You have affection for this woman?
DOCTOR: She's a friend.
LEADER: And you do not consider friendship a weakness?
DOCTOR: I do not.
LEADER: Kill her.
DOCTOR: No!
LEADER: Such a reaction is not a disadvantage?
DOCTOR: No.
LEADER: You are mistaken. I now have control over you, Doctor. All I need do is threaten the woman's death for you to obey me.
SCOTT: At least we have two of their weapons. Might make them easier to kill.
NYSSA: You're not going out again?
SCOTT: I haven't much choice.
NYSSA: The Doctor won't thank you for throwing away your life.
LEADER: I return your ship to you, Captain.
BRIGGS: Really?
LEADER: You will continue your journey to Earth. The ship will function normally.
BRIGGS: We're to stay on board?
LEADER: Yes. Although your presence isn't needed, of course. The control of your ship is now totally automatic.
DOCTOR: This isn't necessary. Let them go.
LEADER: And deny them the feeling of fear, the ultimate in emotional response?
DOCTOR: You've already proved your point quite adequately.
LEADER: A final demonstration might convince any doubters.
CYBERMAN: We have finished, Leader.
LEADER: Excellent. Instruct all regenerated Cybermen to evacuate the ship. You will return to Cybercontrol and inform main fleet of our intention.
CYBERMAN: At once.
SCOTT: They're leaving.
LEADER: You two will remain on the bridge. Should any of the crew attempt to interfere with navigational equipment, they are to be restrained.
BRIGGS: Why don't you kill us now?
LEADER: I want my guards to observe your reactions.
TEGAN: That's sadistic.
LEADER: No, scientific. If we are to fight Earthlings, it is better we understand their weaknesses. We leave for your Tardis. The Earth woman as well.
TEGAN: The name is Tegan!
DOCTOR: I want Adric, too.
LEADER: The boy stays here.
TEGAN: No!
DOCTOR: I need him to help me fly the Tardis.
LEADER: I know that it requires only one person to pilot the Tardis.
DOCTOR: I'm not going without him.
LEADER: The boy will stay here. If you do not cooperate, I shall have the Earth woman destroyed.
TEGAN: We can't leave without him!
ADRIC: Take Tegan with you. I'll find my own way. Please?
BRIGGS: The boy's right. There's a chance. Leave now.
ADRIC: Please, Doctor.
LEADER: There is no chance.
ADRIC: Just leave!
DOCTOR: Good luck, Adric.
ADRIC: Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good luck to you all.
ADRIC: Goodbye, Tegan. I'll see you soon.
BRIGGS: Nice to see where we're going.
BERGER: We know where we're going.
BRIGGS: Nice to see when we arrive.
CYBERMAN: The freighter has been evacuated.
LEADER : Excellent.
CYBERMAN: And a ship is being dispatched from the main fleet to collect you.
LEADER : The fleet is too far away. I will use the Doctor's Tardis to observe the impact.
CYBERMAN: Leader.
LEADER : You will meet me there.
TEGAN: You won't like Earth.
LEADER: Like or dislike does not come into my consideration.
TEGAN: It will when you start going rusty.
SCOTT : This is Scott.
NYSSA: What's happening out there?
SCOTT : I don't know. Those robot things seem to have left the ship.
NYSSA: Is there any sign of the Doctor?
SCOTT : No, not yet.
NYSSA: Be careful. That magnetic field is functioning again.
ADRIC: How much time have we got?
BERGER: Not long. The ship is on maximum drive.
ADRIC: Could we undo what the Cybermen have done?
BRIGGS: Given time, I'm sure.
ADRIC: Well, even if we could just divert the ship a degree or two, at least we'd miss Earth.
BRIGGS: We'd have to cope with those things first.
CYBERMAN: Leader, the main fleet has acknowledged your intentions.
LEADER: Do they agree?
CYBERMAN: Yes, Leader. As soon as the freighter impacts, a small force will follow through and under your instructions subdue survivors.
LEADER: Excellent.
SCOTT: Marshall, you stay there and cover us. Brooks, come with me.
NYSSA: Doctor! Where's Adric?
DOCTOR: He's safe.
TEGAN: For the time being.
SCOTT: Lieutenant Scott, Captain.
LEADER: Have you locked on to the freighter's coordinates?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEADER: You will follow the freighter to Earth. I wish to witness the planet's final destruction.
TEGAN: You'll ruin your own plan doing that. The radar on Earth will pick up the Tardis.
LEADER: It is too small. Its image will be swamped by that of the freighter.
CYBERMAN: Everything has been considered.
LEADER: Search this ship.
BERGER: There's an override on the navigational control. My instructions are instantly countermanded.
BRIGGS: It's this thing that's causing it.
SCOTT: Can't you disconnect it?
BRIGGS: It's probably booby-trapped.
ADRIC: Maybe so, but it can be disconnected.
BRIGGS: How?
ADRIC: Solve the three logic codes.
BERGER: That could take forever.
ADRIC: Well, then I suggest we start at once.
SCOTT: It seems we have very little time, Captain.
LEADER: The time draws near.
DOCTOR: It isn't necessary to taunt her.
LEADER: It is simply a fact, Doctor.
TEGAN: Can't you do something?
DOCTOR: Not at the moment.
LEADER: Do not mislead the Earthling. This time we will not fail.
BERGER: Is that right?
ADRIC: It has to be. It's the only logical answer.
TEGAN: I don't have to watch this.
NYSSA: She doesn't have to be here.
DOCTOR: Gently, Tegan.
TEGAN: Gently? This is my planet they're about to destroy!
DOCTOR: No! You do things like that, we'll all finish up dead!
ADRIC: That's it! The first one's solved.
BRIGGS: We're running out of time. The troopers can't hold the Cybermen much longer.
BERGER: We're working as hard as we can. It's very complex.
ADRIC: It worked! See if it's released anything.
SCOTT: The power in these things is running out.
BERGER: Stand by.
NYSSA: What's happening?
TEGAN: Where have they gone?
DOCTOR: The freighter's jumped time warps.
LEADER: You will follow.
DOCTOR: Where?
LEADER: Follow them!
BERGER: We're travelling backwards in time.
BRIGGS: That's not possible!
ADRIC: It is when you have an alien machine overriding your computer.
LEADER: You will board the freighter.
DOCTOR: I can't.
LEADER: You will do as I say.
DOCTOR: It's physically impossible. The freighter is no longer on a fixed course. The coordinates are constantly changing. That's why it keeps fading. I've got nothing to lock on to.
SCOTT:  Rest there a minute. That was some bump.
BRIGGS: It's bigger than you think.
ADRIC: Well, if we can crack the remaining two logic circuits, we may be able to do something about it.
TEGAN: At least the Earth is safe now.
NYSSA: Doctor?
TEGAN: Don't tell me it isn't.
DOCTOR: Although the freighter is spiraling backwards in time, it's still locked on to the same spatial coordinates.
TEGAN: Earth?
LEADER: This is excellent news, Doctor. Earth will be destroyed. It will never exist as you have known it.
TEGAN: Is that true?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: That's it, the second logic code!
BRIGGS: We've come out of warp drive!
DOCTOR: Earth.
LEADER: Excellent. Hold this position. We shall observe from here.
TEGAN: No!
BRIGGS: Come on. We've done all we can do.
ADRIC: This is your planet!
BRIGGS: I know. And I realise the consequences of this freighter crashing into it.
ADRIC: There is still time to crack this last logic code.
BRIGGS: There isn't. Come on. It's only a few minutes before we enter Earth's gravitational pull.
SCOTT: You've done all you can, Adric.
ADRIC: I can crack this code!
BRIGGS: Come on, Lieutenant. And you, Berger.
BERGER: Adric!
ADRIC: You board.
BRIGGS: Come on, lad.
SCOTT: And that is an order, Adric.
ADRIC: Of course! That's it!
NYSSA: An escape pod!
LEADER: My guards evacuating the ship.
DOCTOR: It may be of some small consequence to know we've travelled backwards in time some sixty five million years.
TEGAN: Big deal.
DOCTOR: Think about it.
NYSSA: Do you recall the fossil dinosaur bones in the cave on Earth?
TEGAN: What?
NYSSA: And why it's believed they died out so quickly?
TEGAN: Earth collided with a meteorite.
NYSSA: Or something.
TEGAN: The freighter?
DOCTOR: The antimatter vessel will split open on impact. There will be a tremendous explosion.
TEGAN: The freighter was the meteorite?
DOCTOR: It seems inevitable, as is your history as we know it.
LEADER: You lie, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all. You've lost. The Earth is safe.
ADRIC: I can do it. I must do it.
SCOTT : Scott to Tardis. Scott to Tardis. Come in, please.
NYSSA: This is the Tardis. We have Cybermen on board.
SCOTT : We've managed to escape from the freighter, but Adric's still on board.
SCOTT : Scott to Tardis.
DOCTOR: You've failed, Leader.
LEADER: But you will not enjoy the victory. I shall now kill you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Get down!
ADRIC: There's something missing. There's something I've forgotten.
NYSSA: Please hurry, Doctor. We must get Adric off the freighter.
DOCTOR: The console's damaged.
NYSSA: We must save Adric! There's so little time!
ADRIC: Of course, that's it.
ADRIC: Now I'll never know if I was right.
NYSSA: Look out!
DOCTOR: I must save Adric!
TEGAN: Look!
NYSSA: Adric!
The freighter plummets through the Earth's atmosphere, and goes KaBOOM! The Doctor turns the scanner off.)
TEGAN: Adric? Doctor! Oh, no.
