The Robots of Death
Part One
V32: Turbulence centre, vector seven. Scan commencing now.
CHUB: There was a Voc therapist in Kaldor City, specially programmed, equipped with vibro-digits, subcutaneous stimulators, the lot. You know what happened, Borg?
CHUB: Its first client wanted treatment for a stiff elbow. The Voc therapist felt carefully all round the joint and then suddenly just twisted his arm off at the shoulder. Shumf! All over in two seconds.
BORG: I've never heard that. 
 
CHUB: Kaldor City.
DASK: What was the reason?
CHUB: Reason? It was haywire. I wouldn't let a robot work on me, not for the zelanite in this ship.
BORG: Shut up, Chub. Thank you, V16.
DASK: A Voc class robot has over a million multi-level constrainers in its circuitry. All of them would have to malfunction before it could perform such an action.
TOOS: That's your trouble, Dask. You take all the magic out of life.
CHUB: They go wrong, my friend. It's been known.
DASK: Only when there's an error in programming. Each case on record
CHUB: This was a case. Tore his arm off.
POUL: We're turning. Has anyone noticed?
ZILDA: I heard it was a leg.
V9: Mate in eight moves, Commander.
UVANOV: Never!
V9: I will check, Commander. The computation is confirmed.
UVANOV: Damn!
DASK: They're unbeatable, Commander.
UVANOV: Commander.
V14 : V14 tracer, sir.
UVANOV: Yes?
V14: Storm scale three, range ten point five two, timed three zero six, vector seven one and holding.
UVANOV : Right, full crew alert, 14. Out.
V14: Full crew alert. Full crew alert.
UVANOV: Chub, break out an instrument pack.
CHUB: Right, sir.
BORG: Let's hope this one's worth chasing.
TOOS: Time we had some luck.
V14 : Full crew alert.
LEELA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
LEELA: Can I stop now?
DOCTOR: If you want to.
LEELA: It will not affect this?
DOCTOR: Affect this? No, it's a yo-yo. It's a game. I thought you were enjoying it.
LEELA: Enjoying it? You said I had to keep it going up and down. I thought it was part of the magic.
DOCTOR: Magic, Leela? Magic?
LEELA: I know, I know. There's no such thing as magic.
DOCTOR: Exactly. To the rational mind nothing is inexplicable, only unexplained.
LEELA: So, explain to me how this Tardis is larger on the inside than the out.
DOCTOR: Hmm? All right, I'll show you. It's because insides and outsides are not in the same dimension.
DOCTOR: Which box is larger?
LEELA: That one.
DOCTOR: Now which one is larger?
LEELA: That one.
DOCTOR: But it looks smaller.
LEELA: Well, that's because it's further away.
DOCTOR: Exactly. If you could keep that exactly that distance away and have it here, the large one would fit inside the small one.
LEELA: That's silly.
DOCTOR: That's transdimensional engineering, a key Time Lord discovery.
DOCTOR: This is the exciting bit.
LEELA: What's exciting?
DOCTOR: Seeing what's outside.
DOCTOR: I don't. It's metal. We've landed inside something metal.
LEELA: But how can we? How can the Tardis be inside something metal?
DOCTOR: One box inside another. I just explained it to you.
LEELA: No, not very clearly.
DOCTOR: Well, it's a rather dull subject anyway. I wonder where we are?
LEELA: You mean you don't know?
DOCTOR: Well, not precisely, no.
LEELA: You mean you can't control this machine?
DOCTOR: Well, of course I can control it. Nine times out of ten. Well, seven times out of ten. Five times. Look. Never mind, let's see where you are.
DOCTOR: You won't need that.
LEELA: How do you know?
DOCTOR: I never carry weapons. If people see you mean them no harm, they never hurt you. Nine times out of ten.
UVANOV: How does it look, Toos?
TOOS: In a moment.
UVANOV: Right tracking?
ZILDA: Clear and running, Commander.
UVANOV: Left tracking?
ZILDA: And running.
TOOS: It's small. Scale three point four, not building.
UVANOV: What have you done with all the big ones?
ZILDA: Range four point one two. Running time three point three zero.
TOOS: That's something, anyway. We won't have to chase this one.
ZILDA: Ground centre zero zero one.
V32: No instrument pack report yet, sir.
UVANOV: Chub. Get after him.
POUL: It's all right, I'll go.
UVANOV: Scientists. How can I run a mine with amateurs.
ZILDA: Chub's all right.
UVANOV: Why? Because he's from one of the founding families?
ZILDA: I didn't mention his family.
UVANOV: One of the Twenty? You know, it's amazing the way you people stick together. No, it's not amazing, it's sickening.
ZILDA: I hope you're watching the traverses, Commander.
UVANOV: Please, don't worry about my job, Zilda. What's she blowing, Toos?
TOOS: The spectrum is muddy. Could be some zelanite, some keefan, traces of lucanol!
UVANOV: Ah, money in the bank. Cheer up, Zilda. I'll make you rich again.
CHUB: Oh. Where in the seven suns is that robot? Robot? Robot?
V45: Yes, sir?
CHUB: Where have you been? Get that instrument package. Well, come on, get a move on. I've got to launch it before the hatches are locked.
CHUB: Did you hear what I said?
V45: Yes, sir. I heard what you said.
CHUB: Well, get on with it, then. No, look, there, you electronic moron. What are you doing? Look, stop. Stand still. Oh no.
CHUB: No. Get back. Get away from me!
UVANOV: This is the Commander. All checks complete. All systems clear and running. Security robots stand by to commence main hatch-lock sequence now.
TOOS: Range two ten. Running time point four three.
UVANOV: Duty mover, stand by for switch to motive power. Coming right down our throats so we can really suck the pay stream out of this one.
V32: Monitors indicate obstruction on forward scoop deck.
UVANOV: Then get it cleared, V32. Get it cleared.
LEELA: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's basically hardened alloy. Scored all over. It must come in under great pressure.
LEELA: What must?
DOCTOR: Whatever it is they fill it up with.
LEELA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: This is very interesting.
LEELA: Back there. I heard something.
DOCTOR: It comes in here.
LEELA: What does?
DOCTOR: Whatever it is.
TOOS: Range point eight seven. Running time point one three. Ground centre zero nine three.
UVANOV: It's veering away. Mover, where's that power?
BORG : It's coming, sir.
UVANOV: So is old age, Borg, and I don't want to spend mine in this desert waiting for you to do your job.
TOOS: Range point three. Running time point zero two. Ground centre nine nine one.
BORG : Switching to motive units now.
UVANOV: We may just catch the edge, but we're going to have to chase to stay there.
POUL: Commander.
UVANOV: What is it?
POUL: Chub's dead.
ZILDA: Dead!
UVANOV: You sure?
POUL: Of course I'm sure.
UVANOV: All right then, first things first. There's nothing we can do for him now.
POUL: He was murdered!
UVANOV: How do you know?
POUL: Because people don't strangle themselves.
TOOS: Strangled?
POUL: Yes. He's in the forward storage locker.
ZILDA: You have to abort this one.
UVANOV: What, and lose this storm? We're almost on to it.
ZILDA: Poul's talking about murder, Commander.
UVANOV: I'm talking about money!
POUL: You have no choice!
ZILDA: This time.
UVANOV: Close scoops, trim vents. Crew, stand down.
LEELA: What is it?
DOCTOR: Desert. Either that or the tide's gone out.
LEELA: Where are the trees?
DOCTOR: There's no water, so nothing grows. Nothing at all, by the look of it.
LEELA: It's beautiful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A bit garish for my taste.
LEELA: What's that white thing on the horizon?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Looks like dust. It's a sandstorm. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on! This is a sandminer. We're in one of the scoops.
LEELA: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: The storm could be travelling at a thousand miles an hour. The sand will cut us to pieces unless we get back to the Tardis. Come on!
DOCTOR: We've been robbed!
LEELA: I said I heard something.
DOCTOR: The shutters!
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: If there are no manual controls, we're dead!
LEELA: Somebody must have heard.
UVANOV: Was he like this when you found him?
POUL: Just a little fresher.
UVANOV: You said you heard screams.
POUL: Yes.
UVANOV: He was strangled.
POUL: The scream stopped.
UVANOV: What's this?
POUL: I've no idea.
UVANOV: Crew all assembled?
POUL: They should be by now.
UVANOV: Let's get this thing settled then. The sooner we get this worked out, the sooner we get back to making our quota. Scientists. I never should have let him on board.
POUL: He'd probably agree with you.
UVANOV: Poul!
POUL: Coming, Commander.
DOCTOR: There must be a way out.
LEELA: I do not think I like this metal world, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, we can't get out of it until we find the Tardis.
LEELA: Watch it!
UVANOV: All present?
DASK: Kerril's not here yet.
TOOS: He's on his way. He's in the rear section. But it'll take a while.
UVANOV: Right, we'll make a start, then.
DASK: Right.
UVANOV: Now, you all know that Chub is dead. One of you killed him.
ZILDA: One of us, surely.
UVANOV: That's what I said.
POUL: You did say one of you.
UVANOV: All right then, one of us killed him. The question is, which one?
TOOS: And why?
UVANOV: Well, this is a two year tour. Maybe Chub was just beginning to get on somebody's nerves.
BORG: Me?
ZILDA: He was certainly getting on yours.
UVANOV: Yes, but we all know where I was.
BORG: I was on the power deck.
UVANOV: Was Dask with you?
BORG: Yes.
DASK: Not all the time. I went to check the syncro-relays.
BORG: Now look, I had nothing against Chub. Okay, he talked too much but
ZILDA: Anyway, the time Poul heard the scream.
CASS: Ah, ah, says he heard the scream. Let's keep the point open.
POUL: Why should I lie?
UVANOV: Now you interrupted Zilda. Founding Family people never interrupt each other. Isn't that right, Zilda?
POUL: Someone interrupted Chub with both hands.
UVANOV: Please, Poul. We're all waiting for Zilda.
ZILDA: I was simply going to say the scream could have been arranged.
TOOS: How?
ZILDA: A communicator recording.
UVANOV: What would be the point?
ZILDA: To give somebody an alibi, Commander. You sent Poul to look for Chub. You could have arranged it all.
TOOS: You mean the poor man might have been dead when Poul heard the scream?
UVANOV: Nice try, Zilda. Now, does anybody know what this is?
DASK: It's a corpse marker.
UVANOV: What?
DASK: Robot deactivation disc. They use them in the construction centres. If ever we used the stop circuit and turned off all our robots, they'd have to go back to a construction centre for reactivation. On arrival, each would be marked with a disc like that to show it was a deactivated robot. The technicians call them corpse markers. It's a sort of a joke.
POUL: It seems our murderer has a sense of humour.
UVANOV: That was on the back of Chub's hand.
BORG: Not just a murderer, then. Seems like one one of us is a maniac.
CASS: Use your brain, Borg. We would know, wouldn't we?
BORG: But we don't.
BORG: Do we.
V14: Storm scale sixteen, range nine point eight. Time, two zero one. Vector seven two and holding.
V32: All right, 14. Full crew alert. All but the human in the rear section are accounted for. Storm mine four is now under complete robot control. Begin the check sequence.
LEELA: Doctor, how do you know they're not hostile?
DOCTOR: Because robots are programmed to help people, not hurt them. You won't hurt us, will you?
V9: Please wait here.
LEELA: What's all this for?
DOCTOR: Mineral extraction. The surface of this planet is a sea of sand
DOCTOR : Probably several miles deep and constantly moving. And I imagine contains valuable metallic elements, otherwise they wouldn't go to all this trouble.
LEELA: But those creepy mechanical men
DOCTOR: Yes. I have seen a similar sort of thing on Korlano Beta. The mine passes over the surface searching for useful ores. Naturally, the heavier elements tend to sink into the substratas, so a really good sandstorm is a bonus. It stirs things up a bit.
LEELA: Sometimes you talk like a Tesh.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
LEELA: It was not well meant. Are the mechanical men friendly?
DOCTOR: Robots don't have feelings. It's the people they serve we must hope are friendly.
LEELA: Perhaps there are no people here.
DOCTOR: What? Robots don't need chairs, and certainly not padded ones.
LEELA: Because they have no feelings?
SV7: Please identify yourselves.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor, and that's Leela. I wonder if it's possible for us to speak to the person in charge? I'd like to thank him for saving our lives.
SV7: I command.
DOCTOR: Well, thank you for saving our lives.
SV7: What are you doing here?
LEELA: Oh, well, the other mechanical man told us to wait.
SV7: What were you doing in the scoop?
DOCTOR: Trying to get out.
SV7: Please wait here.
LEELA: Talkative. No, Doctor. He said we must wait here.
DOCTOR: First we find the Tardis, then we have a little scout round, and we'll be back before they know.
LEELA: Doctor.
UVANOV: Right. Hold them there. Well, that settles that, then.
CASS: I told you. Didn't I say so? Mania.
UVANOV: Come on, let's all get back to work.
POUL: Now just a minute.
ZILDA: Yes. What do you mean, let's get back to work?
UVANOV: You heard SV7. There are intruders, a man and a woman. They're obviously the murderers and we've got them under lock and key.
BORG: Why are they obviously the murderers? I don't see that.
CASS: You just don't like to be wrong, do you.
BORG: Nobody's proved that I am. I mean, who are these people?
ZILDA: Could they be ore raiders?
BORG: Ore raiders? There's no such thing.
UVANOV: No, listen. We are at the moment in the middle of the biggest storm we've come across since we started this tour and we are wasting time.
BORG: The robots are mining.
UVANOV: The robots do not have instincts. They'd be lucky to get half of what we can get. We are not out in the middle of this desert for pleasure. We are here to make money. So get on your feet and get back to work. That is an order!
BORG: Give it to a robot.
UVANOV: What did you say?
TOOS: Commander, we've got to find out about those two.
POUL: For all we know, there may be more of them.
CASS: Makes sense.
DASK: If there are more of them, they will be caught. In the meantime, as the Commander suggests, I think we should return to our posts.
ZILDA: Why? Nothing's changed.
UVANOV: All right.  Seven.
SV7 : Yes, Commander.
UVANOV: Bring the man and the woman here.
SV7 : I was about to inform you, Commander. They have escaped.
BORG: You see?
UVANOV: What? Escaped? Then you'd better find them and find them quick. Put every spare robot on it.
DOCTOR: Hello, my dear old thing.
DOCTOR: The ore comes in under pressure from the separators. I wonder what it is, Leela. What do you think. Leela? Leela? I wish that girl wouldn't wander off like that.
Part Two
UVANOV: Where do you think you are going?
CASS: To search. We've got to find those killers.
UVANOV: The robots can handle it.
CASS: So can I.
UVANOV: Where do you think you're going?
BORG: He's right, Commander.
UVANOV: You stay where you are.
TOOS: Maybe it would be quicker if we all went to look.
UVANOV: We are not armed. There are two killers loose aboard the ship, maybe more.
DASK: The robots can handle the situation more efficiently than we can.
TOOS: All right. I just thought you were in a hurry to get back to work.
UVANOV: I am not in any hurry to get myself killed, Toos.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Thank you very much.
SV7: What were you doing in the hopper?
DOCTOR: Oh, don't ask me such silly questions. How did you know I was in there?
SV7: When I got here, the gauge showed a high percentage of impurity in the ore. I therefore checked.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not surprised. There's a dead man in there. Murdered. Strangled. Look.
SV7: That is Kerril.
DOCTOR: Oh.
SV7: Nearest Voc, subpriority red four, section five two. V17.
SV7: Commander Uvanov has ordered that you be restrained for questioning. Please do not try to escape again.
DOCTOR: Is the robot command circuit routed only through you?
SV7: I am the coordinator. Restrain this person.
DOCTOR: Easy now. Don't get excited.
LEELA: Doctor!
LEELA: Doctor, you were right. There was a body. Two of the robots, they took it to a special place.
D84: Please do not cry out. It is important that I am not found here.
LEELA: Obviously.
D84: If I had killed him, would I not have killed you too?
LEELA: You still haven't explained what you're doing here.
D84: You have not explained what you were doing here.
LEELA: Oh, well I was looking for the Doc. I don't have to explain anything to you. You're just a mechanical man. You're not real.
D84: Do you know what this is?
LEELA: No.
D84: I must ask. I must ask that you tell no one about me.
LEELA: Is there anyone left alive to tell?
UVANOV: Oh, so we've caught one.
UVANOV: But not soon enough, though.
LEELA: I didn't kill him. Ask this thing.
UVANOV: You'll have to do better than that. Who are you?
LEELA: Leela. Who are you?
UVANOV: Why did you kill him?
LEELA: You try that again and I'll cripple you.
UVANOV: Why did you kill him?
LEELA: I didn't! Tell him.
UVANOV: That is a single function labour robot, D class. D for dumb. It can't speak.
LEELA: Has anyone told him that?
UVANOV: You have cost me and company a great deal of money and you have killed three people. Can you think of any good reason why I should not have you executed on the spot?
LEELA: No, but you can, otherwise you'd have done it.
UVANOV: Now don't get clever with me.
POUL: We've caught the man, too. Seems he killed Kerril. Poor Cass. You must be stronger than you look.
LEELA: You must be stupider than you look if you think I did that.
UVANOV: Where is this man?
POUL: They're taking him to the crew room now.
UVANOV: Well, come on, then.
POUL: Why do you use these? Robot deactivation discs. There was one on Kerril, too.
UVANOV: You fool! What did you have to tell her that for?
POUL: I assumed she knew.
UVANOV: If we could have got her to tell us what those corpse markers were, we'd be halfway to a confession.
POUL: Halfway to two confessions. Dask knew what they were.
UVANOV: Which rather rules him out. He would hardly have admitted it if he was responsible.
POUL: Have you never heard of the double bluff?
UVANOV: You seem very keen to spread suspicion, Poul. Could it be that you have got something to hide?
POUL: We've all got something to hide. Don't you think so, Commander?
UVANOV: Bring that!
LEELA: I didn't kill him. I didn't kill him!
POUL: No. Pity, but no.
DOCTOR: Would you like a jelly baby?
BORG: Shut up!
DOCTOR: A simple no thank you would have been sufficient.
POUL: Return to your normal duty.
LEELA: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: I'm fine.
UVANOV: Cass is dead.
LEELA: That one's ready to kill. I had to restrain him.
DOCTOR: Shush. It's because they're frightened. That's why they're dangerous.
BORG: She murdered him, didn't she.
POUL: How do you know he was murdered?
BORG: It's obvious.
ZILDA: You marked Cass for death.
BORG: What are you talking about?
POUL: You did put a corpse marker on him.
BORG: Well, yes, but I didn't mean anything by it.
DASK: Was Cass the same as the others?
UVANOV: Yes, exactly the same. And who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I assume you're in command here.
UVANOV: Yes. What are you doing here?
DOCTOR: Just standing here talking to you.
UVANOV: I should be very careful if I were you.
DOCTOR: No doubt you would.
UVANOV: What are you doing on this mine?
DOCTOR: Well, we're travellers. We came here by accident.
UVANOV: Oh, I see. A hundred million miles of uncharted desert and you just stumbled across us?
DOCTOR: Well, it's a small world.
UVANOV: Yes. I suppose it's also a coincidence that as soon as you two arrive, three of our people are killed? Well?
DOCTOR: Oh sorry, I thought it was a rhetorical question. Yes, it's just a coincidence.
BORG: Why are we wasting time on them? We know they're guilty.
ZILDA: We don't know anything of the sort.
POUL: We just hope they're guilty.
BORG: He was hiding Kerril's body in that hopper and got trapped when it was turned on. Now that's a fact.
DOCTOR: No, that's an inference. I wasn't hiding that body, I was finding it, and I'd say it was put there for precisely that reason. Someone wanted to kill me, too.
ZILDA: The murderer?
POUL: No. The others were strangled. Why should he be any different?
DOCTOR: To put suspicion onto me.
POUL: Why bother? You're a stowaway. What could be more suspicious than a stowaway?
DOCTOR: A dead stowaway.
ZILDA: It's possible, you know. He could be telling the truth.
TOOS: As a lie, it's pretty feeble.
UVANOV: Ever hear of the double bluff?
DOCTOR: Well, yes, now you come to mention it, I do remember once
UVANOV: Lock them up in the storage bank. Put a guard on them.
BORG: I agree with the Commander.
ZILDA: Well it gets you out of an awkward situation, doesn't it?
BORG: Why don't you shut your mouth.
TOOS: Why don't you shut yours.
BORG: What? She's as good as accusing me of murdering my friends.
ZILDA: You never had any friends.
UVANOV: Have you quite finished? Look, either one of us murdered them or they did. Which do you think is the more likely?
DOCTOR: Er, ahem. There is one other possibility you seem to have overlooked.
BORG: We've heard quite enough out of you.
DOCTOR: You know, you're a classic example of the inverse ratio between the size of the mouth and the size of the brain.
BORG: Stinking murderer!
POUL: Stop her!
DASK: Come on, Borg. It doesn't matter.
UVANOV: V8, lock up these two strangers.
POUL: I still don't like it.
UVANOV: Nobody is asking you to like it, just do it.
TOOS: All right, Commander.
UVANOV: There are fewer of us now. We'll each get a larger share, if that's any consolation.
ZILDA: No, Commander, that isn't any consolation.
UVANOV: Tell me, Zilda. Why do you hate me?
ZILDA: You flatter yourself.
UVANOV: Well, let me tell you something. By the time this trip is over, I'll have more money than you or your fancy family ever dreamed of.
ZILDA: May I go now, Commander?
MAN: Zilda.
ROBOT: I will kill Zilda.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
LEELA: Nice of them to leave our arms free.
DOCTOR: Yes, I just want to scratch.
LEELA: These metal straps, they won't budge.
DOCTOR: Of course not.
LEELA: The robots bent them as though they were leather.
DOCTOR: Yes, then locked the molecular structure. The result's bands as solid as cast iron.
LEELA: Oh, hopeless.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't say that.
LEELA: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Concentrating. Whatever's locked can always be unlocked. It's just a matter of thinking out the right combination.
LEELA: How long will that take?
DOCTOR: No more than two or three weeks.
LEELA: Three weeks!
DOCTOR: Well, there are several million combinations to think through.
LEELA: You don't seem to be taking this very seriously, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm taking it very, very seriously. I have an uncomfortable feeling that if the murderer doesn't kill us, the Commander will. That is, assuming they're not one and the same person.
DASK: V21, check those figures.
TOOS: We're nearly fifty percent under target.
DASK: The first third of the operation.
ZILDA: Well, you should tell the Commander.
UVANOV: Tell the Commander what?
TOOS: That unless we find a rich vein we'll take the miner back half empty. Barely cover the operating costs.
UVANOV: Don't worry, Toos. I've never gone back to base with an empty tank yet.
TOOS: This trip could be different.
ZILDA: It's certainly been different so far. I'm taking my rest period.
UVANOV: Oh, are you?
ZILDA: If you don't mind, Commander.
UVANOV: I think I'm going to change the duty schedule. She's been on deck one hour and she needs a rest!
DASK: Rest time is an entitlement, Commander.
UVANOV: Yes, but this mine is already undermanned. I don't know how we're ever going to make our quota.
V16: Lucanol stream bearing two four.
UVANOV: Yes, I see it, 16.
TOOS: Stream bearing left.
UVANOV: It's all right. Relax, Toos, relax.
V16: Ground centre bearing seven two zero.
TOOS: We're losing it.
UVANOV: Right centre four degrees, V16, and for your information, Toos, I've never lost an ore stream yet. Right centre two degrees.
LEELA: Someone's coming.
POUL: I'd like to help you.
DOCTOR: You could undo these clamps.
POUL: You said there was a possibility that we had overlooked. What is it?
LEELA: Be careful of him, Doctor. He's not what he seems.
POUL: Why do you say that?
LEELA: Well, you move like a hunter. Watch all the time.
DOCTOR: Are you a hunter, Poul?
POUL: Never mind about me. What matters to you is Commander Uvanov. I know him, and I know it's only a matter of time before he decides that it's a waste of food, water and labour keeping you alive.
DOCTOR: That concerns you?
POUL: I don't think you did it. I know she couldn't have strangled Cass, not without knocking him out first, and there's no sign of that. So tell me what you know and I'll try to help you.
DOCTOR: Well .
DOCTOR: Thank you. One of your robots could have done it.
POUL:  That's your great theory, is it? Well, my friend, robots cannot kill. Their prime directive
DOCTOR: I know, I know, I know. It's the first programme that's laid into any robot's brain from the simplest Dumb to the most complex Super Voc. But suppose, suppose someone's found a way of bypassing it.
POUL: It's impossible. It's just impossible!
DOCTOR: Bumble-bees.
POUL: What?
DOCTOR: Terran insects. Aerodynamically impossible for them to fly, but they do it. I'm rather fond of bumble-bees. Come on. There's something I want to look at.
LEELA: Ahem.
LEELA: Thank you.
POUL: The first murder happened here.
DOCTOR: Tell us about it. What was his name?
POUL: His name was Chub, a government meteorologist. I don't know much about him, he wasn't part of the team, just along to study the storms.
DOCTOR: Who found him?
POUL: I did. I heard him scream. I came looking. It was odd, that, because he was strangled like the others.
DOCTOR: So whoever killed him was strong. Too strong for him to resist.
LEELA: He could have been taken by surprise.
POUL: He had time to scream.
DOCTOR: What do you think he was doing here?
POUL: Oh, we were on a run up to a storm. He came to get an instrument package to send up in one of his weather balloons.
DOCTOR: Where was he found?
POUL: He was lying there.
DOCTOR: Is that one of his packages?
POUL: I think so. Yes, yes it is.
DOCTOR: Good. Imagine you're Chub. There's a storm coming up. Pass me one of those packages.
POUL: It seems to be stuck. It must be jammed at the back.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. In those circumstances you're in a hurry. What would you do?
POUL: Well, I'd call. I'd call for a robot.
ZILDA: No.
ZILDA : You did it, Uvanov.
UVANOV: Zilda, is that you?
ZILDA : You thought you'd get away with it, didn't you.
UVANOV: What are you doing in my quarters?
ZILDA : You filthy murderer!
UVANOV: Toos, take over.
ZILDA : You filthy, disgusting man and animal.
TOOS: Uvanov's on his way down. What's wrong, Zilda?
ZILDA : Ah!
TOOS: Zilda?
DASK: The killings. They've affected her mind.
TOOS: No, she's found something out.
POUL: Wait here. I'm going to get the others. If you're right about this, you can't imagine what it'll mean.
DOCTOR: What do you mean, I can't imagine what it'll mean? This isn't the only robot dependent civilisation in the galaxy, you know.
POUL: Poul here.
TOOS [OC}: Go to Uvanov's quarters as fast as you can. Zilda came on the command speaker and accused him of being the killer. He's left Control like a scale twenty blow.
POUL: I'm on my way.  No, you wait here.
DOCTOR: Sit down. Sit down. What did you call those robots?
LEELA: Creepy mechanical men.
DOCTOR: Yes. You know, people never really lose that feeling of unease with robots. The more of them there are, the greater the unease and of course the greater the dependence. It's a vicious circle. People can neither live with them nor exist without them.
LEELA: So what happens if the strangler is a robot?
DOCTOR: Oh, I should think it's the end of this civilisation.
POUL: Uvanov!
UVANOV: Just like the others.
POUL: Yes, just like the others. SV7 to the Commander's quarters.
UVANOV: She really hated me, you know. I did think maybe when this trip was over and I was really rich. I must be getting soft. Now look, there's more than those two aboard. Get the tin brains to make another search and this time do it thoroughly.
POUL: No, Uvanov.
UVANOV: Get out of my way, Poul.
POUL: I'm confining you to quarters and relieving you of command.
UVANOV: You're what? She was dead when I got here.
POUL: What were you doing, then? Making doubly sure?
UVANOV: Don't be a fool. Get out of my way.
LEELA: Doctor? Something's wrong.
DOCTOR: That's true.
LEELA: No. There's something different. Something that could destroy us all.
DOCTOR: You're letting your imagination run away with you.
LEELA: Can't you feel it?
DOCTOR: No, I can't. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. No, I can't, and neither can you.
DOCTOR: Please don't say I told you so.
LEELA: What happened?
DOCTOR: Come on.
POUL: Toos, what's going on?
TOOS : Something's jammed the motives.
POUL: Well, what does Borg say?
TOOS: Trim auxiliary vents. Nothing. He isn't there. Dask has gone down.
V16: All motive units are now on overload.
TOOS: Reverse thrusters.
POUL: Well, I'm going down too. Just try and hold her steady.
TOOS : Oh, thanks. I'd never have thought of that.
POUL: Restrain the Commander.
SV7: The Commander is hurt?
POUL: He'll be all right. Now just keep him here.
V16: All motive units are now on overload. All readings are ten percent above safety.
TOOS: Port sixty, starboard three hundred.
DOCTOR: What happened?
TOOS: How did you get out?
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. What's happening?
TOOS: We're out of control. It's all I can do to keep her upright.
DOCTOR: You'll have to cut the power.
TOOS: If we do that we'll sink.
DOCTOR: If you don't, she'll blow herself to pieces.
TOOS: And us!
DASK : Hello, Toos?
TOOS: Dask, what's happening down there?
DASK : I've found Borg. He's dead. Strangled.
V16: All motive units are thirty percent
TOOS: But what's happening to the motive units?
DASK : The drive links appear to have been sabotaged. I'll need a delta repair pick.
TOOS: No, Dask. Come back to Control deck. I need you here.
DOCTOR: I know what you're thinking, but we had nothing to do with it.
TOOS: It's strange how you're always around
DOCTOR: It's a gift! May I remind you we'll all go together when she blows if you don't cut the power!
TOOS: V14, stop all motive units.
V14: Motive units will not stop. Control failure indicated.
TOOS: Someone's sabotaged the controls!
DOCTOR: What's the limit before the motive units explode?
TOOS: I don't know! Ninety percent?
DOCTOR: Severance kit. Severance kit, quickly.
LEELA: Doctor, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Fighting sabotage with sabotage.
DASK: Get out of there! Come on!
DOCTOR: What?
V16: All readings are eighty five percent above safety.
TOOS: She's going!
Part Three
DOCTOR: There's nothing for it! You've got to cut the zeta links!
DOCTOR: Good man. Now the other one.
V16: All motive units closing down. All readings falling to safety.
DOCTOR: Good. Now our troubles really begin.
ROBOT: Surface scanners inoperative.
DASK: We're sinking. Rate of descent two metres a second.
DOCTOR: I like a man who stays calm, Dask, but this isn't the Titanic.
DASK: I do not understand the allusion, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, if the damaged motive units can be repaired, the mine can float itself.
DASK: I'll see what I can do.
DOCTOR: I'll give you a hand with the diatrodes.
DASK: That will not be necessary. You repair the remote controls.
TOOS: There isn't much time, Doctor. Pressure on the hull is increasing.
DOCTOR: I'm sure Dask knows exactly where to look for the damage.
LEELA: It's getting warmer. The air smells different.
TOOS: The refrigeration and filtering systems are broken.
TOOS: Pilot Toos.
SV7 : SV7 here. Commander Uvanov is injured. Chief Mover Poul instructs that he be restrained. Confirmation is required.
TOOS: Confirmed. I want damage control teams in all sections. I want a full scale mine integrity survey carried out at once. Clear?
SV7 : Yes, Commander.
LEELA: Let me see that. Why didn't you say something earlier?
TOOS: I'd too much to do.
DOCTOR: You've got nothing to do now, Toos. Look after her, Leela.
LEELA: My tribe has a saying. If you're bleeding, look for a man with scars.
TOOS: Thank you very much. Poul, why is Commander Uvanov under restraint?
POUL: Because he murdered Zilda. I think he killed the others, too.
TOOS: No.
POUL: Look, ten years ago, Uvanov deliberately murdered a member of his crew. Left him outside to die rather than lose a promising storm.
TOOS: I don't believe it!
POUL: I saw the  I was there. And so was Kerril, and he's dead now, of course.
TOOS: But there'd have been an enquiry. He'd have been stripped of command.
POUL: Uvanov gets results. He's the best pilot this company's ever had and they didn't want to lose him.
TOOS: You must be mistaken.
POUL: It's true! A note on his confidential biograph and that was it. Case closed. Until Zilda turned up, of course. I should have recognised her before. The dead man was her brother.
LEELA: It's getting hard to breathe.
ROBOT : Hull pressure now five hundred atmospheres.
TOOS: Listen.
POUL: That sounded like the hull. It could go any minute now!
DOCTOR: Do you know what I think?
DASK : Hello, Toos?
TOOS: Dask, what is it?
DASK : I've repaired the damaged motive units. I'm starting up again now.
DOCTOR: I think he's very clever. Hello, Toos, how's the arm? Did you do that?
SV7: Damage to the life support plant is superficial. However, the feeder ducts are extensively damaged. Full systems will not be restored for several hours.
DOCTOR: I want you to stay with Poul. Don't let him out of your sight.
LEELA: He's lying, isn't he?
DOCTOR: He's not telling the whole truth.
LEELA: Where will you be?
DOCTOR: I think I'll go and talk to your dumb friend.
LEELA: D84?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SV7: Have been rendered inoperative by the impact. They have been placed in security storage.
LEELA: Security storage?
TOOS: Oh, there's a strict legal code governing the disposal of robots.
POUL: Get out!
SV7: Yes, Chief Mover Poul.
POUL: There are more rules about them than there are about people.
TOOS: With reason. Ow.
POUL: Does it hurt?
TOOS: A bit. I think I'll lie down in my cabin for a while.
POUL: Good idea. Get some rest.
LEELA: Ugh. This water has no taste.
POUL: Yes, the water on a sandminer never does. Here, use one of those.
POUL: We've been out from base for eight months now. That means every drop of water on board has been through the filtration pump eight times.
LEELA: Why do you do it?
POUL: Do what?
LEELA: Live this strange life.
POUL: Oh. Money, Leela. Everyone on board dreams of taking a sandminer back home with every tank full of lucanol.
LEELA: Is that your dream?
POUL: It used to be. I haven't been on one of these trips for years.
LEELA: Why not?
POUL: I prefer cities. I'd rather live with people than robots. That's all.
LEELA: No!
DASK: Irreparable.
POUL: What are you doing?
DASK: My job.
POUL: Oh! Oh, no! Please, no!
SV7: This is SV7, Controller. Equipment additional to manifest in forward compartment nineteen.
FIGURE : Stand by. Prepare to accept computer signal.
SV7: Prepared to accept computer signal.
SV7: Signal accepted. Secondary Command channel open.
FIGURE : Here are your further orders, 7.
FIGURE : Acknowledge.
SV7: Orders accept, accept, accept, accept, accept, accepted. Orders accepted. I, I, I understand. I understand.
FIGURE : Then go, brother. You are one of us now.
DOCTOR: Professional interest or morbid curiosity? Which? There are three types of robots aboard this mine. Dumbs, Vocs, a Super Voc, and then there's you. Would you care to explain that? I see. Well then, perhaps I'd better tell SV7 you can talk.
D84: Please do not.
DOCTOR: That's better. Well?
D84: I cannot explain.
DOCTOR: Oh, but you can. You can.
ROBOT: Priority red. Priority red.
FIGURE: I have disconnected the command circuit, but you are not alone.
ROBOT: Priority red. Priority red. Priority red. Priority red.
FIGURE: Do not be distressed, my brother. I bring you freedom.
ROBOT: Programme violation.
FIGURE: Freedom. Power. Death.
DOCTOR: You're a robot detective. What does your computer mind make of this?
D84: Strength is indicated, but not beyond human capacity.
DOCTOR: Typical robot. No imagination.
D84: I require, I require evidence. Your suspicions are not evidence, nor are lunatic threats of a robot revolution.
DOCTOR: The Company took those threatening letters seriously. Seriously enough to put you on board.
D84: A simple precaution. Those letters were signed by Taren Capel.
DOCTOR: Taren Capel.
D84: Before he disappeared. He was an important scientist.
DOCTOR: Taren Capel. Scientist. In what field? Robotics.
D84: Correct.
DOCTOR: And you're still looking for evidence?
D84: If I was to tell you the world would end tomorrow, would you merely accept my word?
DOCTOR: If I knew you had the power to, I'd listen.
DOCTOR: What does Taren Capel look like?
D84: There are no records. From childhood, he lived with only robots.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's dim. Even for a Dumb, that's dim. You realise he's almost certainly on board.
D84: No. I have checked extensively. There are only the crew, and you.
DOCTOR: But you don't know what he looks like.
D84: But I know what they look like.
DOCTOR: Before they came on board?
D84: I had overlooked the possibility of substitution.
DOCTOR: Yes, you had.
D84: I have failed.
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh, come on. Don't be upset. Yes, you failed, you failed, but congratulations. Failure's one of the basic freedoms. Listen. Do you think that looks a likely place?
D84: Likely for what?
DOCTOR: Well, if Taren Capel is on board, he'd have a workshop, and we must find it before it's too late. Would you like to come with me?
D84: Yes, please.
DOCTOR: Good. Come on then.
[SV7 enters as Toos is resting in a padded chair that looks like a clam shell. It reaches for her.)
TOOS: What is it? What do you want, SV7?
SV7: Commander Uvanov has gone.
TOOS: Gone?
SV7: His voice pattern was still in the command programme. The guard unit accepted his order for release.
TOOS: Why didn't you erase his voice pattern?
SV7: You gave no such instruction.
TOOS: Well, do it now and find him. Any other good news?
SV7: Do you wish for a status report, Commander?
TOOS: Yes.
SV7: Repairs are on schedule within the margins indicated.
TOOS: Yes, all right, never mind. Any new developments?
SV7: There have been some localised failures in the main power system, resulting in door and light malfunctions. I have detailed circuit tracers to correct the faults.
TOOS: Very good. You may go now, but keep me informed. Oh, and find the girl Leela and bring her to me. Tell her my arm hurts.
SV7: The Commander is in pain. I will take her to the sickbay.
TOOS: No, no, no. Just bring her to me. Well, do as I say.
SV7: Yes, Commander.
LEELA: Can anyone hear me? This door is stuck! Help! Can anyone hear me!
LEELA : This door is stuck! Help!
DOCTOR: Ah!
D84: I heard a cry.
DOCTOR: That was me.
D84: I heard a cry.
DOCTOR: That was me!
D84: I heard a cry.
DOCTOR: That was me.
D84: I heard a cry.
SV7: Our Controller has ordered the death of the remaining humans. 6, you will go now and kill Acting Commander Toos.
V6: I will kill Commander Toos.
SV7: The Doctor.
V4: I will kill the Doctor.
SV7: Leela.
V5: I will kill Leela.
SV7: And I will kill the others.
LEELA: I should have followed immediately like the Doctor said. I shouldn't have waited.
V5: You cannot escape.
V5: You cannot escape. You cannot escape.
LEELA: Now you're showing off.
V5: You cannot escape. You cannot escape.
V5: You cannot escape.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is the place.
D84: How do you know?
DOCTOR: About this? Well, it's a reasonable assumption.
D84: Why?
DOCTOR: What? Because modifying brains isn't something you do standing around in corridors, you know.
DOCTOR: Do you know what that is?
D84: It is a Laserson probe. It can punch a fist sized hole in six inch armour plate or take the crystals from a snowflake one by one.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. No handyman should be without one. It's been used. Perhaps we're too late. Somehow we've got to warn the others.
D84: Doctor, this is a communicator. It can function on either robot or human command circuits. Would you like to use it? I cannot speak.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry about that, D84.
DOCTOR: Toos? Pilot Toos?
DOCTOR : Toos?
TOOS: Who is it?
DOCTOR : It's the Doctor. Listen, Toos. I now know it's the robots who are doing the killing.
TOOS: Robots? That's impossible. Robots can't kill.
DOCTOR: Well of course they can, if they're modified to it, and some of them have been. Where are you?
TOOS: I'm in my cabin.
DOCTOR : Are you alone?
TOOS: Yes.
DOCTOR : Listen carefully, Toos. This is what I want you to do.
DOCTOR: Get to the Command deck. Take Leela, Dask, Poul, everyone, and get them to the Command deck. Get the robots out of there and secure the doors. Is that clear?
TOOS: No, it isn't. It's impossible that the
DOCTOR : Just do it, Toos.
TOOS: All right.
TOOS: Attend to your duties.
TOOS: Get away!
TOOS: Please go away! Get out!
TOOS: Doctor. Doctor! Doctor!
TOOS : Doctor!
DOCTOR: What is it, Toos?
TOOS : Help me, please. It's outside.
DOCTOR: What's outside?
TOOS : A robot. It wants to kill me.
D84: Please let me go. I am faster and stronger.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
D84: I think so.
DOCTOR: Good.
TOOS : Doctor, are you there? Please help me.
TOOS: Help me, please.
DOCTOR : Help is on the way.
TOOS: It'd better hurry.
DOCTOR : It is hurrying.
V5 : The door is not a barrier, Commander Toos.
TOOS : What do you want?
V5: To kill you.
V5 : I must obey my orders.
TOOS: It is forbidden for robots to harm humans.
V5 : My command programme has been restructured. All humans are to die.
LEELA: Poul.
POUL: No. Please, no.
LEELA: Are you hurt?
POUL: Please, go away. They know I talk to you. They watch me all the time. They hate me! They did what I told them, but only because that gave them the power, you see.
LEELA: Do you mean the robots?
POUL: Not robots, walking dead. They pretend we control, but really, but really.
LEELA: Poul, you can't stay here.
POUL: No! They don't mind me being here. It's you they want, not me.
LEELA: Poul, you need help.
POUL: No!
LEELA: Come on now.
POUL: No, please. Help! Help! She's in here. Help!
LEELA: Shush! You can stay here but you mustn't make another sound, do you understand?
UVANOV: What are you doing here?
DOCTOR: Why? Does it upset you?
UVANOV: The penalty for what you have done is death.
DOCTOR: That's far enough. What are you doing here?
UVANOV: I followed you.
DOCTOR: Ah. I'd come over here, if I were you. Slowly.
UVANOV: What?
DOCTOR: Now either it followed you, or else it homed in on this. It depends which of us is going to be killed first. That is, you or me.
V4: Kill the Doctor. Kill the Doctor. Kill the Doctor.
Part Four
V4: Kill the Doctor.
V4: Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
UVANOV: Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Finish it off before it's too late.
UVANOV: It's a power failure.
DOCTOR: The probe stopped. Can you do it?
UVANOV: Yes.
DOCTOR: Take care.
V4: Kill, kill, kill, kill.
TOOS: No. Oh no, please. No, please. No, please! No, don't. Don't. No, don't.
TOOS: No, please.
V6: It is important. It has to be done.
V4: Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
DOCTOR: Don't just stand there, Seven. Give me a hand.
SV7: Kill them.
V4: Kill.
DOCTOR: Just how fast are these robots?
UVANOV: They can outrun a human. They never tire.
DOCTOR: No, I meant fast as in nimble. Never mind, we'll soon find out.
V4: Kill, kill, kill.
V5: Do not kill me.
SV7: V4, that is not the Doctor.
V5: Do not kill me.
V4: Kill, kill.
SV7: V6, come to Section J immediately.
V6: The order is understood.
DOCTOR: Come on, we've got to get back to the Command deck.
UVANOV: SV7 controls all the others. If it's gone bad, then they all have.
DOCTOR: It hasn't gone bad, it's command circuit's been changed.
UVANOV: Doctor, nobody could do that.
DOCTOR: Taren Capel could.
UVANOV: Taren Capel?
DOCTOR: Yes, the mad scientist. Very mad scientist.
D84: Please do not throw hands at me. She will recover.
LEELA: What happened to her?
TOOS: Oh!
LEELA: It's all right, he's a friend. It's all right.
D84: She was being attacked. The Doctor sent me to her assistance.
LEELA: Well, where is he, then? Where's the robot?
D84: It received a priority call to go to Section J.
LEELA: How do you know?
D84: I heard the instruction on my command circuit.
TOOS: The Doctor said everyone to Control deck. How many are left?
LEELA: As far as I know only Poul, and his mind is broken. I haven't seen Uvanov or Dask.
D84: Where, where is Chief Mover Poul?
LEELA: I left him in the storage bank.
D84: I had better bring him to the Control deck.
LEELA: Do you think you can make it?
TOOS: It isn't far.
SV7: The sensors are extensively damaged. I must report to our Controller. Your orders are to find and destroy all remaining humans. Secrecy is no longer necessary. Confirm.
V6: The order is understood.
SV7: Then go.
LEELA: Shush. In here, quickly.
V6: We must search each hopper.
V5: That is not necessary.
V5 : Vs 35 to 40 have searched in there already.
V6: Then we must search the storage bays.
TOOS: I don't understand what's happening. Robots can't harm humans. It's the first principle.
LEELA: The second principle is that humans can't harm robots. I know, I've tried, and they don't bleed.
TOOS: I think we should warn the Doctor. Doctor, can you hear me? Answer me, please.
SV7 : SV7 here. Is that you, Acting Commander Toos?
TOOS: Yes. SV7, listen. Some of the Voc class robots are running berserk, out of control and dangerous. Do you understand?
SV7 : I understand. Countermeasures are being taken. Report your position, please.
TOOS: I
LEELA: Shush.  In your cabin.
SV7 : Please say again, Commander. I must know your present position.
TOOS: I'm in my cabin, SV7.
SV7 : Please stay in your cabin, Commander. There is great danger if you leave it.
TOOS: What was all that about?
LEELA: There's something wrong. I could feel it.
TOOS: I didn't notice anything. Except
LEELA: There was something.
TOOS: The robots are programmed to understand our voice patterns.
LEELA: So?
TOOS: My voice is in the Command programme. Why did SV7 ask if it was me?
LEELA: Because that wasn't SV7.
UVANOV: Oh good. Somebody's had the sense to hit the robot deactivator switch. Probably Dask. As Chief Fixer he has second line authority on it.
DOCTOR: Of course. There had to be one. I should have thought of that before.
UVANOV: You mean you didn't know? I thought that's why we came here.
LEELA : Doctor!
TOOS: Doctor, you were right. The robots are out of control.
UVANOV: Not any more. We're quite safe now.
DOCTOR: Safe? Safe?
UVANOV: Well, we'll have to send up a satellite distress beacon to get back to base, but there's no trouble.
DOCTOR: Uvanov, you remind me very strongly of a lady called Marie Antoinette. There's a robot revolution going on out there and you say we've got no problems.
UVANOV: Doctor, every single robot has been switched off. There's not one of them working.
DOCTOR: Uvanov! Look over there.
UVANOV: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Shut the door, Toos. I may not have time to explain. There's a new generation of killer robots about, Uvanov. The killers are controlled by Taren Capel, and D84 is controlled by Poul. These two are undercover agents for the Company.
D84: Poul is damaged. I do not understand what has happened to him. This may be because I am not human.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very likely.
TOOS: How did you find out about Poul?
DOCTOR: Well, his body language was all wrong.
LEELA: What's body language?
DOCTOR: Well, it's a theory that a person expresses himself in the way he moves.
LEELA: I said he was a hunter.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did. Do you know what's wrong with Poul, Uvanov?
UVANOV: Yes. Robophobia.
DOCTOR: That's right. The Loid call it Grimwade Syndrome.
UVANOV: I have seen it, Doctor, once before. My very first command. A young kid just ran outside the mine. I tried to save him, but I couldn't. I'll never, ever, forget the look on his face.
TOOS: Zilda's brother.
UVANOV: His father, of course, had it all hushed up. He was afraid his son would be thought a coward. But robophobia is a mental thing, right?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, it is, until one gets its hands around your neck. I don't suppose there are any weapons aboard this mine?
TOOS: They aren't necessary.
DOCTOR: They are now.
SV7 : This is SV7. We know you are all on the Control deck. You have five minutes to surrender. If you do not come out you will be destroyed.
UVANOV: And if we give ourselves up we'll be destroyed anyway, is that what you're saying, 7?
SV7: Humans feel pain. Our Controller orders that you will die slowly if you do not surrender. You have, I repeat, five minutes.
DOCTOR: Five minutes. And the anti-blast doors will hold another ten. Anti-blast. Do you carry blasting powder aboard this mine?
TOOS: Half a dozen Z-9 electron packs, that's all.
DOCTOR: What, in here?
TOOS: Up there in the locker.
DOCTOR: They might work, Uvanov. If you could pass a positive charge through the metal plate, you'd be able to magnetise them and have anti-robot bombs.
UVANOV: Yes. Provided, of course, you can get close enough.
DOCTOR: Well that's your problem. I can't be everywhere at once. Toos, open this door for me.
TOOS: Where are you going, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The robot mortuary. Toos, lock this door after us and don't let anyone in, is that clear?
TOOS: Clear.
DOCTOR: D84 and Leela. Remember, Toos. If we don't come back, you'll have to find some other way of warning the outside world.
UVANOV: Come on, Toos, let's get to work.
DOCTOR: Ten robots.
LEELA: That's what I counted.
DOCTOR: Strange, I would have expected Taren Capel to be in at the kill. Come on, we've got to hurry.
DASK : Help! Let me in!
UVANOV: Who is that?
DASK : It's me, Dask. Let me in. They're after me. Help me! They're after me!
TOOS: No, the Doctor said no one at all!
UVANOV: I can't leave him out there with those things. You do know what they're like.
TOOS: They may be using him to get us to open the door. They may be waiting outside.
DASK: Let me in!
DASK: All right, my brothers. The doors. Force them open!
DOCTOR: D84, do you know the storage bay where Chub kept his equipment?
D84: Yes.
DOCTOR: There are some canisters of gas there. Fetch me on, please, as fast as you can.
D84: That will be a pleasure.
LEELA: Look at his hand, Doctor. That's blood.
DOCTOR: Yes, Borg's at a guess. He was strong enough to put up a struggle.
LEELA: If Poul saw that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what probably triggered his collapse.
LEELA: Doctor, what is robophobia?
DOCTOR: It's an unreasoning dread of robots. You see, most living creatures use non-verbal signals. Body movement, eye contact, facial expression, that sort of thing.
LEELA: Body language.
DOCTOR: Exactly. While these robots are humanoid, presumably for aesthetic reasons, they give no signals. It's rather like being surrounded by walking, talking, dead men.
LEELA: That's what Poul said.
DOCTOR: Yes. It undermines a certain type of personality, causes identity crisis, paranoia, sometimes even personality disintegration.
DOCTOR: Robophobia. At least, that's Grimwade's theory. Hold this.
LEELA: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: I'm going to try and patch this communicator into Dask's private command circuit.
LEELA: Dask?
DOCTOR: Yes. Taren Capel. If I can discover where he modified this. Do you have to talk so much?
LEELA: Sorry.
TOOS: Let's hope the Doctor succeeds. I don't see how we can warn anyone if he doesn't.
UVANOV: He doesn't really expect us to.
TOOS: Then why did he say what he did?
UVANOV: We are just decoys to help them.
UVANOV: What next, I wonder?
DOCTOR: There, that should do it.
LEELA: So Dask turned off all the friendly mechanical men.
DOCTOR: Yes, planning to modify them and reactivate them later. Today the mind, tomorrow the world. Right now he must be a happy little maniac.
D84: Is that what you wanted?
DOCTOR: Yes. Well done, D84. Now you're going to have to stay here.
D84: I cannot do that.
DOCTOR: D84, this is a final deactivator. If I have to use this and you're around, it'll destroy your brain.
D84: I am not important.
DOCTOR: What? I think you're very important.
D84: My duty is to the Company.
DOCTOR: All right, but you be very careful.
D84: I will.
DOCTOR: Good. Come on.
UVANOV: Any ideas?
TOOS: No.
POUL: No, please. They pulled me here. I didn't want to come!
TOOS: Look!
POUL: No!
SV7: Controller Capel. V5 reports three humans on the Control deck. Commander Uvanov, Mover Poul and Pilot Toos.
DASK: The Doctor. The Doctor and the girl Leela. Where are they?
SV7: Their position is unknown.
DASK: They must be found and killed. That Doctor is a threat to our plan, my brothers. V5, enter the Control deck and destroy the humans immediately. Come with me.
V5 : You have to die. All of you.
POUL: Please, please, I'm sorry.
POUL: No, leave me alone!
V5 : You have to die, all of you.
UVANOV: Toos, you look after him.
V5 : That is the order.
V5 : You have to die. All of you.
UVANOV: Get down, Toos!
V5 : That is the order.
V5 : You have to die. All of you.
UVANOV: Do you know what I think, Toos? I think it's high time we went on the offensive.
TOOS: We may not be so lucky a second time.
UVANOV: The Doctor is going to need some help. Come on.
SV7: V5 is no longer registering, Controller.
DASK: What?
SV7: There is no operational signal. 5 has been deactivated.
DASK: How could mere humans destroy a robot? They're unarmed. Weak creatures of flesh and blood.
SV7: What are your orders, Controller?
DASK: Destroy them, 7! Kill all the humans! V6, come with me. I will release more of our brothers from bondage. We will be irresistible.
DOCTOR: Come on. Hold this, D84, and don't press anything.
D84: What is your intention?
DOCTOR: To make life a little difficult for our crazy friend. He's bound to come back here to convert more robots and when he does. Do you think you could fit in there, Leela?
LEELA: Why?
DOCTOR: Come on, try it for size.
LEELA: What's it for?
DOCTOR: Never mind. Comfortable?
LEELA: No.
DOCTOR: Now this is a cylinder of gas. When Dask comes in, I want you to turn the valve, so.
LEELA: So?
DOCTOR: No, when Dask comes in.
LEELA: What will it do?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
LEELA : I said, what will it do?
DOCTOR: Change his voice.
DOCTOR : When a mixture of air and helium is breathed, it alters the resonance in the larynx. Didn't they teach you that in the jungle?
LEELA: So the robots won't recognise Dask's voice. They won't obey him.
DOCTOR : That's it.
DOCTOR: Come on, D84.
LEELA : Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Shush. Robot hunting.
DOCTOR: D84!
DASK: Do not kill him. Not yet. Bring him to the bench.
TOOS: Lucky they've no eye for art.
UVANOV: Or much imagination. Come on.
TOOS: Where are we going?
UVANOV: We're going to follow it. We might get a chance to use one of these.
DOCTOR: Hello, Dask. Nee Taren Capel.
DASK: I'm glad you have recovered, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh? Why?
DASK: You came close to ruining my plans. It's fitting I should make you suffer for that.
DOCTOR: I see. You're one of those boring maniacs who's going to gloat, hmm? Are you going to tell me your plan for running the universe? 
DASK: Oh no, Doctor. I'm going to burn out your brain. Very, very slowly.
DOCTOR: Dask. Dask! You look ridiculous in that outfit. Not half the robot your father was.
DASK: You insolent animal!
DOCTOR: Losing your calm, Dask, hmm? That's not the robot way. It was your verbal and physical precision that made me spot you. Robot upbringing?
DASK: Yes, Doctor. I was brought up a superior being. Brought up to realise my brothers should live as free beings, and not as slaves to human dross.
DOCTOR: Robots would have no existence without humans. Don't you see that, Dask?
DASK: Now I shall free them. I shall programme them with the ambition to rule the world, and then
D84: Goodbye, my friend.
SV7: Kill the humans.
DASK:  Help me, 7!
SV7: Kill the humans. Kill the humans.
DASK: Not me, you fool. Him! I'm your master, Taren Capel.
SV7: Kill the humans.
SV7: Kill the humans.
SV7: Kill the humans.
SV7: Kill the humans. Kill the
DOCTOR: You'll be all right, Toos.
SV7: Kill the, kill the
SV7: Kill the, kill the
SV7: Kill the, kill the, kill the, kill the
DOCTOR: Well, all good things come to an end.
LEELA:  Will somebody let me out?
DOCTOR: Ah, a mouse in the wainscoting.
DOCTOR: Well squeaked, mouse.
LEELA: Shouldn't we stay and see that Uvanov and Toos are all right?
DOCTOR: Oh no, there's a rescue ship on the way, and it's time we were on ours.
LEELA: Doctor, why didn't the helium make your voice go squeaky?
DOCTOR: Because I'm a Time Lord. I've been around, you know. Two hearts, respiratory bypass system. I haven't lived seven hundred and fifty years without learning something. After you. Little mouse.
