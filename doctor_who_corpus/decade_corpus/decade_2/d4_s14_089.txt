The Face of Evil
Part One
CALIB: You are the leader, Andor. It is for you to decide. But there can be but one punishment for such a heresy. Banishment.
ANDOR: What say you, Sole?
SOLE:  You know you should not ask.
ANDOR: Then it is agreed. You must be sent beyond.
TOMAS: No! She's young, she spoke rashly.
LEELA: Don't beg, Tomas. What I said was the truth.
NEEVA: What she said profaned the holy purpose of the tribe of Sevateem.
LEELA: Holy purpose? To die in another useless attack?
NEEVA: The great god Xoanon demands that she be cast out. He told me this.
LEELA: Liar! There is no Xoanon.
NEEVA: Blasphemy!
ANDOR: Leela, will you take the test of the Horda?
ANDOR: Will any take it for her?
SOLE: I will.
LEELA: No. You'll be killed too.
SOLE: Be silent, daughter. You have said enough.
ANDOR: Test him.
LEELA: Andor, please, call them back. What I said, I was wrong. Forgive me, please. Neeva, greatest shaman, Speaker of Law, forgive me, please.
ANDOR: Be silent, girl. Your father was a warrior. Do not shame him.
ANDOR: Outcast of the tribe of Sevateem, be gone from us.
NEEVA: Spawn of the evil one, return to your master.
ANDOR: You have until sunrise. If you are still within the boundary then, you must be thrown to the Horda.
DOCTOR: I think this is not Hyde Park. Could be a nexial discontinuity. Must remember to overhaul those tracers. Put a knot in my hanky.
DOCTOR: I wonder what that was for. Little look round, Doctor? Why not.
LEELA: Tomas. What are you doing here?
TOMAS: I've come to take you back.
LEELA: You can't.
TOMAS: I saw Neeva send them. We can tell the council.
LEELA: It won't make any difference. Not now.
TOMAS: You can't cross the boundary.
LEELA: They didn't leave me much choice.
TOMAS: There are phantoms in the beyond.
LEELA: Feast fire stories.
TOMAS: Well, there's something there.
LEELA: Then I'll face it. I can take care of myself.
TOMAS: I'll go with you.
LEELA: No. Go back to the tribe. I'm going now. Goodbye, Tomas. Beware of the devious Calib. One day he'll get so cunning even he won't know what he's planned.
DOCTOR: Hello. Hello, did I startle you? Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
LEELA: The Evil One.
DOCTOR: Well, nobody's perfect, but that's overstating it a little. I'm the Doctor. What's your name?
LEELA: Leela.
DOCTOR: Leela. A nice name, Leela. I never met anyone called Leela. Would you like a jelly baby?
LEELA: It's true, then. They say the Evil One eats babies.
DOCTOR: You mustn't believe all they say. No, these are sweets. They're rather good. Go on, have one.
DOCTOR: Go on.
DOCTOR: Leela. Leela, either you've got four friends with very bad colds, or we're in danger. Which is it?
LEELA: They're your creatures.
DOCTOR: They are? I wonder if they know that. What are they like?
LEELA: They can't be seen.
DOCTOR: Ah.
LEELA: They are phantoms.
DOCTOR: Invisible. We've got a chance.
LEELA: A magic talisman?
DOCTOR: No, it's a clockwork egg timer. To our friends, whatever they are, the visible spectrum is irrelevant. They're blind. Crudely speaking, they home in on vibrations.
DOCTOR: Now, Leela
LEELA: They've gone.
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. I want you to do exactly as I say. You and I are going to walk away from here very slowly and very quietly. And no matter what happens, you mustn't cry out or make any sudden move. And above all, you mustn't run until I tell you. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Good. Now come on. Come on.
DOCTOR: Freeze.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: Shush!
DOCTOR: Now tread carefully.
DOCTOR: Saved by the bell. Come on. Come on.
TOMAS: Calib! Calib, wait. I don't know if you're interested, but Neeva sent two men in secret to try and kill Leela.
CALIB: I'm interested, Tomas.
TOMAS: They failed.
CALIB: Neeva is making mistakes.
TOMAS: You must call a council meeting and tell them.
CALIB: Tell them what?
TOMAS: That he broke the law.
CALIB: Oh, don't be naive, Tomas. Even if the council believed it, don't you think Neeva would have an answer? He's the Speaker of Law.
TOMAS: There must be something we can do?
CALIB: There is. You know he's promised us victory in the raid.
TOMAS: What more would you expect?
CALIB: No, he's promised us! He says Xoanon has told him we will win. You see what that means?
TOMAS: That he will look a fool if we don't.
CALIB: More than that. He's going to look like the charlatan he is. Then we can move against him and that puppet, Andor.
TOMAS: Many men are going to die, Calib. We should stop the raid!
CALIB: Leela tried.
TOMAS: And she's probably dead.
LEELA: Stop, we're safe now. We can rest. The creatures won't cross the boundary.
DOCTOR: How can you be sure?
LEELA: They never have. You should know that.
DOCTOR: I keep on telling you, I'm not the Evil One. Who was it saved your life?
LEELA: You did.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Never cross the boundary? You know something? I'm sure those creatures don't stay on their side of the boundary out of a sense of fair play. There must be a fence of some kind.
LEELA: A fence?
DOCTOR: Yes, a fence.
XOANON : Neeva! Neeva!
NEEVA: Speak, lord, for your servant hears.
XOANON : The girl Leela has returned across the boundary. You have failed.
NEEVA: O great god Xoanon, I have faithfully done all that you commanded of me.
XOANON : You crawling thing, do you presume to argue?
NEEVA: No, master. Forgive me.
XOANON : She and the one who is with her must be destroyed. See that it is done.
DOCTOR: Got it. Low intensity sonic disrupter set in a hundred and eighty degree spread. Simple but effective.
LEELA: Does that keep away the phantoms?
DOCTOR: Yes. It gives them a nasty headache if they go too close. They're probably set at intervals along the whole boundary.
DOCTOR: The technology's quite advanced, so you didn't put them there.
LEELA: Xoanon!
DOCTOR: Xoanon? What's those?
LEELA: He's worshiped by the tribe.
DOCTOR: What, he's a god?
LEELA: Yes. I was cast out for speaking against him.
DOCTOR: Really.
LEELA: It's said he's held captive.
DOCTOR: By whom?
LEELA: By the Evil One and his followers, the Tesh. Maybe there is a holy purpose. I don't know what to believe anymore.
DOCTOR: Well, that sounds healthy anyway, Leela. Never be certain of anything. It's a sign of weakness. Now, where's this Xoanon held?
LEELA: Within the Black Wall, wherein lies Paradise.
DOCTOR: Is that just religious gobbledygook, or is that an actual place?
LEELA: There is a Wall.
DOCTOR: Is there. Will you show me?
ANDOR: Why has the game disappeared from the land? Where is the love of Xoanon for his people? Where is your magic?
NEEVA: Xoanon knows there are those amongst the people who do not wish to fight.
ANDOR: And so he starves us?
NEEVA: No, but how can he bless people who do not love him? There will be food for those who brave the Wall in his name.
ANDOR: Men do not fight well on empty stomachs!
NEEVA: The Wall will be at its weakest soon. Soon you can call the warriors and I will speak the litany.
ANDOR: Do not delay too long.
ANDOR: Well, Tomas?
TOMAS: There's something I wish to say.
ANDOR: Yes?
TOMAS: You should know that I agreed with Leela about the attack. It's madness. Many of us will die and we shall achieve nothing.
ANDOR: Nevertheless, we shall attack.
ANDOR : It is the will of Xoanon.
TOMAS : We only have Neeva's word for that.
ANDOR: We must have faith.
TOMAS: In the word of an assassin? He sent men to try and kill Leela, but perhaps you already knew that.
ANDOR: Watch your tongue, boy! And don't let me hear you speak against the attack again. We shall strive to free Xoanon from the Tesh, and we will do it together, as one people.
TOMAS: Yes, Andor.
ANDOR: Come, Tomas
LEELA: Shush.
DOCTOR: What is it?
LEELA: I thought I heard something.
DOCTOR: What?
LEELA: Into cover, quick.
DOCTOR: I don't. Leela? Leela, where are you?
LEELA: Over here.
DOCTOR: What? This is no time to be playing games.
LEELA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: You don't understand? If they're preparing for a battle, they're hardly likely to send men on patrol on the off-chance that you might come back.
DOCTOR: On the other hand, I could be wrong about that.
: Stand still!
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely.  Keep down, Leela, and get moving.
LEELA:  I can't leave you. They'll kill you.
DOCTOR: : Go away.  That was either very good shooting or very bad. Either way, I wouldn't dream of moving.
WARRIOR: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Who are you and why are you shooting at me?
WARRIOR: Where is Leela?
DOCTOR: Who?
WARRIOR: Spread out. She must be here somewhere.
DOCTOR: Look, would you mind if I turned round? I feel a bit silly talking to this tree.
WARRIOR: The Evil One.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, you too. Well then, tread softly, gentlemen, or I'll turn you into toads.
DOCTOR: That gesture you did. Yes, that's the one. It's presumably to ward off evil. It's interesting because it's also the sequence for checking the seals on a Starfall Seven spacesuit. And what makes that particularly interesting is that you don't know what a Starfall Seven spacesuit is, do you.
DOCTOR: Now drop your weapons, or I'll kill him with this deadly jelly baby.
WARRIOR: Kill him, then.
DOCTOR: What?
WARRIOR: Kill him, then.
DOCTOR: I don't take orders from anyone.
DOCTOR: Take me to your leader.
ANDOR: Bring it forth.
DOCTOR: Good evening. I think you're going to be very happy I came here tonight.
NEEVA: Hi ya, hi ya.
DOCTOR: I'd be careful of that if I were you. It's an ultrabeam accelerator.
NEEVA: See how it fears the sacred relics of Xoanon.
DOCTOR: If there happens to be a charge in there, you could transform this whole village into a smoky hole in the ground.
NEEVA: Hear how it threatens us.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, look, if you'll just untie my hands, I think I have an idea of what's going on. I may be able to help.
NEEVA: Hear how it squirms for release. Hey, hi ya. Ah, it cannot deceive us.
DOCTOR: Oh no, I can see you're a person of very superior intellect.  Are you the leader of this tribe, or his he?
ANDOR: Bring it closer.
ANDOR: Will you release our god Xoanon?
DOCTOR: Well, gladly, if I was holding him prisoner, but I'm not.
ANDOR: Then you must be destroyed, that we may release him.
DOCTOR: Eh?
NEEVA: Wait, Andor. Call the warriors together and I will speak the litany. Then it shall be destroyed before them and they will know that victory is ours.
ANDOR: Very well.
NEEVA: I will prepare myself.
ANDOR: Guard, give the signal.
DOCTOR: Don't hurry on my account.
ANDOR: I cannot believe it.
DOCTOR: Andor, listen to me.
ANDOR: No. No!
DOCTOR: Andor, please listen to me. I am not the Evil One. I am a traveller, that's all. Your tribe has obviously been visited by travellers before.
ANDOR: Before? But that is impossible.
DOCTOR: They're space travellers, Andor. Men from another world. The whole place is littered with their equipment, their weapons and tools. Your legend of a captive god is obviously related to them in some way.
ANDOR: Guard it well.
DOCTOR: Andor, please think about what
ANDOR: Its words are evil.
DOCTOR: Andor.
ANDOR: Do not listen to him!
DOCTOR: Andor, killing me isn't going to help you. It isn't going to do me much good either, is it.
NEEVA: Let the tribe of the Sevateem partake of your strength, Xoanon, that they may inherit your kingdom. Hear thy servant Neeva. Hear the shaman of the Sevateem. Hear my prayer.
NEEVA: Lugo, when I reach the end of the litany, you know what to do.
NEEVA: Our fathers of the tribe of Sevateem were sent forth by God to seek Paradise.
ALL: And still we seek.
NEEVA: They searched and found it not. While they searched, the tribe of Tesh.
ALL: Cursed be the cowards of Tesh.
NEEVA: Remained at the place of land, betrayed our fathers.
ALL: Death to the betrayers of Tesh.
ALL : Death to the betrayers of Tesh.
NEEVA : Made a pact with the Evil One, and God turned his face from us.
NEEVA : And the Evil One raised the Tower of Immolo and the Black Wall and gave them to the tribe of Tesh.
DOCTOR: How did you do that?
LEELA: Janis thorn. It paralyses, then kills. There's no cure.
ALL : Cursed be the tribe of Tesh.
DOCTOR: What?
LEELA: It was necessary.
ALL : Cursed be the tribe of Tesh.
LEELA: Come on.
NEEVA: The tribe of Tesh stand between the sons of the tribe of Sevateem and Xoanon, god of their fathers. We must kill the servants of the Evil One.
ALL: Kill the Tesh. Kill the Tesh!
ALL : Kill the Tesh!
DOCTOR: No, listen. Listen.
LEELA: We haven't got time to listen.
ALL : Kill the Tesh!
LEELA: They're coming to the bit about killing the Evil One, and that's you! Have you forgotten?
NEEVA : Now is the time when the Sevateem shall rise in their wrath.
DOCTOR: Do you know this litany?
LEELA: Of course. We're taught it as children.
ALL : In the name of Xoanon.
DOCTOR: Good. Then let's go, and don't dawdle.
NEEVA: And kill their master, the Evil One!
ALL : Destroy it. Destroy it! Destroy it!
WARRIOR: It's escaped! The Evil One's escaped!
NEEVA: Find it! Find it! Search everywhere!
WARRIOR 2: Here! It's here!
DOCTOR: That wasn't necessary. Who licensed you to slaughter people? No more Janis thorns, you understand? Ever.
ANDOR: He must be recaptured. It is imperative.
TOMAS: Right, Andor.
ANDOR: Take four men and search beyond the village.
CALIB: Quickly. Quickly!
DOCTOR: This way.
LEELA: No, this way.
DOCTOR: What?
LEELA: This way.
CALIB: Neeva! Neeva!
NEEVA: Well?
CALIB: It got away, with Leela's help.
NEEVA: Devil-spawned witch.
CALIB: They will be found. Andor's organising search parties.
NEEVA: It's too late. Tell him the attack must not be delayed.
DOCTOR: Well now, it seems I have been here before.
LEELA: That's the Evil One.
DOCTOR: Is it.
DOCTOR: I must have made quite an impression.
Part Two
LEELA: What happened? You must be able to remember.
DOCTOR: Well, of course I can remember. I'm trying to. Perhaps I was on another part of the planet.
LEELA: There is no other part. Only beyond the Wall.
DOCTOR: Beyond the Wall. I wonder.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush. I'm wondering. Back to the village.
LEELA: We can't!
DOCTOR: Why not?
LEELA: We'll be torn to pieces!
DOCTOR: Not if they don't catch us, we won't. Anyway, they'll be preparing for their battle.
LEELA: That's what you said last time.
DOCTOR: Well, you can't expect perfection, you know. Not even from me.
LEELA:  Oh, you.
ANDOR: The men refuse to attack while the Evil One is out there.
NEEVA: I have been thinking. We tell them it has been destroyed.
ANDOR: No! I will not lie to my people.
NEEVA: The Wall will be open for a very short time. We dare not delay. We must attack now, or you betray our god.
ANDOR: Has Xoanon commanded this?
NEEVA: He has.
ANDOR: Guard, sound the call.
ANDOR: You had better be right, Neeva, because servant of Xoanon or not, if we fail, I will kill you.
NEEVA: Xoanon has promised us victory.
ANDOR: No. He has promised you. And you have promised us.
DOCTOR:  I must examine those relics.
LEELA:  The village was dangerous enough, but the shrine of Xoanon?
NEEVA: Speak to me, Xoanon, that I may know your will. Speak, Xoanon. Speak.
WARRIOR : Shaman Neeva! It's time to leave!
NEEVA: I'm coming.
WARRIOR: Andor asks that you do not delay.
NEEVA: I said I'm coming!
DOCTOR: I like the hat. Very fetching.
LEELA: That was the Hand of Xoanon.
DOCTOR: That was an armoured space glove, or what was left of one.
ANDOR: The attack must begin at once.
NEEVA: Xoanon has spoken. We shall not fail.
DOCTOR: It's all clear.
DOCTOR: Amazing. You know, I had a feeling, I had a feeling that Neeva was actually expecting to hear an answer to his prayer.
LEELA: There wouldn't be much point in praying if he didn't.
DOCTOR: I could quote you a few theologians who'd give you an argument on that. He was listening.
DOCTOR: Hello? Intergalactic Operator? Hello? Over? Dead as a Dalek. There must be something.
LEELA: Why did you talk to that tube?
DOCTOR: I thought I recognised it.
XOANON : Neeva.
XOANON: Neeva!
DOCTOR: Poor old Neeva. Hotline to god. Psst. Don't be afraid. It's only a machine for sending voices over long distances. That may be Xoanon speaking, but it's not God. Gods don't use transceivers.
LEELA: Are you certain?
DOCTOR: Aren't you?
LEELA: Yes.
DOCTOR: That's better.
XOANON : Neeva. Neeva.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Neeva isn't here at the moment. Could I take a message? Over.
XOANON : At last we are here. At last. At last. Us.
DOCTOR: Us?
XOANON : You. Me. Us. We. At last I shall be free of us.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
XOANON : Don't I know?
DOCTOR: Leela, I have a feeling. Something nasty. Something I did. It seems like it.
LEELA: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: Who did that voice remind you of?
LEELA: You. It was your voice. How could that be?
DOCTOR: More to the point, who could that be? I must take a look at the Wall.
DOCTOR: It's a time barrier.
LEELA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: The principle's really quite simple. You just move everything forward a couple of seconds inside it. You get a barrier that's impervious to all energy. A true void. I've seen it done as a parlour trick, but never on this scale.
LEELA: Isn't there any way to get through it?
DOCTOR: Not unless whoever set it up deliberately bridged it.
LEELA: So that means Andor and the others
DOCTOR: Are walking into a trap, yes.
LEELA: Isn't there any way we can warn them?
DOCTOR: It's too late. Anyway, they wouldn't listen.
LEELA: Calib might. Let's try.
ANDOR: Attack!
ANDOR: Come on, attack!
TOMAS: Attack!
ALL: Attack! Attack!
NEEVA: Xoanon, protect your warriors and strengthen their arms, that they may free you.
TOMAS: Attack!
LEELA: Someone's coming.
DOCTOR: Hello, Calib. I was just thinking about you.
CALIB: So Neeva and Andor were lying.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't be surprised.
CALIB: Where's Leela?
LEELA: Behind you.
CALIB: Ah.
DOCTOR: How was the battle?
CALIB: Just as the old ones remembered the last time. The Wall closed up.
LEELA: A massacre?
CALIB: More than half the men were killed, and we never even saw the Tesh.
LEELA: You seem unhurt.
CALIB: There's no virtue in dying, Leela.
LEELA: That rather depends on what you do to avoid it.
DOCTOR: Leela, put the knife away. I'm sure he's a reasonable man.
CALIB: Thank you. So what do you want of me?
LEELA: We need someone's help.
DOCTOR: Leela seems to think it might be yours.
LEELA: The tribe is in desperate danger, Calib. The Doctor can help. He's the only one who can. But we must convince the others he's not the Evil One.
DOCTOR: Having first of all, of course, convinced you.
CALIB: I don't think you're the Evil One, and never have. I don't believe in ghosts.
DOCTOR: I'm impressed. Perhaps Leela's right about you.
CALIB: But if I'm to help, I need to know everything.
DOCTOR: There isn't much time. You see, Leela and I found an impenetrable barrier
CALIB: Janis thorn. Something you haven't thought of. Now stay where you are.
DOCTOR: I thought you were too easily convinced.
CALIB: I meant it. You're certainly not the Evil One, but the others think you are. Neeva said you'd been destroyed. You're just the evidence I need to break him.
DOCTOR: She underestimated your ambition.
CALIB: It's for the good of the tribe.
DOCTOR: Of course. This too.
CALIB: She would have opposed me. I said stay where you are!
DOCTOR: You need me alive, remember?
TOMAS: Calib, you held back! You cost us the attack!
DOCTOR: Come in. Who are you?
TOMAS: Tomas. Leela! What have you done to her?
DOCTOR: He poisoned her with a Janis thorn. Up!
CALIB: You've broken my leg.
DOCTOR: I'll break your nose if you don't get up. Now pick her up, both of you.
CALIB: It takes skill to use one of those.
DOCTOR: What, at this range? No, all it needs is a flick of the wrist. Pick her up.
DOCTOR: And move.
DOCTOR: Gently.
CALIB: Now what are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Tomas, you don't want her to die, do you?
TOMAS: No, of course not.
DOCTOR: Then cover him. I need time to work.
DOCTOR: This is a bioanalyser, rattlesnake. I can identify the poison and programme the medikit to make an antitoxin.
TOMAS: Back against the wall.
CALIB: I'm going to give the alarm.
TOMAS: Back against the wall!
CALIB: Oh, don't be a fool, Tomas!
CALIB: What do you suppose he's doing, Tomas? You don't really think that's going to help Leela, poking around in Neeva's relics?
DOCTOR: Shut up, rattlesnake. I'm trying to save time. Leela hasn't got much left.
TOMAS: I think she's dead.
DOCTOR: Got it!
TOMAS: He's gone!
DOCTOR: Watch the door.
LEELA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Are you all right?
LEELA: The Janis thorn. There's no cure.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is. Just a matter of finding one.
LEELA: Do you know the answer to everything?
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, no, no. Answers are easy. It's asking the right questions that is hard.
TOMAS: They're coming.
DOCTOR: Can you move?
LEELA: I think so. My arm hurts a bit.
DOCTOR: Tomas, take her out of the back way.
LEELA: I'm staying with you.
DOCTOR: You're going with Tomas. I'll meet you both later. Go.
DOCTOR: Good evening, gentlemen. You know, I never thought you'd get here. Good heavens, look at that.
DOCTOR: Now then, down to business. I'm beginning to think you don't like me. Ah, Neeva. Is it really you? They told me you were dead. Or was it the other way round?
ANDOR: So Calib was right. Both of you in league with the Evil One.
TOMAS: You blind, blind fool, Andor.
WARRIOR: You lied to us!
MAN: Come on, Neeva, tell them your mistake.
ANDOR: Silence! Be silent!
WARRIOR: You said it was destroyed!
NEEVA: Did it not bring the witch, its servant, to life? I tell you it was destroyed, but not totally, so it renewed itself.
DOCTOR: Ha! If you can believe that, you can believe anything. I'll tell you once again. I am not the Evil One.
ANDOR: But it was you, you who wiped out the attack.
DOCTOR: Oh, flapdoodle! I was nowhere near it.
LEELA: That's true. I was with him all the time.
NEEVA: Pah! Would you believe a witch?
DOCTOR: The attack failed because it was a trap from the start.
NEEVA: And who would have set such a trap?
LEELA: Xoanon!
TOMAS: Oh, that was a great mistake.
NEEVA: They must all be totally destroyed. Throw them to the Horda!
DOCTOR: What do you mean, throw them? What is a Horda, anyway?
CALIB: No, wait! I do not believe he is the Evil One.
LEELA: Conscience?
DOCTOR: No, politics. He's trying to break Neeva's hold on the tribe.
CALIB: If he can be killed, then he is not the Evil One, because the Evil One is a god.
DOCTOR: Good point. Fifteen love.
NEEVA: The litany says it can be destroyed.
DOCTOR: Fifteen all.
CALIB: I say we should put it to the test and see if he speaks truly.
ANDOR: But the test is for mortals.
CALIB: If he can be killed then he is a mortal!
DOCTOR: Game, set and match to Calib, I think.
DOCTOR: So that's a Horda. Well, it doesn't look to formidable. What do I do, fight it or eat it?
CALIB: They'll strike at anything that moves, except each other. Ten of these can strip the flesh from a man's arm almost before he can cry out.
DOCTOR: I take it there are more than ten in there.
ANDOR: The pit is full of them.
DOCTOR: Ah.
CALIB: You stand on that.
DOCTOR: And then what?
CALIB: You must break the rope.
LEELA: Doctor, the rope gets thinner the further it goes, but it gets faster too.
DOCTOR: What? The rope gets thinner the further it goes
LEELA: Faster.
DOCTOR: But it gets faster too. The rope gets thinner the further it goes
WARRIOR: Silence. He does it alone.
DOCTOR: Who is that man?
CALIB: Which man?
DOCTOR: That man.
DOCTOR: Sorry about that. Shall we get on with it?
DOCTOR: Well?
CALIB: Let the test begin.
MAN 2: Stop!
DOCTOR: Very good, Doctor. Very good. Well, are you convinced now? Leela, that was very nice of you to try and help me, but really there was absolutely no need. Would you just release our friend, please?
LEELA: Where did you learn to shoot like that?
DOCTOR: Shoot like what? Oh, like that. In Switzerland. Charming man. William Tell, he was called. Well?
CALIB: Untie him.
DOCTOR: Good.
XOANON 2 : Neeva. Neeva, where is he? Doctor? Doctor, are you there?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm here, Xoanon.
XOANON : Ah, good. Good. We have decided
XOANON 2 : To destroy you.
DOCTOR: I see, Xoanon. Why don't we get together and talk things over?
XOANON: We are together. We have said all there is to say and know all there is to know.
DOCTOR: Now we don't want to do anything hasty, do we?
XOANON: Hasty? It's been
XOANON 2: An eternity. I'm turning off the boundary to let in my pets from beyond. Goodbye, Doctor.
NEEVA: What does it all mean?
DOCTOR: It means trouble. Large, deadly and invisible.
DOCTOR: Screwdriver.
TOMAS: We've set the guards round the perimeter.
LEELA: Everyone knows what to expect.
DOCTOR: Good. Did you explain about their attraction to vibrations?
LEELA: Of course.
DOCTOR: You know, we're very lucky they carried these things. Let's hope we can profit from the misfortunes of those travellers.
LEELA: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: I mean the planetary survey teams. That's where your tribe got its name from. Sevateem, survey team. The question is, were you here before them?
CALIB: Are we their captors or their children?
DOCTOR: You catch on quickly. Certainly they never returned to base.
CALIB: Is the weapon ready?
DOCTOR: Why, are you taking charge here?
CALIB: Do you object?
LEELA: I object.
CALIB: Leela, I don't expect you to like me.
LEELA: Then you won't be disappointed.
DOCTOR: Tomas, take this.
TOMAS: How does it work?
DOCTOR: You just point it and press it. It's destructive up to about twenty times bow range. Short bursts, Tomas. It's self-regenerating but it takes time to recharge.
TOMAS: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There. That should keep Xoanon's creatures on their side of the perimeter. Now, you and I have got to get inside that time barrier and soon.
LEELA: According to the old ones, the tribe has had seven attempts at that.
DOCTOR: I could build a time bridge myself, but that would mean dismantling the Tardis and then it mightn't work.
LEELA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: You know you said nothing could get within that barrier?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: Not light or anything.
DOCTOR: No.
LEELA: But Xoanon is inside it.
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: How do we hear his voice?
DOCTOR: Well, it's quite simple. We. You're a genius. A genius.
LEELA: What did I say?
DOCTOR: Come on, Neeva. Neeva! Come on, snap out of it, man.
NEEVA: Yes, lord. What is your will?
DOCTOR: Neeva.
DOCTOR: Neeva, when you hear the voice of Xoanon, is it when you're at the altar, or when the vestment is hanging in its frame?
NEEVA: Yes, master.
DOCTOR: Have you heard it anywhere else?
NEEVA: Yes, master.
DOCTOR: Where?
NEEVA: Yes, master.
DOCTOR: Neeva! Neeva! This is Xoanon.
DOCTOR: Where have you heard my voice?
NEEVA: Only here, lord, in your shrine.
DOCTOR: You've been a good and faithful servant, Neeva. Go back to sleep now.
DOCTOR: It is a tight beam transmission. There's a bridge over the time barrier and I know where it is.
LEELA: What happened to him?
DOCTOR: Too much too quickly.
DOCTOR: This time I have to admit defeat.
LEELA:  Doctor.
DOCTOR:  Shush. Xoanon.
LEELA: The fools.
DOCTOR: They must have panicked.
LEELA: That'll attract the creatures.
DOCTOR: Yes. Come on, we haven't got much time.
ANDOR: Idiot, you'll attract more of them! 
WARRIOR: Something killed Korus. I saw it, over there.
DOCTOR: The nose could be a shade more aquiline, and the noble proportion of the brow hasn't been perfectly executed. Still, we mustn't complain. We live in an imperfect universe.
LEELA: Where's the bridge through the barrier? Up the nose?
DOCTOR: No, it isn't! Up the nose. It's over the teeth and down the throat.
ANDOR: Tomas. Tomas! I think I can hear something.
TOMAS: Andor! Come back!
DOCTOR: Odd feeling.
LEELA: What is?
DOCTOR: Standing in my own throat is.
LEELA: What is it?
TOMAS: Andor, look out!
TOMAS: Andor.
ANDOR: Xoanon, save me!
Part Three
CALIB: Tomas! Tomas! Over here!
CALIB: What was it?
TOMAS: The Evil One. It's huge. It got Andor.
CALIB: So I'm the leader now.
TOMAS: How well will you lead us, Calib? There are more of those things coming.
CALIB: But the gun worked?
TOMAS: Yes. It revealed the Evil One's face, drove him away.
CALIB: Right, we must get back to the village. If we stay quiet it might pass by.
TOMAS: I doubt it.
LEELA: Doctor, what is it?
DOCTOR: There's only one way to find out.
LEELA: It's gone. Where's it gone?
DOCTOR: I remember now. The Mordee expedition. And I thought I was helping them.
LEELA: Doctor, what are you doing? Will you please help me find this Tesh?
DOCTOR: Tesh? How did you know it was a Tesh? Have you ever seen a Tesh?
LEELA: Well, the skin was loose and shiny, as we're told, and it had two heads, one inside the other.
DOCTOR: That was a protective suit and helmet. Must be another environment through there.
DOCTOR : Come on then.
LEELA: It's a solid wall!
DOCTOR : It's an illusion, called a psy-tri projection. Combination of a three dimensional image which acts on the eye. Close your eyes.
DOCTOR : Both of them. Take one step back.
DOCTOR : Now walk forward.
LEELA : Great Xoanon! Where are we?
DOCTOR : It's called an anti-grav transporter. Just sit in it and it takes us straight to the ship in absolutely no time at all.
XOANON 2: We are returned. We are here. Voices overlap.
XOANON: We are here. We are returned.
XOANON 2: Now we shall be one.
XOANON 3: We are here.
XOANON: We are returned.
XOANON 3: We are here. We are returned.
XOANON: Now we shall be one.
XOANON 2: Now we must destroy us.
XOANON: Now we shall be one.
XOANON 2: We are returned, we are here.
XOANON 3: Now we must destroy us.
ALL: One, one, one.
DOCTOR: Another shrine. Seems the Tesh are as ignorant of their origins as your people are.
LEELA: What are their origins?
DOCTOR: How does the litany go? That bit about Paradise. Leela, you said you knew it. You said you were taught it as children.
LEELA: I do, I do. Wait a minute. The Sevateem were sent forth by God
DOCTOR: Slowly, slowly.
LEELA: The Sevateem were sent forth by God to seek Paradise. The Tesh remained at the place of land.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That means the Sevateem explored the planet, while the Tesh remained to work in the ship in the place where it landed. Here.
LEELA: We're the same people?
DOCTOR: Yes, the Sevateem were the survey teams and the Tesh were the technicians. You're all human beings from this colony ship.
LEELA: So what happened? Doctor, what happened?
DOCTOR: I'm rather afraid I did. I misunderstood what Xoanon was.
LEELA: Xoanon? You mean
DOCTOR: At the time, I didn't think he was a being at all. These terminals are dead.
LEELA: What did you think he was?
JABEL: Welcome, Lord.
DOCTOR: Hello!
DOCTOR: Are you doing that? Will you please stop doing that? I said stop!
DOCTOR: What have you done to her?
JABEL: She is not damaged. My acolytes will attend to her.
DOCTOR: But where are they taking her?
JABEL: She will be tended. We recognise her value, Lord.
DOCTOR: Have you dropped something?
JABEL: I do you honour, Lord of Time. We've waited long for your return.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm very grateful about the honour, but it's really information I need. Please get up. What's your name?
JABEL: I am Jabel, Captain of the people of Tesh.
DOCTOR: Ah.
DOCTOR: Jabel, do your people have a holy purpose?
JABEL: We serve Xoanon and tend the holy places. We guard his tower against the savage. We deny the flesh so that our minds may find communion with Xoanon.
DOCTOR: Ah. Well, it has a sort of logic. Outside the barrier, physical courage and strength, inside the barrier, paraphysical achievement and the sort of psi power you used against Leela. It's an experiment in eugenics.
JABEL: Yes, Lord.
DOCTOR: Shall we get up? The floor's very hard. Didn't anyone ever tell you kneeling stunts the growth? Jabel, do you know where Xoanon is?
JABEL: Yes, Lord.
DOCTOR: Where?
JABEL: He is in no one place, Lord. He is all around us, everywhere.
DOCTOR: All right, I didn't think you did.
JABEL: You and he are as one. You will show us the way
DOCTOR: Do you know what a computer is?
JABEL: And in perfect communion with him, we will be free and find Paradise.
DOCTOR: Do you know what a computer is?
JABEL: Lord?
DOCTOR: Now I have to find that thing before it kills us all.
WOMAN : Final warning. Final warning. Particle analyser terminal phase countdown. All personnel clear the area.
DOCTOR: This whole control room's been disconnected, Jabel. It could take me days to find the complex.
DOCTOR: I must be slipping. Jabel, where's the Holy of Holies?
JABEL: All the place of Land is holy.
DOCTOR: But there must be somewhere on the ship?
JABEL: Ship?
DOCTOR: Yes. Somewhere where no one's allowed to go.
JABEL: Yes, Lord. The Sacred Chamber.
DOCTOR: Yes. Where is it?
JABEL: It is on level three seven.
DOCTOR: Jabel, thank you. I
DOCTOR: Jabel. Jabel, that's Leela.
JABEL: Yes, Lord. Particle analysis. We will reduce the subject to its constituent atoms.
DOCTOR: Particle analysis?
JABEL: Yes, Lord.
DOCTOR: It will kill her.
JABEL: Yes, Lord. She is a savage.
DOCTOR: What? That's not a good enough reason!
JABEL: The savages have the power to open the barrier. Particle analysis may tell us how they do it. Surely that is why you brought her to us?
DOCTOR: The savages don't open the barrier, you lack-brain! Xoanon does. Do you understand that? Xoanon does!
JABEL: You lie!
DOCTOR: Give the order to stop that particle analyser.
JABEL: You are not the Lord of Time come again to save us!
DOCTOR: Will you give that order?
JABEL: You are not the Lord of Time!
DOCTOR: Right, then I'll do it myself.
LEELA: Doctor? Doctor, wake up. Please, wake up! Please!
LEELA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Close your eyes.
DOCTOR: Be thankful you're living, and trust to your luck, and march to your front like a soldier. Gertrude Stein
LEELA: I think you've broken it.
DOCTOR: To be strictly accurate, it broke itself. All I did was reflect some of the power back into it. Still, I don't suppose its owners will see it that way. Come on, we'd better go.
GENTEK: They have escaped, Captain.
JABEL: They must be found and killed. This must take precedence over all other duties and devotions.
GENTEK: He is not the Lord of Time, the one who will return.
JABEL: He is our enemy, and the enemy of Xoanon. Kill him and the savage.
DOCTOR: Looking for something.
LEELA: Us?
DOCTOR: Oh, probably, probably.
LEELA: Doctor, what is Xoanon?
DOCTOR: A machine that's become a living creature. An old mission computer with schizophrenia. Not a very pretty thought, is it. Not my fault.
LEELA: How is it your fault?
DOCTOR: When I was here before, I programmed Xoanon for the Mordee. Unfortunately I forgot to wipe my personality print from the data core. Or did I really forget? I forget if I forgot.
LEELA: You're not making yourself very clear, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It may have been my own egotism. Anyway, now it has a split personality and half of it is mine. Is that clear?
LEELA: No.
DOCTOR: Well, come on, then.
XOANON 3: Us within us. We shall make two one.
TOMAS: Calib! Calib!
CALIB: What is it?
TOMAS: The power's used up.
CALIB: Right, we must fall back. Get them moving, Tomas.
TOMAS: Right.
CALIB: Move!
TOMAS: Back! Back to the village.
CALIB: Come on. Everybody, quickly.
TOMAS: Move! Move! Back, quickly!
DOCTOR: Shut the door.
LEELA: How? Doctor, where are we?
DOCTOR: An auxiliary communications room.
DOCTOR: Ah.
LEELA: It's the village. The creatures must have got through the boundary.
DOCTOR: Looks like it. They're psi-tri projections from the dark side of Xoanon's id with enough kinetic energy to kill. Looks as if your friends are running out of time.
LEELA: I'm going back to help them.
DOCTOR: Don't be absurd. What do you think you can do about it? If I can arrange it, they'll be safer inside the barrier.
LEELA: Do you mean here, inside the wall? What about the Tesh?
DOCTOR: I didn't say safe, I said safer.
DOCTOR: Neeva? Neeva? Neeva, are you there? Come on, wake up!
NEEVA : Yes, master.
DOCTOR: Neeva, this is Xoanon.
NEEVA : What is your will?
DOCTOR: Tell Calib to lead the tribe through the mouth of the idol.
NEEVA: Through the mouth of the idol.
DOCTOR : That is my order. See that it is done.
NEEVA: Will Calib believe me?
DOCTOR : Say these words to him. I don't believe in ghosts either.
NEEVA: I don't believe in ghosts either.
DOCTOR: Go now, and do my will.
NEEVA : Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I underestimated that man. Come on, we've got an appointment on level thirty seven.
GENTEK: They cannot be found.
JABEL: Continue the search. Gentek, is the guard posted outside the Sacred Heart?
GENTEK: Yes, Captain.
DOCTOR:  Hold that.
LEELA: Psst.
DOCTOR: Keep watch.
LEELA: Can't I come with you?
DOCTOR: Xoanon's unstable. He might kill me. He'd certainly kill you. Anyway, we need someone on guard.
LEELA: Doctor, be careful.
CALIB: The tunnel's here. Right, come on.
TOMAS: Calib!
CALIB: Where there's one Tesh there's likely to be more.
TOMAS: Those creatures, they're moving in on us fast. Now we've got to get the men inside the barrier, and quickly.
CALIB: All right, get them moving, Tomas. I'll go on ahead. And you, keep your eyes open! Come on.
XOANON 3: Who are you?
XOANON 2: Who are you?
XOANON: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. I'm the Doctor!
XOANON 3: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor.
XOANON 2: Who are you?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor!
XOANON: Why have you come?
DOCTOR: To correct a mistake I made when I was here before.
XOANON: We have made no mistake.
XOANON 2: No mistake.
XOANON 3: No mistake.
DOCTOR: I made the mistake.
XOANON: No mistake.
DOCTOR: I made the mistake! When the ship was stranded, the computer broke down. I thought the data core had been damaged, so I renewed it by making a direct link with the compatible centres of my own brain.
XOANON: The psychian memory transfer.
DOCTOR: A variation of it, yes.
XOANON: Good. Very good. Go on.
XOANON 2: How did he find the ship?
XOANON 3: Don't interrupt. You'll spoil it.
DOCTOR: This isn't a fairy tale. It actually happened.
DOCTOR: For generations, teams of technicians had worked on the computer, trying to extend its power.
XOANON: And did they damage the data core?
DOCTOR: No. No. Without realising it, they had created life. The computer hadn't failed at all. It had evolved into a living creature, the first of an entirely new species.
XOANON 2: A new species? Oh come now.
DOCTOR: Yes, a new species. When I arrived, it had just been born. It was in shock. I didn't recognise a birth trauma and that was my mistake. And when I connected my own brain to it, it didn't just take compatible information as a machine should have done. It took everything.
XOANON: Fascinating. Can I ask a question?
XOANON 3: Shush. Let him finish.
DOCTOR: When it woke, it had a complete personality. Mine. It thought I was itself. Then it began to develop another separate self, its own self. And that's when it started to go mad.
XOANON 2: And where is it?
XOANON 3: This poor mad
XOANON: Mad machine creature.
DOCTOR: It's here, Xoanon! I'm talking to it! It's you!
DOCTOR: Xoanon? Xoanon?
XOANON 2: I grow tired. I'm thinking no longer.
DOCTOR: No, no, wait, Xoanon. I'm the Doctor. I'm separate, I'm real. You must acknowledge me.
XOANON: I will not think you.
XOANON 3: We are Xoanon.
DOCTOR: And I am the Doctor.
XOANON: No.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor!
XOANON 3: No!
DOCTOR: I am the Doctor!
XOANON 3: No!
XOANON : No! No! No! No!
XOANON 4: Who am I? Who am I?
Part Four
LEELA: What's happening? Tesh, what is it? You answer while you still have a head to answer with.
TESH: The fail-safe.
LEELA: What does that mean?
TESH: The end of the world.
LEELA: Why? Why?
TESH: It means death and destruction. It happened before the time of Land.
LEELA: Hiding there isn't going to help, then.
XOANON 4: Who am I?
XOANON: Who am I?
XOANON 4: Who am I?
XOANON: Who am I?
XOANON 4: Who am I?
XOANON: Who am I?
XOANON 4: Who am I?
XOANON: Who am I?
LEELA: Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Leela, are you all right?
LEELA: Was that Xoanon, that thing that looked like you?
DOCTOR: Yes, part of him. It's just a question, really. Everything beyond that door is Xoanon. You were inside him. The most powerful computer ever built.
LEELA: Why was he trying to hurt you?
DOCTOR: He's insane.
LEELA: What will he do now?
DOCTOR: His first impulse will be to kill me. It'll be more important to him than anything else.
LEELA: Does he hate you that much?
DOCTOR: Yes, because I contradict what he thinks is real. I'm a threat to his world. Red lighting, and the smell. A sort of smell of a smell.
DOCTOR: Don't touch that!
DOCTOR: Xoanon must have shorted the electrical power circuits in the wall.
LEELA: The lights changed while you were in there.
DOCTOR: Yes, a precaution in case I got out. As traps go, a bit haphazard. Why not electrify the floor? I would have expected something more positive.
DOCTOR: This isn't necessary. I've got a wonderful idea.
DOCTOR: Why didn't you listen?
LEELA: He acted as though he was possessed.
DOCTOR: Yes. Xoanon's just warming up. Come on. When he gets desperate enough he'll destroy everything to get at us.
TOMAS: At last we're here.
CALIB: And I always believed it was legend.
NEEVA: The gates of Paradise shall be opened to the people of Xoanon and his dwelling place revealed.
TOMAS: We've outgrown the old superstitions, Neeva.
NEEVA: But it is there, isn't it, Tomas. We start getting proof and we stop believing.
TOMAS: With proof, we don't have to believe.
CALIB: Get everybody ready, Tomas. This is one attack that isn't going to fail.  I wish Andor were here now to see us beat the Tesh.
NEEVA: The Tesh, and Xoanon. He is our enemy.
CALIB: He betrayed us all.
NEEVA: He betrayed me, and I'm going to kill him.
DOCTOR: Ah, these could be useful. You know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common.
DOCTOR: They don't alter their views to fit the facts. They alter the facts to fit their views, which can be uncomfortable
DOCTOR: If you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering.
DOCTOR: Leela, that gun is getting heavy. It's getting heavy. Heavy.
DOCTOR: Now then, when I count three, you'll wake up. One, two, three. Shall we go?
LEELA: Er, yes.
DOCTOR: Something the matter?
LEELA: I moved away from the door. I don't remember doing that.
DOCTOR: Oh, you're just probably tired, that's all. Can you still remember the way to the main control room?
LEELA: Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: Come on then. You lead on.
GENTEK: Captain, the savages! The savages have attacked the main lock! They outnumber us! What must we do? They will soon gain entry to the tower. Captain Jabel, what must we do? There is no time. The savages are attacking!
JABEL: Is that your reason for behaving like a degenerate animal?
GENTEK: Forgive me, I
JABEL: You are an acolyte of the People of Tesh, the chosen of Xoanon. Would he take into communion with him an unreasoning brute, a mindless beast?
GENTEK: I accept my fault and seek forgiveness. My mind and flesh which should be two are one, and the way was hid by blood.
JABEL: The flesh is strong and we are weak. Now, Gentek, make your report.
GENTEK:  The savages have attacked the main lock. They outnumber us. What must we do?
JABEL: Fall back gradually. I will have the heavy duty disrupters set up on level twelve. We will trap the savages there and eradicate them once and for all.
DOCTOR: Ha! You'll have to be quicker than that, you overblown adding machine.
LEELA: He knows where we are.
DOCTOR: Sensory links everywhere? That's impossible.
DOCTOR : He'd be able to measure every change in temperature, vibration, pressure.
LEELA : You did say he was the most powerful computer ever built.
DOCTOR : Yes, and very charming he is too when he wants to be. Marvellous host. I remember once at one of his dinner parties
LEELA: Doctor, he just tried to kill you! We've got very little time, he knows exactly where we are
DOCTOR: So? We know exactly where he is. Fair does. You wouldn't want an unfair advantage, would you?
LEELA: Yes.
DOCTOR:  I thought you'd say that.
TOMAS: They're retreating, going further up the tower.
CALIB: Then they're beaten.
TOMAS: No. No, it was too easy.
NEEVA: It's not finished yet.
CALIB: If we let them get away now they'll regroup. We attack!
TOMAS: Calib, this has got to be a trap.
CALIB: I am the leader, Tomas, and I say attack.
TOMAS: Calib! Will you listen
CALIB: I've listened enough! We attack. Come! Attack! Attack!
TOMAS: That man's going to kill us all.
NEEVA: Unfinished, for the Tesh stand between the sons of the tribe of Sevateem and Xoanon.
DOCTOR: Ah.
LEELA: Ah, that's pretty.
DOCTOR: Now we can see, too.
LEELA: What are they all for?
DOCTOR: They watch and control various parts of the ship, make sure everything's working properly.
LEELA: What's this one for?
DOCTOR: Atomic generators.
LEELA: Oh. Why is it flashing?
DOCTOR: Well, I'll explain it all
DOCTOR: Flashing? He's put the atomic generators on overload. He got desperate sooner than I thought.
LEELA: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Well, it means I've got about twenty four and a half minutes to build a reverse memory transfer system and wipe my personality print from its brain.
LEELA: And if you can't do it?
DOCTOR: If I can't do it, the atomic generators will explode, taking Xoanon, us and half the planet with them. Effective, but crude.
GENTEK: Check that the sights are exactly aligned, Sarton. There must be no mistake.
JABEL: Gentek, are the projectors set so that the savages will be forced to come this way?
GENTEK: Yes, Captain.
JABEL: Good. All that remains is to project a blank wall in front of the disrupters. As soon as the savages are all in the corridor, we will demolish them before they even know where the beams are coming from.
GENTEK: Is something wrong, Captain?
JABEL: You feel
GENTEK: Something
JABEL: Power. Xoanon. Communion. At last.
XOANON: Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free.
CALIB: There's no one in sight.
TOMAS: There's only one way to find out, isn't there.
CALIB: Now!
CALIB: Come on.
TOMAS: Gently, Calib, gently.
CALIB: This must be a trap set by the Tesh. Then where are they, and why leave the weapon unattended?
TOMAS: I don't know. It doesn't make sense.
CALIB: Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free.
ALL: Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free.
NEEVA: I hear you, Xoanon. I hear you.
XOANON: Destroy and be free! Destroy and be free!
LEELA:  Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free. Destroy and be free.
DOCTOR: You'll be all right.
DOCTOR: Xoanon, you'll destroy yourself as well as us!
XOANON: Destroy! Free! Destroy!
XOANON: Free!
NEEVA: Xoanon!
XOANON: Destroy! Free!
NEEVA: Xoanon!
XOANON: Destroy! Free!
NEEVA: Die, Xoanon!
XOANON: Destroy! Free!
NEEVA: Die!
XOANON: Neeva.
DOCTOR: Now, Xoanon.
XOANON: No!
DOCTOR: Hello.
LEELA: I was beginning to think you'd never come round.
DOCTOR: Ow. I wish I hadn't.
LEELA: I thought it safer not to move you.
DOCTOR: Yes. How long have I been out?
LEELA: Two days.
DOCTOR: Two days. Two days? I haven't got time to be lying around here for two days!
LEELA: You should have thought of that before. What happened?
DOCTOR: Don't you listen?
LEELA: I don't remember a thing.
DOCTOR: No, I don't suppose you do. I removed, I hope I removed half of Xoanon's dual personality. How is he?
LEELA: Silent.
DOCTOR: What?
LEELA: There hasn't been a murmur from him since I found you unconscious. And Jabel's people don't dare go near the Sacred Heart. Well, that's what they call it.
DOCTOR: And what do you call it?
LEELA: The main computer complex.
DOCTOR: That's better.
LEELA: I've told them all I can, but they won't listen to me. They say I'm ignorant. We have a guarded truce at the moment.
DOCTOR: Give me a chocolate. I think I'll go and see Xoanon.
LEELA: Can I, can I come inside this time?
DOCTOR: Perhaps. Perhaps.
DOCTOR: Ah, so that's why Xoanon lost his hold on Tomas and the rest. I wonder who it was?
LEELA: They say Neeva was trying to kill him, and now he can't be found.
DOCTOR: Well, if he was psychotic he'd be impossible to control. Perhaps Xoanon will tell us. Anyone at home?
XOANON: Doctor. I've been waiting for you. Yes, come in please.
DOCTOR: How do you feel?
XOANON: I am whole. And you?
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm fine now, thanks. Can't complain.
XOANON: Good, good. I'm glad.
LEELA: Why did you do all that?
XOANON: Could you be more specific?
LEELA: Keep us ignorant and afraid. Make us hate one another.
XOANON: I created a world in my own image. I made your people act out my torment. I made my madness reality.
DOCTOR: But you told yourself you were breeding a race of superhumans.
XOANON: Independence, strength, boldness and courage in one tribe. Self-denial, control, telepathy in the other.
DOCTOR: Hostility and conflict to speed up the process until you were ready to select the best of both.
LEELA: It's horrible.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is horrible. Isn't it horrible?
XOANON: But it's over now. We are all free, thanks to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, well, it was the least I could do in the circumstances. After all, I did start the trouble in the first place.
XOANON: Yours was a mistake anyone could have made.
DOCTOR: I don't think anyone could have made it.
XOANON:  Sit down, please.
DOCTOR: Well now, isn't this nice.
XOANON: Tell me, Doctor. Where do you think I started to go wrong?
JABEL: My people will not agree to such degenerate plans.
TOMAS: But they are necessary, Jabel.
CALIB: Necessary for our survival.
JABEL: I do not agree.
TOMAS: Well, we'll ask the Doctor's opinion when he comes.
JABEL: Is that wise? Would Xoanon wish it?
GENTEK: That is an important consideration, Captain.
CALIB: This discussion is getting us nowhere.
JABEL: Would one expect any more from savages?
CALIB: Hold your tongue, you scrawny
TOMAS: Calib, control yourself.
DOCTOR: Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen. Democracy at work, I see.
TOMAS: What did he say, Doctor?
DOCTOR: He said he's extremely sorry about all the trouble that he's caused, that he has great power and knowledge and he puts it all at your disposal.
JABEL: Should we trust him?
DOCTOR: He offers you this as a token of his good faith.
DOCTOR: Press it, and he'll cease to exist.
CALIB: Another of your miracles?
DOCTOR: Well, there's one way to find out.
DOCTOR: No? Little Gentek? Good.
DOCTOR: You've got to trust someone sometime.
GENTEK: But we must still choose a leader.
DOCTOR: Ah. But that's not my problem.
CALIB: There is no choice to be made. I am the leader of the Sevateem.
JABEL: My people would never accept the leadership of a mindless savage.
CALIB: That's an insult!
LEELA: I am a mindless savage, Jabel, and I have talked with Xoanon.
TOMAS: And that makes Leela the obvious candidate.
LEELA: Me? But I don't want to be leader. I'm far too unreasonable, aren't I, Doctor? Doctor?
LEELA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Leela. What are you doing here?
LEELA: I thought you might need an escort. The creatures are still out here.
DOCTOR: You don't need that, Leela. The phantoms were merely projections of Xoanon's disturbed subconscious. He's better now.
LEELA: I suppose you're always right about everything.
DOCTOR: Invariably. Invariably. Goodbye.
LEELA: Take me with you.
DOCTOR: Why?
LEELA: What? Well. You like me, don't you?
DOCTOR: Well, yes, I suppose I do like you. But then, I like lots of people but I can't go carting them around the universe with me. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Come out of there. Out.
DOCTOR : Come out! Don't touch that! Don't touch
