The Androids of Tara
Part One
DOCTOR: Rook to bishop's four.
DOCTOR: I saw Capablanca make that move against Alekhine in 1927.
K9: He lost, master.
DOCTOR: Who?
K9: Capablanca.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
K9: Master, I have been programmed with all the Championship games since 1866. Capablanca lost.
DOCTOR: I must have been called away. Are you really sure?
K9: King to knight's two.
DOCTOR: King to knight's two. King? That's a terrible move. You've weakened the king's side.
K9: Clock, master.
DOCTOR: I know, I know. I'll check your programming sometime. We're not supposed to be playing draughts, you know.
K9: Master.
ROMANA: What are you doing, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Shush. We're playing chess.
ROMANA: Yes, I can see that, but aren't you forgetting something?
DOCTOR: I don't think so.
ROMANA: What about our task? The Key to Time, remember?
DOCTOR: Oh, that old thing.
ROMANA: Yes, that old thing. The Guardian did stress the need for urgency, didn't he?
DOCTOR: Shush.
ROMANA: I'll do it.
DOCTOR: If you must.
DOCTOR: I just feel I deserve a little break. After all, we've got half the segments. I prefer to play chess.
ROMANA: Really. Materialisation in fifteen seconds. Mate in twelve.
K9: Correction, mistress. Eleven.
ROMANA: Eleven? Oh yes. Sorry, K9.
K9: Apologies are unnecessary, mistress.
DOCTOR: Mate in eleven? Oh yes, oh yes. Well, that's the trouble with chess, isn't it. It's all so predictable.
ROMANA: Materialisation commencing now. Five, four, three, two, one.
ROMANA: Was that smooth enough for you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ROMANA: I said, was that smooth enough?
DOCTOR: Mate in eleven? What, have we arrived? Oh good. Where?
ROMANA: Tara.
DOCTOR: Tara?
ROMANA: Earth-type gravity, oxygen atmosphere, climate, temperate.
DOCTOR: Ah. Peaceful looking place. That shouldn't give you too much trouble.
ROMANA: Me?
DOCTOR: I think it's rather beautiful, don't you? Very good for. Yes, I think it would be.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: Shouldn't you be getting changed?
ROMANA: Oh yes, all right.
ROMANA: Tara, Tara. Tahiti?
ROMANA: No. Tally ho. Tara!
ROMANA : What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Well, it's in here somewhere.
ROMANA : I said, what are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Aha! Aha! Goody. Gosh, that takes me back.
DOCTOR: Or forward. That's the trouble with time travel, you can never remember.
ROMANA : What is it?
DOCTOR: Last time I used this, I was with Isaak Walton. Yes. Yes, it's all here.
ROMANA: Well, how do you like it? Good. According to our records, it's what everyone on Tara's wearing this year. Isn't that right, K9?
K9: Affirmative.
ROMANA: Aha.
DOCTOR: Aha.
ROMANA: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Fishing.
ROMANA: Fishing? What's fishing?
DOCTOR: Fishing? It's an art, worthy of the knowledge and practise of a wise man. Isaak Walton
ROMANA: Look, we haven't got time for you to practise anything. We've got to find the fourth segment.
DOCTOR: You find it. I'm taking the day off.
ROMANA: The day off?
DOCTOR: Yes. After a journey of four hundred years and twelve parsecs, I'm allowed a rest of fifty years.
ROMANA: Where does it say that?
DOCTOR: Section ninety three, paragraph two, laws governing Time Lords. You look it up. Go on.
ROMANA: What? You just made that up.
ROMANA: But you can't just spent the fifty years fishing.
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. I'd get bored. I just propose to spend the next couple of hours fishing.
ROMANA: But what about the fourth segment?
DOCTOR: You get it.
ROMANA: Right, I will.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do that. It's a lovely day, beautiful countryside. The walk will do you good.
ROMANA: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Would you just mind standing aside, please? You're casting a shadow. It frightens the fish.
ROMANA: Frightens the fish. Look, I'm going to get that fourth segment and I'll be back here in under an hour. You be ready to leave.
DOCTOR: Yes.
GRENDEL: Here, beast!
GRENDEL: It's incredible!
ROMANA: I don't know how to thank you. If you hadn't have come along when you did, that beast would have got me. What's your name?
GRENDEL: My name? Er, you're not damaged in any way?
ROMANA: No, no, I just stumbled slightly, that's all.
GRENDEL: Your head isn't injured?
ROMANA: No, I don't think so. There's no harm done. I'm sorry if you're somebody frightfully important, but I'm a stranger here, you see. My name's Romana.
GRENDEL: Ah, the fair Romana. That's a pretty name.
ROMANA: Thank you. Tell me, are there many creatures like that around here? I understood that the fauna of Tara were supposed to be friendly.
GRENDEL: I always keep some beasts in my woods to hunt, but they don't usually attack people unless they're frightened in some way.
ROMANA: Your woods?
GRENDEL: Yes. These are part of the estates of Gracht. What a curiously shaped stone.
ROMANA: Yes.
GRENDEL: Oh, have you hurt your ankle?
ROMANA: No, no, it's nothing, really. Could I have my stone, please?
GRENDEL: Of course, as soon as its been registered.
ROMANA: Registered?
GRENDEL: Yes. Do you not know the law?
ROMANA: No. As I said, I'm a stranger here.
GRENDEL: The law decrees that all minerals, particularly unusual ones like of this kind, must be registered with the Knight of Castle Gracht.
ROMANA: Who's that?
GRENDEL: Me. I am Count Grendel, Knight of Gracht, Master of the Sword.
ROMANA: Oh, I see.
GRENDEL: What's happened to the statue?
ROMANA: Is it important?
GRENDEL: Only to superstitious fools.
ROMANA: Oh?
GRENDEL: It's our family emblem. At least, it was. It's supposed to guard our fortunes. How very odd.
ROMANA: Look, I'm sorry, but I really must
GRENDEL: It's of no importance. What is important is to get that ankle of your attended to.
ROMANA: It's nothing, really.
GRENDEL: I shall take you to my castle. My steward can register your stone while my surgeon attends to your injury.
ROMANA: Look, it's very kind of you, but I really couldn't
GRENDEL: Then I shall provide you with a mount and an escort to take you wherever you wish.
ROMANA: It's just a question of time.
GRENDEL: An hour, no more. What's an hour out of your life?
GRENDEL: I shall not take no for an answer.
ROMANA: What's that? Is it yours?
GRENDEL: My favourite charger. Strong as a tree and swift as the wind.
ROMANA: Well, how does it go? What makes it work?
GRENDEL: Good heavens, I don't know, my dear.
ROMANA: You don't?
GRENDEL: I'm a knight, not a farrier.
DOCTOR: Do you mind not standing on my chest? My hat's on fire. I don't think we've met before.
ZADEK: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ZADEK: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Call me Doctor.
ZADEK: What are you doing here?
DOCTOR: Oh, fishing.
ZADEK: This is Prince Reynart's hunting estate.
DOCTOR: What? Prince Reynart?
ZADEK: Yes.
DOCTOR: I've never heard of him. Decent sort of chap, is he?
FARRAH: Shall I kill him, Swordmaster?
DOCTOR: No, no, that won't be necessary.
DOCTOR: Good heavens, electrically charged. The control's in the hilt, I see.
ZADEK: You know about such things?
DOCTOR: Well, I've travelled.
FARRAH: He said he was a doctor.
ZADEK: You know about machines, electronics?
DOCTOR: A little.
ZADEK: You don't look like a peasant.
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. I've travelled.
ZADEK: But you have certain skills. Can you mend an android?
DOCTOR: What? What did you just say?
ZADEK: An android.
DOCTOR: I thought you said an android. What's wrong with it?
ZADEK: It won't go.
DOCTOR: Why don't you just try your local android dealer?
FARRAH: Shall I kill him now, Swordmaster?
DOCTOR: Look, that isn't necessary. You see, I'd really love to help you out but I'm frightfully busy and where is this android?
GRENDEL: There is Castle Gracht, my dear.
ROMANA: It's beautiful.
GRENDEL: It's the ancient home of the Grendels of Gracht. And it's quite, quite escape-proof, I'm glad to say.
TILL: My lord is come! Open the gate!
GRENDEL: There, that wasn't too bad, was it?
ROMANA: There's no need to carry me. I can still walk.
TILL: Master.
GRENDEL: Fetch Madame Lamia.
TILL: Master.
GRENDEL: She's my surgeon. Come, my dear.
GRENDEL: There.
ROMANA: Oh, thank you. You won't forget to register my stone, will you?
GRENDEL: What?
ROMANA: My stone.
GRENDEL: Oh, no, no, of course not, my dear.
LAMIA: I got your message.
GRENDEL: Oh, Romana, my dear, this is Madame Lamia, my surgeon-engineer.
ROMANA: Hello. Engineer?
LAMIA: I don't believe it.
ROMANA: What's the matter?
LAMIA: It's incredible. It's a marvellous job. Who did it?
GRENDEL: The question is not so much who, my dear, as why.
LAMIA: I'm a peasant. I leave politics to my betters.
GRENDEL: Very wise of you, my dear.
ROMANA: Now look, I don't know what all this is about, but I must
GRENDEL: Restrain her.
LAMIA: What do you want me to do with her, my lord?
GRENDEL: Well, we can't have her running around the kingdom. Disassemble her. We can cannibalise her for parts.
ROMANA: What parts? Now, wait a minute.
GRENDEL: I should like to keep the head. You're right, it really is quite remarkable.
DOCTOR: Ahem, you're standing on my scarf.
FARRAH: I'm terribly sorry.
DOCTOR: If you don't stop burning my scarf, you're going to have to kill me.
REYNART: Doctor, you must forgive Swordsman Farrah. He tends to get overenthusiastic in the pursuit of his duties.
DOCTOR: Perhaps he does
REYNART: But particularly in defence of his prince.
DOCTOR: Well, maybe he does get too enthusiastic in the course of his duty. What about my scarf?
ZADEK: Peasant, you will speak with respect when you address Prince Reynart of Tara.
DOCTOR: I told you, I'm not a peasant.
REYNART: But you do know about androids.
DOCTOR: Well, that depends.
ZADEK: On what?
REYNART: On how we treat him, obviously.
REYNART: So you're not a peasant.
DOCTOR: No.
REYNART: Very well, I'll make you an offer. One thousand gold pieces if you can mend our android.
DOCTOR: One thousand gold pieces? Pfft. Do you think you can buy me for money? Ha! Five hundred.
REYNART: Done.
DOCTOR: Suppose I can't mend the android?
ZADEK: Then we shall give you to Swordsman Farrah for sword practice.
REYNART: No, we won't, Zadek. This man is obviously a gentleman. If he can mend our android, we shall reward him. If he cannot, you have my word, Doctor, you will come to no harm. You may go free.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
REYNART: Wait. The android?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes. Where? Excuse me.
Reynart goes to the other side of the room and removes a blanket from a faceless android wearing similar clothes to Lamia.)
REYNART: There he is, Doctor.
GRENDEL: I always enjoy watching you work, my dear.
LAMIA: Thank you, my lord. I shall make the cut here.
GRENDEL: Excellent.
ROMANA: Count, far be it from me to query this lady's competency as a doctor, but where I come from you don't cut off the patient's head if you wish to cure their ankle!
LAMIA: Ankle?
GRENDEL: Yes, there was supposed to be something wrong with its ankle.
LAMIA: It's swollen.
ROMANA: Well, what did you expect?
LAMIA: Extraordinary. If I didn't know better, my lord.
LAMIA: She is not an android. 
GRENDEL: What?
LAMIA: She is real.
ROMANA: Brilliant.
GRENDEL: Well, you can keep your head, my dear. I may have a better use for it.
DOCTOR: That's not bad. I have seen better.
REYNART: Don't you sometimes wish, Zadek, that our fathers had permitted us to learn peasant skills?
ZADEK: No, your highness. If we'd have meant to have been peasants, we'd have been born peasants.
REYNART: Perhaps you're right, Zadek. Well, Doctor, can it be fixed?
DOCTOR: Well, that depends. Fixed for what?
REYNART: Zadek.
REYNART: For one thing, it must wear this.
DOCTOR: Why?
REYNART: Tomorrow, at the appropriate hour fixed by the astrologers, in the great Coronation room of the Palace of Tara, I am to be crowned King.
DOCTOR: Well, congratulations.
REYNART: They will be in order if I get there.
DOCTOR: Why? What's to stop you?
REYNART: Count Grendel of Gracht.
DOCTOR: What?
REYNART: He'll kill me if he needs to. After all, you can't crown a dead Prince. Grendel and his men will be watching every entrance to the palace to prevent my getting to the Coronation room at the ordained time.
DOCTOR: So?
REYNART: If I fail to appear at the right moment, I forfeit my right to the crown.
DOCTOR: Ah. And that's when Grendel of Gracht steps in?
REYNART: The only other contender for the throne is the Princess Strella, but she disappeared some time ago. Nobody knows where she is.
DOCTOR: Where does George come into all this?
ZADEK: There have been three attempts on his Highness's life already. The next one could be successful.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. Let them attack George here instead of the Prince.
REYNART: Precisely. We use George, the android copy of me to create a diversion, to distract their attention.
DOCTOR: And draw their fire.
REYNART: To draw their fire, while we slip past the guards into the Coronation room. What do you think, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, it has been done before.
LAMIA: I don't like it.
GRENDEL: I'm not asking you to like it, just do it.
LAMIA: Is it wise? Think of the risk.
GRENDEL: You question my commands?
LAMIA: No, my lord, of course not.
GRENDEL: Then do what I tell you or I shall have you flogged, and don't imagine that I won't.
LAMIA: Yes, my lord.
ROMANA: What are you doing? What? No! Please, no! Ah.
GEORGE: Congratulations, Doctor. Thank you. And now if you will forgive me, gentlemen, I must retire.
GEORGE: Goodnight, gentlemen.
REYNART: Excellent! Farrah, bring wine. Do you know, it's quite eerie seeing oneself walk and talk like that. I never thought I'd see that thing going again.
DOCTOR: Well, it'll do for now, but if I'd had the proper tools I could have done a much better job.
REYNART: It's good enough to fool Grendel and his men, don't you think so, Zadek?
ZADEK: I hope so, your Highness, for our sake.
REYNART: Oh, Zadek, always the pessimist. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: My pleasure.
REYNART: Zadek.
ZADEK: Five hundred gold pieces.
REYNART: You wouldn't be interested in permanent employment, would you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm otherwise engaged.
REYNART: Pity. Still, you will stay and drink a toast to our success for tomorrow, won't you?
DOCTOR: All right.
REYNART: One of our local wines. Modest, demure, but palatable. Join us, Farrah.
FARRAH: Thank you, your Highness.
DOCTOR: You look better without your helmet.
FARRAH: Cooler, anyway.
ZADEK: With your permission, your Highness. To the King.
DOCTOR: To the King.
FARRAH: To the King.
REYNART: Not yet. Tomorrow, perhaps, thanks to the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
FARRAH: To the Doctor.
REYNART: The Doctor.
FARRAH: Your Highness?
DOCTOR: Potent stuff.
Part Two
FARRAH: Wake up!
DOCTOR: So much for the local wine.
FARRAH: Wake up, you traitor!
DOCTOR: What?
FARRAH: Traitor!
DOCTOR: What?
FARRAH: I want you to be totally conscious when I kill you.
DOCTOR: Haven't you got anything better to do?
FARRAH: There's only one thing preventing me from running you through right now.
DOCTOR: What's that?
FARRAH: Where is he?
DOCTOR: I don't know what you're talking about.
ZADEK: That's enough, Farrah. Doctor, the Prince has gone.
DOCTOR: What? Where?
ZADEK: Vanished. He's been kidnapped.
DOCTOR: By whom?
FARRAH: Your master, Count Grendel, of course!
DOCTOR: But I don't even know who Count Grendel is!
ZADEK: I'm inclined to believe you, Doctor.
FARRAH: But Swordmaster
ZADEK: Why should he remain when the Prince has been taken? It doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: Well at least he didn't take the android.
ZADEK: They took the real Prince. What use is the copy?
DOCTOR: Well, that depends on what you're going to do.
ZADEK: What honour demands.
DOCTOR: And what's that?
ZADEK: Farrah and I will take our swords and do battle with the Count's men.
DOCTOR: What? What, just the two of you?
FARRAH: A swordsman does not fear death if he dies with honour.
DOCTOR: Then he's an idiot. Listen, let me see if I understand this. In order to be crowned King, the Prince must present himself in the Coronation room at a specific time, right?
ZADEK: Correct.
DOCTOR: Then you've got no problem. Excuse me.
DOCTOR: You take it to the Coronation room and get it crowned.
FARRAH: Crown an android King of Tara? Never!
DOCTOR: Would you rather crown Count Grendel of Gracht?
FARRAH: But an android. It's unthinkable.
ZADEK: In any case, Grendel's men will see that we don't get into the Coronation room.
DOCTOR: Well, I don't suppose the King was going to walk in through the front door, was he?
ZADEK: He had a plan.
DOCTOR: Ah. What?
ZADEK: There is a secret passage.
DOCTOR: Aha, I thought there might be something like that. How secret? Would Grendel know about it?
ZADEK: I hope not.
DOCTOR: So do I. Right, now listen. I'll do some more work on George, you get him to the Coronation room, get him crowned, and while he's ruling the country you two can find the real Prince. I mean, that's worth a try, isn't it?
ZADEK: Doctor, I see only two objections to your plan.
DOCTOR: Only two?
ZADEK: What if the android breaks down?
DOCTOR: Ah, well, I can't guarantee you anything, but if I had the proper tools
ZADEK: Second problem, security.
DOCTOR: Security? But only the three of us need even know of George's existence.
ZADEK: Precisely. Farrah I can trust.
DOCTOR: And by the time George is King, I'll be light years away.
ZADEK: No, Doctor. You'll be with the android at all times.
DOCTOR: Now look here, Zadek. I've got better things to do than meddle in the politics of your piffling little planet.
DOCTOR: On the other hand, I could be with the android at all times.
FARRAH: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Calling my dog.
FARRAH: I don't see any dog.
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. He hasn't arrived yet.
K9: Master.
ZADEK: Doctor? You've checked the android?
DOCTOR: Well, as far as I can without the proper tools.
ZADEK: Everything is functioning correctly?
DOCTOR: No. His micro-circuitry's not perfect and his power packs need a boost.
ZADEK: I have great confidence in you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm deeply touched.
ZADEK: But remember, either Farrah or myself will be with you at all times. Don't let us down.
DOCTOR: Don't draw that sword.
K9: You called, master?
ZADEK: What is that thing?
DOCTOR: That thing? That's my dog.
ZADEK: But it's a machine.
DOCTOR: Well, so is your Prince.
DOCTOR: Don't draw that sword!
DOCTOR: K9? K9?
DOCTOR: Look, I don't like to say I told you so, but I told you so. Do put it away, quickly. K9, where's Romana?
K9: She has not yet returned, master.
DOCTOR: What? Where is she?
K9: Insufficient data to formulate a reply. She's not within range of my sensors.
DOCTOR: But she was only meant to be gone an hour.
ZADEK: You've lost someone?
DOCTOR: Yes, my assistant. She was looking for something.
ZADEK: What?
DOCTOR: Oh, nothing important.
ZADEK: Where was she last seen?
DOCTOR: Where you picked me up yesterday.
FARRAH: Which way was she going?
DOCTOR: Up the hill.
FARRAH: Towards Count Grendel's lands.
ZADEK: I'm afraid, Doctor, that it sounds as though she might have fallen into the hands of the Count.
GRENDEL: So, the lovely lady wakes.
ROMANA: How long have I been unconscious?
GRENDEL: Twelve hours, my dear. I trust you slept well. Release her.
ROMANA: Twelve hours? Oh, no.
GRENDEL: Why, what's the matter, my dear?
ROMANA: Look, why don't you just let me go? I've no money and I'm not worth ransoming. Why did you bring me here?
GRENDEL: Do you think I'm a common bandit?
ROMANA: I'm not even Taran. What possible use can I be to you?
GRENDEL: I'll show you. Help her down.
GRENDEL: Come with me. I want you to see something.
 
GRENDEL: And how is our guest?
GUARD: She's well, my lord.
GRENDEL: Good. Let's see for ourselves.
GRENDEL: Take a look, my dear.
ROMANA: Oh! It's incredible!
GRENDEL: Yes, the resemblance is extraordinary, isn't it?
ROMANA: Is it an android?
GRENDEL: Good heavens, no, my dear. That's the Princess Strella. First Lady of Tara, a descendant of the Royal House, Mistress of the domains of Thorvald, Mortgarde and Freya. In fact, Tara's most eligible spinster, shortly to become, in rapid succession, my fianc�e, my bride, and then deceased. Yes, it will be a tragic accident. A flower blighted in its prime. And naturally, as her husband, I shall claim her estates and her position as second in line to the throne, as provided for under Taran law.
ROMANA: I see. But since you've already got a princess, what do you need me for?
GRENDEL: Well, the Princess does not entirely agree with my plan.
ROMANA: I can't say I'm wildly surprised.
GRENDEL: In fact, she quite refuses to cooperate.
ROMANA: Good for her. But I still don't see what all this has got to do with me.
GRENDEL: Don't you, my dear? I should have thought that was obvious. If she goes on refusing, I can marry you instead in front of the great assembly of the nobles of Tara, who won't know the difference.
ROMANA: What happens if I refuse, too?
GRENDEL: Oh, but you won't. Aren't I a lucky man to have two such beautiful women as my bride?
ROMANA: Apparently your staff doesn't agree.
GRENDEL: She's prejudiced, my dear, just because I once showed her a certain courtesy. That's the trouble with peasants these days. They don't know their place any more. Open!
REYNART: Why don't you kill me, Grendel, and get it over with.
GRENDEL: Never rush your pleasures, my dear Reynart. Besides, I've brought someone to see you. Meet his Royal Highness, Prince Reynart, first in line to the throne of Tara.
REYNART: Strella!
ROMANA: No, I'm not Strella. I just look like her. My name's Romana.
GRENDEL: You see, my dear Reynart, when I play for high stakes I like to hold all the cards.
ROMANA: You won't be holding this one much longer. He's ill. He's running a fever.
GRENDEL: That's why we brought him a permanent nurse for his bedside. Hold her, Kurster. Lamia.
REYNART: Let her go!
GRENDEL: Don't be so tediously heroic, my dear fellow. Not too tight, Lamia. We don't want to choke her.
LAMIA: She is secure, my lord.
GRENDEL: Good.
GRENDEL: You know, my dear Reynart, you ought to thank me.
REYNART: For what?
GRENDEL: For what? For finding you such a charming nurse. There. Take good care of our royal guest, my dear. Watch them, Kurster.
KURSTER: Yes, my lord.
GRENDEL: And now, my friend, I must go to your coronation. It's a pity you will miss it.
DOCTOR: Where is Count Grendel's castle?
ZADEK: About eight leagues from here.
DOCTOR: Eight leagues.
ZADEK: You're not thinking of going there alone?
DOCTOR: Well, where else might he have taken her if not there?
ZADEK: To Tara itself. He will want to make sure that no one else claims the throne.
DOCTOR: Right. K9, you take the castle. I'll go to Tara with George.
FARRAH: You're going to help us then?
DOCTOR: Well, of course. Anyway, we need Zadek to get us into the palace, right?
ZADEK: Correct, Doctor.
DOCTOR: K9, off you go. Find out if Romana's there and report straight back to me. Come on, off you go.
FARRAH: Doctor?
DOCTOR: What?
FARRAH: Is he a good hunting dog?
DOCTOR: Oh, well, if she's there, he'll find her.
FARRAH: There's not a lot of time left.
ZADEK: We're almost there. Wait here. I'll go ahead and scout.
DOCTOR: Good.
FARRAH: Be careful, Swordmaster. He's not as young as he used to be.
DOCTOR: Who is.
FARRAH: Are you all right, sir? How do you feel?  I can't talk to androids. Is he all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so.
FARRAH: He's not talking.
DOCTOR: Well, I've switched off his communication mechanism to conserve power.
FARRAH: He'll have to make a speech at his coronation.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, he'll make a speech. Don't worry. It won't be a long one, but he'll make a speech.
FARRAH: I don't know what it is about androids. I know it's silly. You know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Funny thing, some androids feel like that about humans.
ZADEK: I have found the place. Come.
ZADEK: It's one of Grendel's men.
FARRAH: I'll deal with him.
DOCTOR: Will he recover?
FARRAH: In a few hours.
DOCTOR: Good.
DOCTOR: It fires electronic bolts. How very quaint.
FARRAH: It's a peasant's weapon.
ZADEK: Come, there's no time to lose.
LAMIA: That's curious.
LAMIA: That's very odd.
K9: Mistress?
REYNART: So you're a friend of the Doctor?
ROMANA: Yes. Don't worry, he'll get us out of here.
REYNART: Huh. How? No one's ever escaped from the dungeons of Castle Gracht. Ow. How is it? Not good, eh?
ROMANA: Look, don't try and talk. Just conserve your strength.
REYNART: For what? I can't swim the moat with this, let alone take on the guard.
ROMANA: The Doctor'll find a way.
REYNART: Soon, I hope. I'd like to try and avoid giving Grendel the pleasure of dying in one of his foul dungeons.
REYNART: Peasants! How dare you lay hands on a lady.
DOCTOR: What were these tunnels built for?
ZADEK: They were plague tunnels built about two hundred years ago to allow the royal court to move in and out of the palace without having to pass through the contaminated city.
DOCTOR: Ah.
ZADEK: The great plague wiped out nine tenths of the population.
FARRAH: That's when the survivors started using androids to replace the people.
DOCTOR: I see. Very far yet?
ZADEK: Quite a way, I fear.
KURSTER: You're relieved of your post. Go.
KURSTER: Take up your place. Come on.
GRENDEL: Well?
KURSTER: Everything is ready, my lord.
GRENDEL: The peasants are prepared?
KURSTER: I have my men dressed as peasants, my lord. As soon as it is announced that the Prince has not appeared for the coronation, there will be a spontaneous demonstration of love and loyalty to the House of Gracht.
GRENDEL: I think I shall reject the crown once. Rejecting it twice might be misconstrued. Besides, I'm not sure I can trust the Archimandrite to offer it to me a third time.
ARCHIMANDRITE: The hour approaches, Count Grendel.
GRENDEL: It does indeed, your Eminence.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Where is the Prince?
GRENDEL: No doubt he will be here, your Eminence.
ARCHIMANDRITE: If he misses the appointed hour of his coronation, we must choose another king. That is the law.
GRENDEL: I know.
ARCHIMANDRITE: It is possible we may choose you.
GRENDEL: You overwhelm me, your Eminence.
ZADEK: We're nearly there. The steps to the Coronation chamber are just round the corner.
FARRAH: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What? Stop him!
FARRAH: Is he going to be all right?
DOCTOR: Let's hope so. Off you go.
FARRAH: Look out!
ZADEK: We've been followed! Doctor, take the Prince. We'll try to hold them off here. There's a lever at the top. Pull it down. It opens a panel. Hurry!
DOCTOR: It can't have been moved for two hundred years. It's stuck! It won't move.
ARCHIMANDRITE: There's no sign of the Prince, Count Grendel.
GRENDEL: He would appear to be late, your Eminence.
ARCHIMANDRITE: If he doesn't appear by the appointed time, it is my duty under the law to offer the crown to one of the other nobles.
GRENDEL: My dear Archimandrite, you may rest assured that whoever you choose to be King of Tara will immediately be offered the protection of my guard.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Your guard? These are your men?
GRENDEL: Er, the palace guard proved to be indisposed.
ARCHIMANDRITE: I see. Perhaps, in the circumstances, it would be simpler if I offered you the crown immediately.
GRENDEL: An excellent suggestion, my dear Archimandrite. It would avoid a great deal of possible unpleasantness later. But we must wait for the exact moment. Everything must be done correctly.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Noble sentiments, Count. Nobly spoken.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Look, it is time. It is time! Open the doors.
GRENDEL: Impossible.
ARCHIMANDRITE: All kneel to our sovereign lord, Prince Reynart.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Kneel!
ARCHIMANDRITE: Behold the crown of Tara.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Hail to the King! Hail to King Reynart of Tara!
NOBLES: Hail! Hail to the King!
ARCHIMANDRITE: Your Majesty. The speech of accession. You must say it.
GEORGE: My subjects, I acknowledge your salutations and I swear that I will uphold your rights and devote myself to defending and pro-o-o-tecting you at all times.
DOCTOR:  I'll do some more work on his speech circuits.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Let all the nobles now swear the oath of fealty to the King.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Let the First Lady of the land of Tara come forward and make her vows.
DOCTOR: Romana?
ZADEK: That's the Princess Strella.
STRELLA:  I, Princess Strella, descendant of the Royal Kings of Tara, Mistress of the domains of Thorvald, Mortgarde and Freya, do humbly offer my loyalty to the King and do hereby recognise his suzerainty over me and all whom I command.
DOCTOR: No!
Part Three
ZADEK: Are you mad?
ARCHIMANDRITE: Seize him! He's killed the Princess.
FARRAH: Stop! That's not the Princess.
ARCHIMANDRITE: It's an android.
ZADEK: How did you know?
DOCTOR: A circuit must have been faulty. I heard it spark.
GRENDEL: And who might you be, pray?
ARCHIMANDRITE: But it doesn't make sense. Why send an android to swear loyalty to the King?
DOCTOR: To get close enough to kill him.
ARCHIMANDRITE: But who would want to kill the King?
DOCTOR: Ah.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Unless
GRENDEL: My dear Archimandrite, what are you suggesting?
ZADEK: Treachery against His Majesty.
GRENDEL: Take care what you say, Zadek. Your Eminence, I suggest we postpone the oath-taking for the time being. Who knows how many other programmed androids there may be.
ARCHIMANDRITE: You think there are more?
GRENDEL: It is a possibility we must face, your Eminence. I shall leave my own personal guard here to protect His Majesty.
ZADEK: I'm afraid I cannot permit that, Count.
GRENDEL: It is not for you to say.
ZADEK: As Commander of His Majesty's bodyguard, it is my decision and mine alone.
GRENDEL: You presume too much, Zadek. Well, what does His Majesty have to say on the matter? He is very quiet.
DOCTOR: Ahem. His Majesty is very tired. Can't you talk about this tomorrow?
GRENDEL: Who the devil are you, sir?
DOCTOR: I'm the King's Doctor.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Is His Majesty ill?
DOCTOR: No, nothing a nice rest won't cure. He'll be all right tomorrow.
ARCHIMANDRITE: I understand, Doctor. Come, Count. We must allow His Majesty to rest.
GRENDEL: But what of the danger?
DOCTOR: What possible danger can His Majesty be in from his own personal bodyguard, Count?
ZADEK: Will he be all right tomorrow?
DOCTOR: Not unless I can recharge his power packs and repair his speech circuits.
LAMIA: Is this yours?
ROMANA: Yes.
LAMIA: What is it?
ROMANA: What is it?
LAMIA: Yes. What is it made of?
ROMANA: Oh, I've no idea. I only found it the other day.
LAMIA: It's like no substance I have ever seen before. I have blunted two diamond drills on it.
ROMANA: Well, perhaps it's some kind of quartz?
LAMIA: This is no quartz.
ROMANA: Well, if you don't want it, could I have it back? You've no use for it, have you?
LAMIA: I don't suppose it matters. What could you possibly do with it? No.
ROMANA: Why not?
LAMIA: I'm curious. It looks as though it might be part of something.
ROMANA: Part of what?
GRENDEL: It failed. The machine failed. That doctor saw at once it was an android.
LAMIA: My lord, I did warn you it wasn't ready.
ROMANA: What doctor?
GRENDEL: Oh, some strange doctor who's attending the Prince.
LAMIA: We hold the real Prince. What you have seen must have been an android.
GRENDEL: Obviously. Do you know this doctor?
ROMANA: No.
GRENDEL: I think you do. Lamia, prepare another android. An exact copy precise to the last detail. I have an idea. Our guest can help us.
K9: Master.
DOCTOR: K9.
K9: I have located the mistress. She is in Castle Gracht.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
K9: Affirmative, master. I detected her presence quite distinctly.
DOCTOR: Good. Well, that means the Count has Romana, the real Princess and the Prince.
ZADEK: So Grendel now holds all the cards.
DOCTOR: No, I wouldn't say that. We've still got a prince of sorts.
ZADEK: He has to attend the convocation with the Archimandrite and the priests. Will he be able to?
DOCTOR: Well, K9, what would happen if I connect the carbon circuit to the silicon circuit? How long would they last?
DOCTOR: Come on.
K9: Three hours nine minutes and ten point seven seconds, approximately.
GRENDEL: Comfortable, my dear?
LAMIA: My lord?
GRENDEL: What is it?
LAMIA: These are like no alpha waves I have ever seen before.
GRENDEL: What do you mean?
LAMIA: She is not Taran.
GRENDEL: Then what is she?
LAMIA: I don't know. I need more time for evaluation.
GRENDEL: Time we don't have, my dear. Just programme another android to kill, that's all, but this time make sure it's a perfect copy.
LAMIA: Yes, my lord.
DOCTOR: Go on, ask him a question. Go on.
ZADEK: The question of monastic lands. That's bound to come up at the convocation. What is His Majesty's position on that?
GEORGE: Monastic lands are held by the religious orders under the protection of the Crown. Those lands and that protection may be withdrawn at my discretion at any time.
ZADEK: Good.
GEORGE: I propose to be discreet for the time being.
ZADEK: Yes. Doctor, the Prince
GEORGE: King.
ZADEK: Oh, quite so, your Majesty.
DOCTOR: Zadek.
ZADEK: Oh, drat. I keep forgetting he's only an android. Doctor, the King seems to be, how shall I say, a trifle more
DOCTOR: Intelligent than the real one? Well, of course he is. I programmed him.
ZADEK: We don't want him too intelligent, Doctor. You can't trust androids, you know.
DOCTOR: It's funny, you know. That's what some androids say about people.
ZADEK: What?
DOCTOR: Anyway, how can you possibly be frightened of something that goes pfft if it short-circuits?
FARRAH: Someone to speak to the Doctor, sir.
ZADEK: Who?
DOCTOR: Ah.
TILL: My name is Till. I am but a servant to the Count.
ZADEK: And what do you want?
TILL: My mission is with the doctor, Swordsman, not with thee.
FARRAH: You dare to refuse to speak to a Master of the Sword?
TILL: Swordsman, I will speak only to the doctor. Those are my orders.
DOCTOR: Quite right, too. Quite right. We peasants have got to stick together. Now then, what can I do for you, huh?
TILL: I have a message from Madame Lamia.
DOCTOR: Lamia?
TILL: Yeah, she's Count Grendel's woman, a peasant.
DOCTOR: Well?
TILL: She would have me tell you that she fears for the Count's safety.
DOCTOR: Why?
TILL: Now they've crowned the android King, the Count is politically powerless.
DOCTOR: Shush. Come over here.
FARRAH: I suppose he can be trusted?
GEORGE: Who, the servant or the Doctor?
FARRAH: The Doctor, of course.  He can be trusted, can't he, sir?
ZADEK: I wish we knew more about him.
FARRAH: There's only one way to settle this.
K9: Do not activate your sword.
FARRAH: Good dog. Good dog.
DOCTOR: Lamia's offered us a deal.
ZADEK: What?
DOCTOR: Romana in exchange for the safe conduct out of the country of Count Grendel.
ZADEK: You refused, of course.
DOCTOR: No, no, I accepted. I'm to take a written undertaking from you and the King for Grendel's safety, then Lamia and her friends will pass Romana over to me.
FARRAH: It's an obvious trap. You can't go.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can.
ZADEK: Where is the meeting to take place?
DOCTOR: At a place called the Pavilion of the Summer Winds. Do you know where it is?
ZADEK: Yes. It's on Grendel's estate, in the woods near the castle.
DOCTOR: Good. I shall have to go alone, of course. It's funny, they always want you to go alone when you're walking into a trap. Have you noticed that?
GRENDEL: You've excelled yourself, my dear Lamia. It's absolutely perfect. Don't you agree?
ROMANA: The Doctor'll spot it immediately.
GRENDEL: In the dark at a distance of twenty feet? I think not, my dear.
ROMANA: He'll know it's a trap.
GRENDEL: Of course! That's what gives the situation such a delicious edge.
ROMANA: He won't come.
GRENDEL: You underestimate your friend, my dear. Of course he'll come. What else could he do? It's his only chance of rescuing you. Oh, he'll be very careful, very cautious. He'll bide his time. But sooner or later he must find out if that figure in the Pavilion is you or not. And when he does. Show her, Lamia.
DOCTOR : Hello, Romana. How are you?
GRENDEL: Rather ingenious, don't you think? You are to be congratulated, my dear.
ROMANA: How did you get the voice?
LAMIA: The Count's man, Till, recorded his voice patterns when they parleyed. Once I have the pattern, the construction of speech is a simple matter.
ROMANA: It won't work.
GRENDEL: Why not?
ROMANA: Well, supposing the Doctor doesn't speak?
LAMIA: The android is also programmed to kill in various other ways.
GRENDEL: You see before you the complete killing machine, as beautiful as you and as deadly as the plague. If only she were real, I'd marry her.
ROMANA: You deserve each other.
GRENDEL: Come, my dear.
LAMIA: Guard! Guard!
LAMIA: What kept you so long? Bring this one back to the cells.
LAMIA: Leave us. I will lock up the prisoner.
ROMANA: You know, if Grendel does become king, he'll never make you his queen.
LAMIA: Nor you, either. I will see to that.
ROMANA: Ah, but I don't want him and you do, don't you. Look, why don't you let me go? All you have to do is release me and the Doctor, and I'll leave Tara. Think about it. What have you got to lose?
LAMIA: Grendel.
ROMANA: Well, you haven't exactly got him now, have you? All he's doing is using you.
LAMIA: I know. But that is better than nothing.
ROMANA: Now, how does the Doctor do this?
DOCTOR: Shush. Steady, K9, steady. Let's take a look.
ROMANA: Shush. We're getting out of here.
REYNART: Save yourself.
ROMANA: And leave you behind? They'll kill you.
REYNART: I'm, I'm too weak. I'd only get in the way.
ROMANA: Listen, Grendel's taken most of the guards with him. Now's our chance.
REYNART: Then take it. Don't waste time with me. Tell Zadek where I am. He'll know what to do.
REYNART: That's it.
ROMANA: Okay.
REYNART: Like that. Good. Ready?
ROMANA: Go ahead.
ROMANA: Guard! Guard! Guard, quickly! The Prince!
KURSTER: My lord. The men are in position, my lord.
GRENDEL: Good. Await my signal. Tell them to be ready.
KURSTER: Yes, sir.
GRENDEL: You know what to do, my dear.
LAMIA: Yes. When this Doctor arrives, you leave him to me.
GRENDEL: What should I do without you?
LAMIA: Find another peasant who understands androids, no doubt.
GRENDEL: True, but I should not find one who pleased me so much.
GRENDEL: Go now, before he arrives.
Meanwhile, Romana has got as far as the castle courtyard, where Grendel's white horse stands waiting for a rider. The guard at the far end of the gateway is leaning on his crossbow looking outwards. Romana uses the wrong foot in the stirrup to mount the patient horse, and shuffles herself round whilst looking for the start button.)
ROMANA: Go, Charger. Start. Start! Go, you stupid creature, go!
DOCTOR: Hello. You're early.
LAMIA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. Madame Lamia, is it?
LAMIA: We agreed to meet at midnight.
DOCTOR: Yes, but I had nothing better to do so I thought I'd come early. What's your reason?
LAMIA: Do I need one?
DOCTOR: No, but it would have been fun to hear it. Where's Romana?
LAMIA: You agree to my terms?
DOCTOR: I do indeed. Safe conduct for Count Grendel in return for Romana, also safe and sound.
LAMIA: Yes.
DOCTOR: Where is Romana? You realise, of course, that Count Grendel will have to go into exile, but there's no reason then why you can't go into exile with him, is there? Where's Romana?
LAMIA: Outside.
DOCTOR: You bring her in. It's a good offer, Lamia. A fair offer.
LAMIA: Well, Doctor, aren't you going to greet your friend?
K9: Caution, master.
DOCTOR: What is it, K9?
LAMIA: Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!
DOCTOR: In focus, K9?
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Now!
GRENDEL: Something's gone wrong. Attack the Pavilion!
LAMIA: My lord! My lord!
GRENDEL: You fools! That was Madame Lamia! Hold your fire!
GRENDEL: Doctor, I know you're in there. There's only one entrance to that pavilion. Come out, Doctor. Surrender. We won't harm you.  Tell the bowmen to fire immediately they see the target. I want him destroyed. Well, Doctor? Are you coming out? You have my word as a Gracht you will not be harmed.
K9: Ill-advised, master.
DOCTOR: What? You just leave it to me, K9. I know exactly what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: Liar!
DOCTOR: It's time we got out of here, isn't it, K9.
K9: Affirmative, master.
DOCTOR: Around here, do you think?
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Come on!
KURSTER: There he is! He's got out!
GRENDEL: Ten thousand gold pieces to the man who shoots the Doctor!
GRENDEL: Wait. Listen.
KURSTER: The Princess! Hold your fire!
DOCTOR: Everyone for himself, K9!
GRENDEL: Fools! Dolts! That wasn't the Princess, it was Romana! After them!
DOCTOR: I hope you know how to stop this thing when we get there.
ZADEK: While Grendel still thinks we're in the Palace, we may be able to surprise him. You must bring up a troop of bowmen under cover of darkness and position them on the left flank, here.
ZADEK: Doctor!
FARRAH: It's the Princess!
ROMANA: No, I'm Romana.
ZADEK: Incredible.
DOCTOR: Isn't it?
ROMANA: Ah, this must be the android King.
DOCTOR: Yes. We call him George.
ROMANA: And these gentlemen?
DOCTOR: Oh, they're real, I think.
ZADEK: This is Swordsman Farrah. I am Swordmaster Zadek.
ROMANA: Zadek? I have a message for you from the real king.
ZADEK: You've seen His Majesty? How is he?
ROMANA: He's not very well. We must think of a plan to rescue him.
DOCTOR:  Horseman approaching.
FARRAH:  Under a flag of truce. It's Count Grendel! I'll kill the traitor!
ZADEK: Not if he comes under a flag of truce. You know the articles of war, Swordsman.
FARRAH: I'm not sure Count Grendel does, sir.
ZADEK: Disarm the Count, then, and bring him in.
GRENDEL: Good day, gentlemen. I come to you under a flag of truce and expect to be treated according to the usages of war.
ZADEK: What do you want?
GRENDEL: How are you, your android Majesty?
GEORGE: I. Am. Well.
GRENDEL: He doesn't sound it. Power packs need recharging, I expect.
DOCTOR: Nothing that can't be fixed, Count.
GRENDEL: Oh, Doctor! Well, there you are. I was glad you managed to escape safely.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, so was I.
GRENDEL: Tell me now, where is the charming Romana?
ZADEK: What do you want, Count Grendel?
GRENDEL: Only a word with the Doctor, according to the usages of war.
DOCTOR: Me?
GRENDEL: Shall we?
GRENDEL: Ah, excellent.
DOCTOR: Well?
GRENDEL: Oh, Doctor, you're a remarkable man.
DOCTOR: I am?
GRENDEL: Yes, a man after my own heart.
DOCTOR: I am?
GRENDEL: Here you are, new to Taran politics, and in no time at all what have you become?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Go on, you tell me.
GRENDEL: Kingmaker extraordinary. Thanks to you keeping that micro-circuitry going, Zadek has his king. But have you thought what would happen if something went seriously wrong, like an overload on the circuits?
DOCTOR: What would happen?
GRENDEL: Your usefulness ceases.
DOCTOR: What?
GRENDEL: You know too much. You become a dangerous embarrassment to Zadek. An embarrassment to be got rid of, and don't think he wouldn't.
DOCTOR: What's the answer?
GRENDEL: Suppose we both unmade our kings. No more King Reynart at all.
DOCTOR: What? What would that achieve? 
GRENDEL: A vacancy for a new king.
DOCTOR: Ah. You, I suppose?
GRENDEL: No, no, no, Doctor, no. There would be opposition. No, I was thinking you'd make an excellent king.
DOCTOR: Me? Just a moment.
DOCTOR: The Count's just offered me the throne.
ZADEK: That's treason, Count.
GRENDEL: Only so long as the King is alive!
ZADEK: Seize him!
FARRAH: Why did you do that?
DOCTOR: Because he's got Romana. Look!
ROMANA: Stop! Let me go! Doctor, Doctor, help me! Doctor!
Part Four
ZADEK: Commander, take six men, mount up and follow the Count.
DOCTOR: He'll be halfway to Castle Gracht by now.
FARRAH: You know, you almost have to admire the man.
ZADEK: Admire him? I should have killed him when he walked in here, flag of truce or no flag of truce.
FARRAH: You've got to admit, sir, it takes courage to walk in here, to distract our attention while his men kidnap Miss Romana. I mean, it takes nerve.
ZADEK: Nerve is one quality Grendel has never been short of.
 
REYNART: Romana!
ROMANA: Are you all right?
REYNART: I thought you'd escaped.
GRENDEL: She had, but I knew Your Majesty couldn't live without her, so I brought her back for you.
ROMANA: Why do you torment him?
GRENDEL: Oh, now that's really most unfair, my dear. I'm really quite hurt. All I'm doing is to restore to His Majesty his bride-to-be.
ROMANA: What?
GRENDEL: You'll make a lovely couple.
ROMANA: What's his idea? Is it a joke?
REYNART: Oh, no. Grendel doesn't joke about political power.
ROMANA: Then what's his plan?
REYNART: To become legal, rightful King of Tara. You see, if you marry me you will automatically become Queen, but five minutes after the wedding you would almost certainly be a widow.
ROMANA: He'd kill you?
REYNART: He would. And the moment you're widowed, Count Grendel, that well-known champion of widows and orphans, would step in and marry you, thus becoming Consort of the rightful Queen of Tara.
ROMANA: And then it would be my turn for an unfortunate accident.
REYNART: Precisely.
GRENDEL: This is not wine, but vinegar. Fetch good wine, dog!
GRENDEL: Ah, Archimandrite. Welcome.
ARCHIMANDRITE: What is so urgent that I must leave my duties and hurry here like this?
GRENDEL: I'm sorry, Archimandrite, but there is a ceremony you must perform.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Here? What ceremony?
GRENDEL: A marriage.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Your own chaplain could have done that.
GRENDEL: Not this marriage.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Why? Who is to be married, and to whom?
GRENDEL: The King to the Princess Strella.
ARCHIMANDRITE: The King? Here?
GRENDEL: He has placed himself under my protection, your Eminence. Sadly, I have to tell you he is sick. In fact, he's very near to death.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Oh, dear, dear, dear. He did not look well at the coronation. Not himself at all.
GRENDEL: No. No, I did note that, Archimandrite.
ARCHIMANDRITE: But near to death, you say?
GRENDEL: Indeed he is. It would be as well if you stayed here. I fear he will be in need of the funeral rites very soon after the wedding.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Oh, how sad.
GRENDEL: Mmm, yes. And after the funeral rites, there will be a second wedding for you to perform.
ARCHIMANDRITE: A second wedding? May I ask whose that will be?
GRENDEL: My own. I shall be marrying the poor King's widow.
FARRAH: But surely, sir, we have a supply problem if we place the batteries there.
ZADEK: But if we do what you're suggesting, we expose our left flank.
DOCTOR: How long do you think the siege will last, Zadek?
ZADEK: Hard to say. The last siege of the Castle of Gracht went on for nearly two years.
DOCTOR: Two years? Well, we haven't got two years before Grendel kills both the King and Romana. Anyway, looking at that plan, I'd say there's only one way into the castle.
ZADEK: What's that?
DOCTOR: If someone on the inside opens the main gate and a group of our men, under cover of darkness, take the guard by surprise.
FARRAH: That's hardly ethical.
ZADEK: Have you ever known Grendel abide by the rules of war? But who's going to open the gates?
DOCTOR: Me.
ZADEK: One man alone?
DOCTOR: No, no. One man and his dog. Come on, K9.
GRENDEL: Open.
GRENDEL: Your Highness.
STRELLA: Grendel.
GRENDEL: I have come to offer you one last chance to change your mind.
STRELLA: Never.
GRENDEL: The Archimandrite is here, the King is here. It will be quite easy for you.
STRELLA: Grendel, I've told you already. I will never marry you under any circumstances, and I will not marry the King under these circumstances.
GRENDEL: Come, come, my dear. Don't you want to be Queen?
STRELLA: I know, Grendel, that as long as I refuse to marry the King, his life is safe.
GRENDEL: Huh. And that matters to you?
STRELLA: More than my own life. For the last time, I will not go through any marriage under your roof. You can kill me if you like.
GRENDEL: Very well, my dear, I may just do that before long. You have become dispensable, Princess.
GRENDEL: Open.
GRENDEL: How is he?
ROMANA: Very weak.
GRENDEL: Oh, what a shame. I fear he's not long for this world.
ROMANA: Nonsense. All he needs is some proper medical
GRENDEL: I know exactly what he needs, my dear. Just as long as he's the strength left for a little ceremony.
REYNART: Never. Do you hear me, Grendel? Never.
GRENDEL: Oh, what a pity, because I'm sure you wouldn't want to be the cause of Princess Strella's death, would you?
REYNART: What do you mean?
GRENDEL: Or you, my dear.
ROMANA: What are you saying?
GRENDEL: The Princess, the real Princess, that is, is in the next dungeon. For the moment she's quite safe.
REYNART: If you harm her, Grendel
GRENDEL: What! What can you do? Be quiet and listen to me. I had everything arranged before this girl and her friend interfered. Madame Lamia was preparing a perfect android copy of the Princess for you to marry. You would have been married with full ceremony, and after your unfortunate death at her hands, she would have married me. Now Madame Lamia is dead and the android can never be completed. So, we need another bride.
ROMANA: Well, if you think you can persuade me to marry anybody, you're wrong.
GRENDEL: Oh, but I do. I'm sure you will. Because if you refuse, the Princess will die. Very slowly. Now what have you to say? Good. I thought you'd see reason. I shall return shortly. Be ready.
DOCTOR: All right, K9, let's go.
ZADEK: The old watergate should be right under the far wall.
DOCTOR: Good.
ZADEK: I'm afraid the door must be a foot thick. The timbers were intended to withstand any battering ram.
DOCTOR: Don't worry.
ZADEK: But
DOCTOR: Don't worry, we'll manage. You just make sure you're all ready to charge in the moment those gates are open.
FARRAH: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes?
FARRAH: Take this. You may need it.
DOCTOR: Too complicated for me.
ZADEK: We'll be waiting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good.
ZADEK: Good luck.
GRENDEL: Is everything ready?
TILL: Almost, master.
GRENDEL: There must be no hitches in any of the ceremonies tonight.
TILL: No, master.
GRENDEL: Kurster, a word.
KURSTER: My lord.
GRENDEL: Make sure our guards are alert. You yourself watch everything. At the first sign of trouble, get down to the dungeons and deal with the Princess. You understand me?
KURSTER: I do, my lord.
GRENDEL: I shall deal with the King myself.
KURSTER: I shall be nearby if you need help.
GRENDEL: Ah, Archimandrite. Are you ready?
ARCHIMANDRITE: I am. Where are the happy couple? They are in their quarters. I shall inform them we are ready and conduct them here myself.
DOCTOR: Here we are, K9. Here we are. This must be it.
K9: Affirmative, master. This is the position marked on the plan.
DOCTOR: Shush. Quiet. Just start cutting.
GRENDEL: Open.
GRENDEL: Kurster.
GRENDEL: Well, why so miserable? This should be the happiest day of your life. It will also be your last, so you might as well enjoy it.
GRENDEL: Remember, no trouble or the Princess dies. That I promise.
DOCTOR: Hear that, K9? Wedding bells or a funeral knell? Do hurry up. A hamster with a blunt penknife would do it quicker.
K9: You ordered me to make no noise, master.
DOCTOR: Just get on with it.
GRENDEL: Cheer up, it'll all be over soon. I'm sorry there's no bridal march, my dear. Guard!
GRENDEL: After you.
DOCTOR: About time, too.
DOCTOR: Good.
DOCTOR: You all right? Now listen, there's bound to be lots of stairs in there. You stay here and keep an eye on the boat. I might have to bring the others out this way if anything goes wrong.
K9: Affirmative, master.
DOCTOR: And don't fall in the water.
K9: I am familiar with boats, master.
DOCTOR: You old sea dog, you. Now don't forget, stand guard and be careful. Be careful!
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: Shush!
ARCHIMANDRITE: Both kneel.
GRENDEL: Remember the Princess.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Do you, Reynart, King of Tara, take this woman, the Princess Strella, to be your lawful wedded wife?  Your Majesty?
REYNART: I do.
ARCHIMANDRITE: And do you, Strella, Princess of the Royal House of Tara, take this man, Reynart, King of Tara, to be your lawful wedded husband?
DOCTOR: No!
ROMANA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: No, she doesn't. Hello, everyone. Sorry I'm late. If there's something I always enjoy, it's a good wedding, isn't that true, Romana?  Now, listen. Have you got to the bit where you ask them if there's any just cause why they shouldn't be joined in
GRENDEL: You seem to make a habit of interfering in my affairs, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I do really.
GRENDEL: Well, you've done it for the last time.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Stop! This is a solemn ceremony!
ROMANA: Not any more, it isn't.
ARCHIMANDRITE: Stop!
GRENDEL: Leave him, leave him. he's mine. Defend yourself, sir.
DOCTOR: I haven't brought my sword.
GRENDEL: Well, I've no wish to kill a man without a weapon in his hand. Here.
GRENDEL: Till!
ROMANA: Doctor, he's the best swordsman on Tara.
DOCTOR: Is he?
ROMANA: Do you know what you're doing? Good luck.
GRENDEL: I shall give you a fencing lesson before you die.
GRENDEL: En garde!
GRENDEL: You improve, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Gate control.
REYNART: Where is it?
FARRAH: He's done it! Come on!
STRELLA: Who are you?
ROMANA: Well, that's a very long story.
DOCTOR: It's all over, Grendel. That's Zadek and his men. Listen! You might as well surrender now.
GRENDEL: Surrender? You forget, Doctor, I'm a Gracht. We never surrender.
GRENDEL: Next time I shall not be so lenient!
DOCTOR: Grendel, you forgot your hat!
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are. Everyone all right? Thank you.
REYNART: Doctor, I owe you my life. How can I repay you?
DOCTOR: Oh, it was a pleasure to be of service.
ZADEK: Such swordsmanship. I never thought I'd live to see the day when anyone would beat Count Grendel.
DOCTOR: Really? Why, was he supposed to be good?
FARRAH: He can jest after a fight like that.
REYNART: Why not stay here? This castle and all its lands can be yours. Anything you care to name.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, that's a very kind offer, Majesty, but I have a pressing engagement on the other side of the galaxy. Has anybody here seen Romana?
REYNART: She followed Kurster out.
DOCTOR: Kurster? What?
REYNART: The Princess Strella!
DOCTOR: Where?
REYNART: In the dungeons!
DOCTOR: What!
DOCTOR: No!
ROMANA: But there are so many different types of stitch. It must take years to learn the art.
STRELLA: It's really only a question of patience and a certain delicacy of touch. I'm sure you can manage it. Go on. That's right. Very good.
DOCTOR: Don't move! I said, don't move.  Ah, you must be Princess Strella.
STRELLA: Er, no. I'm Princess Strella.
DOCTOR: How do you do. I'm delighted to meet you. Romana.
ROMANA: Right.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to take your new friend away so soon, Miss, but we have some urgent business to attend to.
ROMANA: The segment!
DOCTOR: Right.
REYNART: Strella! You're safe.
REYNART: And you're real.
DOCTOR: Well?
ROMANA: Doctor, it was in here somewhere. It's disappeared.
DOCTOR: Use the tracer.
ROMANA: Oh, right.
DOCTOR: Ah!
ROMANA: Very funny.
DOCTOR: You were very careless. I found it when I came in here. Come on, let's go.
ROMANA: Do you know, I'll be quite sorry to leave Tara.
DOCTOR: What? Sorry to leave Tara? I didn't even catch one fish. Not one! Come on!
ROMANA: Doctor! Talking of forgetting things, where's K9?
DOCTOR: Well, he. Where's K9?
DOCTOR: K9? K9!
K9: Master. Master!
