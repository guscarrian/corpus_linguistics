Planet of Evil
Part One
BALDWIN: Yep?
BRAUN: Base checking. You all right out there?
BALDWIN : All quiet.
BRAUN : Where are you?
BALDWIN: Sector five. We've hit a rich load.
BRAUN: Sector five? Listen, I just took a sun shot. You have fifteen degrees to full night. You'd better get out of there fast.
BALDWIN: Right. Professor, that was Braun. We've got to leave.
SORENSON: What?
BALDWIN: It's fifteen degrees to night.
SORENSON: Just look at this, Baldwin. It's showing more than seventy pure.
BALDWIN: We'll never make base from here, sir, if we don't leave now.
SORENSON: The last time we hit a vein as rich as this, you know what happened?
BALDWIN: Yes. Lorenzo died. He was the first. That's when it all seemed to start.
SORENSON: We lost it. The vein vanished. This damned planet took it back. It's alive, you know, Baldwin. It watches every move we make. I won't be beaten again. Load the canisters.
BALDWIN: Professor, please. There isn't time now. We can return tomorrow.
SORENSON: It'll be gone by tomorrow. Don't you see, man? It knows. It senses what we're trying to do.
BALDWIN: I'm not trekking back through that jungle in the dark. If you don't come now, I shall have to leave you.
SORENSON: Well, then, leave. Leave.
BALDWIN: Braun? Braun?
BALDWIN: Sorenson wouldn't come. He. Braun? Where are you?
SARAH: How long have we been travelling?
DOCTOR: Hmm? What did you say?
SARAH: You promised me we'd be back in London five minutes before leaving Loch Ness.
DOCTOR: Did I?
SARAH: Oh, you're trying to wriggle out of it.
DOCTOR: Wriggle out of what?
SARAH: Your promise.
DOCTOR: Listen, we're on the edge of a time-space vortex and you're talking in minutes.
SARAH: Oh, I see. What's gone wrong this time?
DOCTOR: Nothing. Nothing at all. What makes you think something's gone wrong?
SARAH: Because you always get rude when you're trying to cover up a mistake.
DOCTOR: Nothing of consequence. Slight overshoot, easily rectified.
SARAH: Come on, where are we?
DOCTOR: We've come out of the time vortex at the wrong point, that's all. A few years too late.
SARAH: How many?
DOCTOR: Thirty thousand.
SARAH: That's a distress call.
DOCTOR: Someone's in trouble.
SARAH: Where?
DOCTOR: Who knows? Stand by for emergency materialisation.
SARAH: Which way?
DOCTOR: This way.
SARAH: You don't know where we are.
DOCTOR: Oh, with any luck, we're near enough to reach wherever it is.
SARAH: That is not what I meant.
DOCTOR: Before whatever it was that made them transmit the call overwhelms them. That is, if we're not too late already.
SARAH: I mean, what planet?
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a weak signal. Allowing for the fact of interference from the time warp, could you move any faster?
SARAH: I'm doing the best I can.
VISHINSKY: There it is, Zeta Minor. The last planet of the known universe.
SALAMAR: Crew deck, orbital entry imminent. Ponti and de Haan to command area. Ponti and de Haan to command area. Vishinsky, you'll lead the landing party.
VISHINSKY: Without Ponti?
SALAMAR: You are the most experienced officer.
VISHINSKY: You are going to scan first?
SALAMAR: No.
VISHINSKY: It's advised procedure before physical landing on any ex-planet.
SALAMAR: Technically, Zeta Minor is not an ex-planet. Professor Sorenson's party's been on the surface for months.
VISHINSKY: They might have been dead for months. They've not reported.
SALAMAR: Vishinsky, you know our fuel position. We've enough for the return journey and an emergency reserve. I cannot waste that on a low level scan.
VISHINSKY: It's your decision, Controller. I'll get equipped for descent.
DOCTOR: Sarah? You all right? What's the matter?
SARAH: I don't know. Just suddenly felt so odd, as though my mind left my body.
DOCTOR: Are you all right now?
SARAH: Yes.
DOCTOR: You look all right.
SARAH: Yeah. What's that you've found?
DOCTOR: Hand tool of some kind.
SARAH: So the people who sent that signal must be humanoid. Well, if they've got hands?
SALAMAR: The descent chamber's ready, Ponti.
PONTI:  Yes, Controller.
SALAMAR: The probe will remain in free orbit in case emergency escape procedures are needed. From the time you land, maintain permanent audio contact.
DE HAAN: Understood, Controller.
SALAMAR: The descent area is the one selected for Sorenson, so you should have no difficulty locating the base.
VISHINSKY: Unless something gets in our way.
SALAMAR: You're equipped and trained to deal with all normal contingencies. The prime purpose of this mission is to locate Professor Sorenson's expedition. If hostile forces are found to be operating on Zeta Minor, we've the capacity to eliminate them.
SALAMAR: Right, we're in orbit. Prepare for descent.
SARAH: Looks like we're too late.
DOCTOR: Several months too late, by the look of him.
DOCTOR: Anyone about? No one about.
SARAH: Can't we have some lights?
DOCTOR: Probably the power's run down.
SARAH: That would account for the weak signal.
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Automatic distress button. It all adds up. May have been running for months. High capacity power cell dependant for sunlight on charging.
SARAH: So we're still in the solar system.
DOCTOR: We're still in a solar system, but what particular star provides the light and energy? Wherever we are, we're a long way out. SARAH: I wonder what happened here?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well, this is clearly the base for some kind of scientific expedition, possibly geological. Something went wrong and they sent out a distress signal.
SARAH: And died before help arrived.
DOCTOR: Yes, something like that. A lost expedition.
SARAH: So, what are we going to do?
DOCTOR: So, let's go back to the Tardis and fetch my spectromixer, and I'll fix our position by that star. Then I'll repair this power cell and try and make contact.
SARAH: Well, you can get on with that now. I'll fetch the spectromixer.
DOCTOR: Good idea. Would you do that?
SARAH: Why not? I know the way.
DOCTOR: Good thinking. What are you waiting for?
SARAH: The key.
DOCTOR: Oh.
SARAH: Right. See you.
DOCTOR: Sarah.
VISHINSKY: Don't touch. Keep back. It may be a trap. Landing party to probe.
SALAMAR: Understood. You've acted correctly. Do not attempt entry.
VISHINSKY : Shall we apply disintegrators?
SALAMAR: On no account. It'll yield essential information on hostile forces. Your orders are, transpose object to probe. Out. Prepare the quarantine berth.
VISHINSKY: All right, stand clear.
VISHINSKY: Movement. Over there. Approach and identify yourself.
VISHINSKY: Professor Sorenson!
SORENSON: I've been observing you for some time. One has to be careful on this planet. Appearances can be deceptive.
VISHINSKY: You all right, Professor?
SORENSON: Oh, yes. It's nearly dawn. The days are quite safe.
VISHINSKY: But how are you? Galactic Mission Control received no word from you. They sent us to investigate.
SORENSON: I'm well. I'm more than well. My theory about Zeta Minor has proved to be true. Only last night I made the vital discovery in Sector five.
VISHINSKY: Where are the others?
SORENSON: Baldwin returned to the base last night. He was suffering from, from fatigue. He'll be fine now. Come, I'll show you the way.
VISHINSKY: There were eight in your expedition.
SORENSON: Yes, we've had difficulties. Conditions are hard. We've lost some, but the important thing is the mission has been a success. We found what we came to find.
VISHINSKY: How many have you lost?
SORENSON: He'll be fine now. It's just tiredness. He needs a good rest. It's not far.
SORENSON: Baldwin?
DOCTOR: He's dead.
SORENSON: Yes. Murdered. Just like the others.
VISHINSKY: Stay where you are.
SALAMAR: Stand just where you are.
SARAH: Where am I?
SALAMAR: You are in orbit around planet Zeta Minor. You're a Morestran prisoner.
SARAH: I can't breathe.
SALAMAR: An oxygen type. Could be an Earthling. Transfer oxygen to quarantine area.
MORELLI: Command deck calling you, Commander.
SALAMAR: Right. Complete the quarantine procedures and bring the alien to me. You see what she's holding?
VISHINSKY: He calls himself the Doctor. He's not of our world. Claims to have landed in response to a distress call.
SALAMAR: Have you checked the transmitters down there?
VISHINSKY: Yes, but any signal would have been monitored by our receivers.
DOCTOR: Perhaps my receivers are better than yours.
PONTI: Shut up!
DOCTOR: My manners certainly are.
SALAMAR: Can't Sorenson explain?
VISHINSKY : He's too shocked. His mental state is strained.
SALAMAR: Understandable. We arrived just in time. And the prisoner?
VISHINSKY : Just repeats the same story.
SALAMAR: Keep a careful watch on him. I may have better fortune.
SALAMAR: You picked it up?
SARAH: That's what I said. We picked up a distress call and landed immediately.
SALAMAR: Do you have any idea where Zeta Minor is situated?
SARAH: No, not exactly.
SALAMAR: It's beyond Cygnus A. It's as distant again from Ortoro galaxy as that galaxy is from the Anterades. It's on the very edge of the known universe. You just happened to be passing when you received this distress call?
SARAH: Well, no, no, no, we were on our way to London, to Earth.
SALAMAR: To Earth? You said you came from Earth.
SARAH: Yes, we do. That is, I do. You see, the Doctor said we could, we could be back
SALAMAR: Report.
MORELLI : Landing site moving to obverse. Decision to land on planet or continue in orbit imperative.
SALAMAR: We'll go in now, before night. I think you and your friend, the Doctor, know much more about Zeta Minor than you want us to think. Take her away. Commence landing procedure.
SORENSON: We'd only been working a few weeks when Lorenzo went. After that, Gura and then Summers. And then for a while, it stopped. We thought that we were safe, that whatever it was had decided to leave us in peace, but it wasn't to be.
VISHINSKY: The killings always happened at night?
SORENSON: Oh, yes. The nights are the worst.
SALAMAR: Naturally. Any force of alien infiltrators is going to operate under cover of dark. A full and immediate confession would save you great discomfort.
DOCTOR: Discomfort? You mean you're going to torture me.
SALAMAR: Interrogate you. And nobody, Doctor, withstands Morestran interrogation for very long. Put him with the other prisoner.
SALAMAR: We must try and contact the home planet again.
VISHINSKY: Not a chance, Controller. This far our, we're on our own.
SALAMAR: Well?
PONTI: We've searched a wide belt of the jungle in all directions. No sign of any other life.
SALAMAR: So that seems to narrow the killer down to our two aliens. Prepare to execute them.
SARAH: Let's go, shall we?
DOCTOR: How?
SARAH: Through the window.
DOCTOR: They're magnetically locked.
SARAH: But the power is low.
Part Two
PONTI: Nothing.
DE HAAN: I heard a scream.
PONTI: Who's the guard on this sector?
DE HAAN: O'Hara. There's no sign of him.
PONTI: Let's get some lights round here.
DE HAAN: Right. I'll go and look for him.
DOCTOR: All right, Sarah, I think it's gone. Are you all right? What's the matter?
SARAH: It's how I felt before, in the jungle. As though I was being drawn from my body.
DOCTOR: You've had a very narrow escape.
SARAH: What was it?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet, but I've got a very unpleasant theory.
SALAMAR: Everything's normal now.
VISHINSKY: Something caused that power drain. There was a temperature drop of four degrees.
PONTI: Controller!
VISHINSKY: Later, Ponti. We have a systems fault.
PONTI: I think the base is under attack, Controller.
SALAMAR: Under attack?
PONTI: We've heard something out there. And O'Hara seems to have disappeared. We need lights.
SALAMAR: Better check the prisoners, Vishinsky.
SALAMAR: As I thought.
VISHINSKY: I'll call the crew to alert.
SARAH: It's as if life was sucked out of him.
DOCTOR: Come on. I think we've been missed.
PONTI: Halt!
VISHINSKY: With the power drain, the magnetic lock must have failed.
SALAMAR: Obviously. But we still don't know what caused it.
SALAMAR: What is it?
PONTI: Something you should see for yourself, Controller. They've killed O'Hara.
SALAMAR: They must be recaptured and made to pay for this.
PONTI: We won't find them in this jungle.
SALAMAR: They won't escape. We'll launch the oculoid tracker at first light.
PONTI: Very good, Controller.
SALAMAR: Get Sorenson. I want him to see this.
VISHINSKY: He's under medicare in the probe.
SALAMAR: Bring him here immediately, Vishinsky. And I want a full bio-analysis on the cause of death.
VISHINSKY: All right.
SARAH: It's so dark.
DOCTOR: Just hang on.
SARAH: What's the matter?
DOCTOR: Nothing.
SARAH: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Shush. Listen. It's coming this way.
SARAH:  That was lucky.
DOCTOR: Fortunately, time is on our side.
SARAH: Time?
DOCTOR: Yes. Night's candles are burned out and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain top. Or something like that.
SARAH: Ah, you mean it's getting light.
DOCTOR: That's what Shakespeare meant.
SARAH: Doesn't it like daylight?
DOCTOR: That is the question.
SARAH: Oh, Doctor, where are you going?
VISHINSKY: Projectile chamber three, ignition procedures activate.
MORELLI : Projectile chamber three activated. Oculoid function normal.
VISHINSKY: Launch attitude seven.
MORELLI : Seven.
VISHINSKY: Telesystems on transverse sweep.
MORELLI : Transverse sweep established.
VISHINSKY: Maintain ocular frequency.
MORELLI : Ocular frequency is transmitting now.
VISHINSKY: Oculoid tracker launched.
SARAH: What was that, an elfin spirit of the forest?
DOCTOR: Some sort of surveillance device.
SARAH: Oh. At least we know we can't get lost.
DOCTOR: No. I met him once, you know.
SARAH: Who?
DOCTOR: Shakespeare. Charming fellow. Dreadful actor.
SARAH: Perhaps that's why he took up writing.
DOCTOR: Perhaps it was.
SALAMAR: You've seen the body?
SORENSON: All my party died the same way. A type of total dehydration.
SALAMAR: I have the bio-analysis here. All the organs are undamaged. No contusions or evidence of pressure. Complete extraction of bodily fluids from tissue.
VISHINSKY: We've no weapon in our technology that could produce such an effect.
SALAMAR: No, a heat weapon would have produced external injuries. All the indications are that some very rapid form of freeze-drying occurred.
SORENSON: Isn't this irrelevant, Controller?
SALAMAR: Irrelevant?
SORENSON: I came to Zeta Minor to prove a theory that could save our civilisation. I've been successful. That's all that matters.
SALAMAR: Seven men have died at the hands of these aliens.
SORENSON: There is more at stake here than seven lives. Our solar system is dependant upon a dying sun. I've discovered a new and inexhaustible source of energy. Rock formations on the fringe of the universe.
MORELLI: Controller, the oculoid tracker has located the prisoners.
SALAMAR: Order out the pursuit party.
PONTI: Right, Controller.
SORENSON: You're wasting time. My mineral samples must be loaded aboard and we must prepare for immediate take off.
SALAMAR: I am well aware of your high position in the science authorities, Professor, but this is a military expedition with military objectives. The manual says hostile alien forces must be searched out and liquidated. That operation is now in hand.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is it.
SARAH: Is this where the thing lives?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't live anywhere. It just is.
SARAH: Uh oh. Doctor.
DOCTOR: Never mind about that. Look down there. What do you see?
SARAH: A pool.
DOCTOR: Look into it. Wouldn't you expect to see a reflection?
SARAH: There's nothing. What do you mean, this is it?
PONTI: Raise your hands over your heads. Search him.
DOCTOR: I can empty my own pockets, thank you.
PONTI: Put your hands over your heads.
DOCTOR: I've nothing up my sleeve, if that's what you mean.
PONTI: Search them both.
DOCTOR: Get back! Didn't you learn anything? You're tampering with the balance of nature on this planet in ways you don't understand. It may already be too late.
SORENSON: I want these canisters loaded carefully.
DE HAAN: What's in them?
SORENSON: Refined ore. Energy. I calculate that six pounds of this material in our own solar system would produce heat equivalent to the output of our own sun over a period of three centuries. Well, don't you understand, man? Full scale exploitation of this planet would provide us with perpetual energy in any quantity whenever we needed it. I've made the greatest discovery in scientific history.
DE HAAN: Do you need any of this other equipment, Professor?
SORENSON: You still don't understand the implications, do you. No, no, there's nothing here. The base can be abandoned.
VISHINSKY: The prisoners have cleared quarantine.
SALAMAR: Any weapons?
VISHINSKY: Our detectors revealed nothing. If they caused the deaths, they used some super-sensory process.
SALAMAR: It's not unknown for aliens to utilise such techniques. Bring them in.
VISHINSKY: Have the aliens brought in.
SALAMAR: Where's Sorenson?
VISHINSKY: Getting his samples aboard preparatory to launching.
SALAMAR: I've given no orders for a launching. There are seven deaths to be accounted for.
VISHINSKY: Sorenson has a lot of authority in high circles, Salamar. It may be unwise to antagonise him.
SALAMAR: He's still a civilian. Military priorities take precedence.
VISHINSKY: Bring the prisoners forward.
DOCTOR: Prisoners? We're here to help. We're not prisoners.
SALAMAR: You are prisoners, and you are charged with diverse acts of war against the subjects of Morestra.
DOCTOR: Not guilty.
SARAH: This is ridiculous.
VISHINSKY: Silence.
DOCTOR: Do you have any idea of what you're up against on this planet?
SALAMAR: You will not respond to questions with counter-questions.
DOCTOR: If you won't allow us
VISHINSKY: Silence! You will have a chance to speak, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
SALAMAR: This interrogation will be conducted in an orderly manner. Failure to comply will result in your immediate execution.
MORELLI: Radioactive reading just within our tolerance. What do they contain?
SORENSON: Mineral elements from the planet.
SALAMAR: Yesterday, you were found with the body of one of our scientists. Last night one of our guards died and you were seen kneeling over him. Can you explain this?
DOCTOR: We had nothing to do with those deaths. They were brought about by your intrusion. Listen, now listen to me, please. Here on Zeta Minor is the boundary between existence as you know it and the other universe, which you just don't understand.
VISHINSKY: Other universe?
DOCTOR: Yes. From the beginning of time, it has existed side by side with the known universe. Each is the antithesis of the other. You call it nothing, a word to cover ignorance, then centuries ago scientists invented another word for it. Antimatter, they called it.
SALAMAR: Nonsense. Clever deception to cover their real motives.
VISHINSKY: I don't think so. Let him finish.
DOCTOR: And you, by coming here, have crossed the boundary into that other universe to plunder it. Dangerous.
SORENSON: Salamar. My mineral samples are aboard. It is getting dark. Prepare for the return journey.
DOCTOR: Mineral samples? Sorenson, you can't take any part of this planet with you.
SORENSON: That was the purpose of my expedition.
DOCTOR: But you can't!
SALAMAR: Get them out of here. I'll deal with them later.
DOCTOR: Sorenson, if you don't listen to me, you'll never leave this planet.
SALAMAR: Now look, Sorenson. I'm aware of your position, but I am in command of this probe and I decide when it takes off. Do you understand?
SORENSON: What did he mean, we'll never leave this planet?
SARAH: Do you ever get tired of being pushed around?
DOCTOR: Frequently.
SARAH: We could get in the Tardis and disappear.
DOCTOR: No, no. It's tempting to let them go ahead and destroy themselves. The trouble is, they wouldn't be the only ones.
SARAH: How do you mean?
DOCTOR: Cataclysm.
SARAH: The Big Bang?
DOCTOR: Yes. The end of the universe.
SARAH: What's that?
DOCTOR: Do you remember the rocks around the pool?
SARAH: Mmm. They were sort of a brownish colour.
DOCTOR: This is a concentrated form.
SARAH: It's changing colour!
SARAH: What are you doing? What are you doing?
DOCTOR: It's just an idea.
SARAH: It's the compression units. They're preparing to launch!
DOCTOR: Fools. Do they really think they'll be allowed to leave with this on board?
VISHINSKY: Pressurisation complete. Cyclostimulators activate.
MORELLI: Activated.
VISHINSKY: Power jets to lock in positions.
MORELLI: Locked.
VISHINSKY: Gyrostabilisers, activate.
MORELLI: Activated.
VISHINSKY: Prepare for final ignition. Ten, nine, eight
MORELLI: Pressurisation falling. Cyclostimulators not responding.
SALAMAR: Activate secondary launch units.
MORELLI: Cycle complete.
VISHINSKY: Secondary launch units activated.
SALAMAR: I don't understand.
VISHINSKY: What's gone wrong?
MORELLI: Emergency power units inoperative. Main and secondary circuits failing.
SALAMAR: Cancel ignition.
VISHINSKY: It doesn't make sense.
SORENSON: Look!
SALAMAR: What is it?
VISHINSKY: It's going to attack the ship!
SORENSON: Energy. Pure energy in physical form. It's incredible!
VISHINSKY: Operate the forcefield barrier.
SALAMAR: Get the alien prisoners up here. I think that thing's got something to do with them.
MORELLI: The barrier won't work. There's not enough power!
SALAMAR: Get out there and stop it.
DOCTOR: You've sent those men to their deaths. Use the forcefield barrier.
VISHINSKY: It won't work.
DOCTOR: Then link it to the atomic accelerator.
MORELLI: It's too dangerous.
DOCTOR: Link the forcefield to the atomic accelerator!
VISHINSKY: We've got to try it, Salamar. Give the order!
SALAMAR: Do it.
MORELLI: Linked.
VISHINSKY: Forcefield barrier.
VISHINSKY: Thank you, Doctor.
SALAMAR: All right, tell us what you know about that.
DOCTOR: Sorenson, you're a scientist. Surely you appreciate the dangers of moving material from one dimension to another.
SORENSON: That was the whole purpose of my expedition.
DOCTOR: You're tampering with hideously dangerous forces.
SALAMAR: But it's gone.
DOCTOR: Yes, for the moment. But while those mineral samples remain on board, it'll always come back.
VISHINSKY: Are you saying we can't take off?
DOCTOR: Unless you abandon those canisters, yes.
SORENSON: But we need those mineral samples.
DOCTOR: Why?
SORENSON: Our sun is dying. By taking material from this planet, we can refuel it and save our civilisation.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that isn't the solution. You must find an alternative energy source.
SALAMAR: So if we jettison those canisters we can take off?
DOCTOR: As long as your intention to leave as you came, empty-handed, is made clear.
VISHINSKY: But how do we communicate that intention?
DOCTOR: Through me. I'm not entirely without influence, but it will take time.
SALAMAR: Very well. But the girl will stay here. You may go.
SORENSON: But
DOCTOR: Alone. I must go alone.
SARAH: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I'll take care.
SALAMAR: Launch the oculoid tracker. I want his movements followed.
DOCTOR: No!
Part Three
SARAH: Doctor! Do something.
SORENSON: There is nothing to be done.
VISHINSKY: He has disappeared into the vortex between this universe and the next.
SARAH: No, not the Doctor! He can't be dead.
SORENSON: He has ceased to exist. Controller, it is nearly night. We must prepare to launch.
SALAMAR: I agree. Vishinsky, see the Professor Sorenson's mineral samples are removed.
SORENSON: No. No, you can't leave those canisters behind.
SALAMAR: Those minerals are endangering the safety of my command. They must be jettisoned.
SORENSON: You arrogant young fool. The whole purpose of your command was to get me and that positron material back to our cosmos.
SALAMAR: So that you can be hailed as the saviour of civilisation? No, Professor. My orders were simply to find your party and get back.
SORENSON: If you abandon that material, you destroy years of my life's work.
SALAMAR: You are a civilian aboard a military vessel. There will be no further argument.
DE HAAN: Half my service I spend flying one way, the other half I spend flying back again. They should pay me for staying in one place.
MORELLI: Come on.
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor.
DOCTOR: Sarah, Vandervelt's equation of knowledge. Quite wrong.
SARAH: Doctor, come on. Come on. The spaceship, it's leaving. Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, wake up. Doctor!
DE HAAN: All the canisters are off the ship, Controller.
SALAMAR: Good. We'll go for immediate take off, Vishinsky.
VISHINSKY: Commence pressurisation and pre-ignition checks.
REIG : Pre-ignition checks commenced.
SALAMAR: Recall the oculoid.
VISHINSKY: Cancel that!
SALAMAR: What?
VISHINSKY: The oculoid picture. Look!
VISHINSKY: Cut the forcefield.
SALAMAR: Are you taking command, Vishinsky?
VISHINSKY: He's alive, Salamar.
SALAMAR: There are higher priorities than recovering corpses.
VISHINSKY: I'm going out for them.
SALAMAR: We must leave this planet before night. Prepare the sick bay.
SORENSON: No.
SORENSON: While still on the surface of Zeta Minor, and within the stable environment of the space probe, positron elements showed a twenty, a twenty percent increase in flux activity. This would seem to indicate a substantially greater, a greater, argh.
VISHINSKY: Electro-function almost non-existent.
SARAH: But he's still alive.
VISHINSKY: Raise the stimulation intensity twelve degrees.
DE HAAN: But that's way over safety margins.
VISHINSKY: Do it!
SARAH: He moved!
DE HAAN: Don't expect too much.
SARAH: What?
DE HAAN: They often move under stimulation. It's the nervous system.
VISHINSKY: He's breathing.
SARAH: He's coming round. Doctor. Doctor?
SALAMAR : Stand by for take off. Vishinsky to command area.
VISHINSKY: He'll be all right. Stay with him.
SARAH: Vishinsky. Thanks for helping us.
MORELLI: Pressurisation complete, Controller.
SALAMAR: Activate cyclostimulators.
MORELLI: Power jets locked in.
SALAMAR: Prepare for ignition. Take the countdown, Vishinsky.
VISHINSKY: If we don't make it this time, we never will.
SARAH: Doctor.
DOCTOR: What's the noise?
SARAH: You're all right. We're taking off.
DOCTOR: What? But the canisters. I promised.
SARAH: It's all right. They've been dumped. Your promise as a Time Lord? Well, what happened?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to explain.
SARAH: Well try. What did you do, enter another universe and have a chat with it?
DOCTOR: I communicated.
SARAH: We seem to be having trouble again.
DOCTOR Oh! Come on.
VISHINSKY: We're not going to make it.
SALAMAR: Activate secondary boosters.
REIG : Secondary boosters activated.
VISHINSKY: The syncronisers are hitting red.
MORELLI: Gravity drag increasing.
SALAMAR: I want ten seconds of maximum fuel burn.
VISHINSKY: That's crazy! You
SALAMAR: You heard me. Ten seconds.
MORELLI: Gravity drag still increasing. Height only thirty miles.
VISHINSKY: That's more than gravity. There's antimatter still aboard!
SALAMAR: All the canisters were removed.
DOCTOR: Except for this.
SALAMAR: What's that?
DOCTOR: Antimatter. How else do you think I survived that pool?
SALAMAR: Is there enough there to hold us back?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SALAMAR: You idiot. Morelli, get that to the jettison hatch fast.
DE HAAN: Hey, Morelli, when are we going to get some lights down here? Do you think the command area's the only place anyone's working?
DE HAAN: Morelli? Morelli!
DE HAAN: Morelli.
REIG: Height, two hundred miles.
VISHINSKY: We're in free space, but we're losing speed again.
SALAMAR: Drag is still increasing. I don't understand it.
DOCTOR: Then I suggest you search the ship.
SALAMAR: Oh? Why?
DOCTOR: Because there must still be antimatter aboard. It's the only explanation.
SALAMAR: Impossible.
VISHINSKY: Salamar, we're burning fuel at thirty units over norm. At this rate we'll never make the stellar systems.
SARAH: But that means we'll be marooned in space!
DOCTOR: If we're not vapourised first.
SALAMAR: Vapourised? What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Antimatter in collision with matter causes radiation annihilation. A release of energy more powerful than nuclear fission.
SALAMAR: There is no antimatter aboard this ship!
DOCTOR: And I tell you there is.
DE HAAN: Controller! Controller, Morelli's dead.
SALAMAR: Dead?
DE HAAN: He's been killed by some sort of an animal.
VISHINSKY: Animal?
DE HAAN: I saw it in sector three.
VISHINSKY: Restore all walkway lights. All right, de Haan, come on. Show us.
SORENSON: It's all gone so wrong.
SORENSON: Yes?
REIG : Report at once to sector three. Controller Salamar wants to see you.
SORENSON: What for?
DOCTOR: Well?
VISHINSKY: The pathology readout is identical to the others. Total dehydration. Even the bone marrow.
SARAH: But how could that thing get on board?
VISHINSKY: I don't know. The forcefield was operating all the time the hatch was open. It was phased to cut in automatically.
DOCTOR: I wonder.
SALAMAR: You're a scientist. You must have formed some theory.
SORENSON: All the deaths appear to have been caused by a technology unknown to us. That would seem to implicate the Doctor and the girl.
SALAMAR: Why?
SORENSON: Well, they're aliens.
SALAMAR: But they were in the command area when Morelli was killed.
SORENSON: That machine in the quarantine berth might contain the answer.
VISHINSKY: Crew records. What denomination was Morelli?
DOCTOR: Can I see the printout?
VISHINSKY: Of course.
REIG : Morelli was Morestran Orthodox.
VISHINSKY: Oh, one of those.
SARAH: What are you doing?
VISHINSKY: Disposal procedure. We may have to play the last rites but we don't have to listen.
VISHINSKY: Another good soldier gone to the greatest army of them all.
SARAH: Out into space to drift forever.
VISHINSKY: It's clean and tidy.
SARAH: It's horrible.
DOCTOR: Vishinsky, I'd like a medical check on everybody aboard the ship.
VISHINSKY: Why?
DOCTOR: Because someone is contaminated.
SALAMAR: Yes, Doctor, and we want to examine that space machine of yours.
DOCTOR: Why?
SALAMAR: We believe you to be responsible for all the deaths. Unless you cooperate, I shall kill you and the girl without compunction.
SARAH: Oh, great. That's the thanks you get for helping people.
DOCTOR: What is all this?
VISHINSKY: The Doctor risked his life on our account.
SALAMAR: That was a ruse to gain our confidence. His real intention is to destroy us.
DOCTOR: Why? For what reason?
SORENSON: There are other civilisations as desperate as we are for new energy sources. My discoveries on Zeta Minor would be of immense value to them.
DOCTOR: Professor Sorenson, has it ever occurred to you that you might be mistaken? That there is no practical method of exploiting antiquark energy?
SORENSON: Oh no, you're wrong. I've spent my life discovering alternative energy.
REIG : Controller Salamar. Calling the Controller.
SALAMAR: What is it, Reig?
REIG : We're in trouble, sir. The ship's stopped moving.
SALAMAR: That's impossible.
REIG: Sir, the progress register has stopped. We're making no headway.
SALAMAR: I'm coming up. Professor, watch the girl. You, come with us.
SARAH: There's no need to. I'm not going to jump out, am I.
SORENSON: What is your friend's field of science?
SARAH: Oh, everything. He's brilliant.
SORENSON: And he's wrong. He has to be wrong. Antiquarks come in three configurations, exactly as I predicted. All my theoretical calculations have proved this! We shall find a way of discovering the energy!
SARAH: All right. I'm not arguing.
VISHINSKY: We're stationary. Suspended in space.
SALAMAR: It's crazy. The thrusters are still at full power.
DOCTOR: The answer's really very simple. You've come to the end of your piece of elastic.
SALAMAR: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: It won't stretch any further. In fact, very soon it will start to pull you back.
SALAMAR: Nothing can do that.
DOCTOR: Antimatter can. There's still some aboard and this proves it.
VISHINSKY: You mean the ship will be dragged back to Zeta Minor?
DOCTOR: Yes, faster and faster. Until, of course, we reach the surface, then we'll stop with a bang. The only way to prevent it is to find the antimatter.
SALAMAR: You're diverting attention from what's really causing the trouble. You! You and whatever's in that machine of yours. Something that's draining the power from this ship.
DOCTOR: Salamar, you're wrong again.
SALAMAR: We'll see. Vishinsky, take charge here.
SORENSON: Antimatter is simply matter composed entirely of antiparticles. Therefore, the hypothetical energy available, available, is, is stupendous.
SARAH: What's wrong? Are you all right?
SORENSON: Yes. Yes, I'm
DE HAAN: Oh, Professor, I
DE HAAN: Argh!
DOCTOR: Usually I only entertain friends in the Tardis.
SALAMAR: Shut up. Open it.
DOCTOR: Externally, as you can see, it resembles a London police box.
SALAMAR: Open it!
DOCTOR : Sarah!
DOCTOR: Sarah, what happened?
SARAH: I caught a glimpse of that thing. It was horrible.
DOCTOR: Antiman.
SARAH: Antiman?
DOCTOR: A hybrid creature running amok.
SALAMAR: Don't move! De Haan. You've killed de Haan!
DOCTOR: Oh, now listen, Sa
SARAH: Doctor!
SALAMAR: No! They killed de Haan.
VISHINSKY: Some thing killed de Haan.
SALAMAR: Let's get rid of them before they kill us all. Take them to the ejector chamber. Hurry!
SALAMAR: Prepare to eject.
SARAH: You can't do this! It's murder!
VISHINSKY: She's right. You have no evidence. You cannot do it.
SALAMAR: How much evidence do you want? The whole crew dead? Eject! Eject.
VISHINSKY: No, Salamar.
Part Four
REIG: Maintain boosters at full thrust. We're only just holding rev. We must avoid being pulled into reverse.
REIG: This is the command deck! Send help! Argh!
REIG : Help! Argh!
SALAMAR: Reig!
VISHINSKY: Reig. If we hadn't been wasting our time down there.
SALAMAR: They caused it all.
VISHINSKY: How could they have caused this? We were with them.  Attention. All crewmen report to assembly point immediately. Red alert! Red alert!
SALAMAR: Countermanded. Only I can give a red alert.
VISHINSKY: It's too late for any more mistakes, Salamar. I'm taking command.
SALAMAR: You'll regret this.
DOCTOR: Where've they gone?
SARAH: I think there's been another killing.
DOCTOR: What?
SARAH: Doctor. Doctor, it is that thing from the planet. I felt it.
DOCTOR: You what?
SARAH: Just before de Haan was killed, I felt the same sort of icy suction.
DOCTOR: Who was with you?
SARAH: Professor Sorenson.
DOCTOR: Sorenson. Of course. The sole survivor of the expedition.
SARAH: So Sorenson is Antiman.
DOCTOR: Yes. He's been infected with antimatter. His brain cells are being destroyed. He'll descend to the level of a brute. Sarah?
SARAH: Yes?
DOCTOR: Get to command deck. Tell them to shut down all the hatches. Our only chance is to keep it isolated.
SARAH: Right. But what are you going to do? Doctor!
DOCTOR: Do as I say.
VISHINSKY: Command area to solarium section. Who's in charge there?
RANJIT : Senior crewleader Ranjit, sir.
VISHINSKY: Ranjit? Good. You know why we're on red alert?
RANJIT : They say we picked up some contagion back on the planet.
VISHINSKY: We picked up something. Some animal. It's killed Morelli, Reig and de Haan, so take no chances. Keep your men on full alert and await further orders.
RANJIT : Right, sir.
SALAMAR: What are you going to do now, Vishinsky? Look at the course monitor. We're heading back to Zeta Minor. Come on, you've taken charge. Give an order. Give an order that'll stop us crashing, or we're all going to die.
VISHINSKY: Keep your nerve, Salamar.
VISHINSKY: Where's the Doctor?
SARAH: I don't know, but he said you've got to close all the hatchways immediately.
VISHINSKY: As soon as Professor Sorenson reports in.
SARAH: No, now! Don't wait for Sorenson. The Doctor says he's behind all this.
SALAMAR: That's insane. How can he be?
SARAH: Something on the planet affected him. Look, you've got to shut the hatchways before it's too late.
SALAMAR: It's another trick.
VISHINSKY: The Doctor's been right so far. We should have listened to him before. Close all section hatchways!
DOCTOR: Keep away!
SARAH: And the antimatter has turned Sorenson into that monster.
VISHINSKY: It's incredible. Sorenson?
VISHINSKY: Salamar!
SALAMAR: Keep away!
VISHINSKY: Don't be a fool.
DOCTOR: Keep away.
SORENSON: I require an explanation.
DOCTOR: Professor Sorenson, you're ill.
SORENSON: What do you mean, ill?
DOCTOR: You think you've discovered an oral vaccine to protect you against antiquark penetration, but you're wrong.
SORENSON: It worked.
DOCTOR: For a time, but it set up a cycle of chemical change. There's no way back, Sorenson. You've reached the point where your tissues are so monstrously hybridised that the next metabolic change could be the final one.
SORENSON: No.
DOCTOR: There isn't much time.
SORENSON: No!
DOCTOR: You and I are scientists, Professor. We buy our privilege to experiment at the cost of total responsibility.
SORENSON: The hypothesis was false.
SALAMAR: Open the hatch!
VISHINSKY: Take the shielding off that neutron accelerator, you'll be dead in minutes.
SALAMAR: But I'll take Sorenson with me. You'd like that, wouldn't you, Vishinsky? That might save your life. You'd like to live?
VISHINSKY: You're out of your mind.
SALAMAR: Oh, no. No, this is leadership. Strong action. That's why I'm Controller. Open that hatch!
SALAMAR: Now, open it!
SARAH: Let him go, Vishinsky. Let him go!
SALAMAR: You, Controller? You haven't a hope.
VISHINSKY: If Sorenson doesn't get him, the radiation will.
VISHINSKY [OC}: Command area calling.
DOCTOR : This is the Doctor.
VISHINSKY: Doctor, we're accelerating back to Zeta Minor. Have you located the antimatter?
DOCTOR: Listen, Vishinsky. Listen. There are now two forces of antimatter aboard. I've got one, and the other one is Sorenson himself.
SARAH: But Salamar's out hunting Sorenson now.
VISHINSKY: With a neutron accelerator.
DOCTOR: He's got to be stopped. How long to impact?
VISHINSKY : Less than thirty minutes.
DOCTOR: Keep the hatchways open.
SALAMAR: Come on! Come on out and face me!
DOCTOR : Salamar!
DOCTOR: Where are you, Salamar? Don't use the accelerator. Salamar!
DOCTOR : Where are you? Salamar! Whatever you do, don't use the accelerator!
DOCTOR : Salamar!
VISHINSKY : Command area.
DOCTOR: Vishinsky, it's too late. Salamar's dead.
DOCTOR : He used the neutron accelerator. If he hit Sorenson, it could be disastrous.
SARAH: You mean things can get worse? I don't believe it.
DOCTOR : Keep the hatches open. I'm coming up.
SARAH: Oh, why is he taking so long?
VISHINSKY: I'll try the quarantine area again. Doctor. Doctor, if you can hear me, indicate your position.
SARAH: Something's happened to him. Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR : Open up, Vishinsky. Open up!
DOCTOR: Shut down all the hatchways. It may hold them.
SARAH: Them?
DOCTOR: Yes, them. They've multiplied.
SARAH: Doctor, look. The hatchways are going.
VISHINSKY: What are they?
DOCTOR: Duplicates of Sorenson. Pure antimatter. The neutron accelerator boosted its power, and the creatures split off and multiplied.
VISHINSKY: They're going towards the solarium chamber. Ranjit, what's happening? Can you hear me?
RANJIT : They're attacking. We need help! They're coming through! Argh!
VISHINSKY: Seven men. Sixteen minutes to impact.
SARAH: How can we stop them?
VISHINSKY: Acceleration thirty STS. Fifteen minutes.
SARAH: Doctor, what are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Stay here with Vishinsky, Sarah. I'm going out now and I may be some time.
VISHINSKY: Acceleration fifty STS. Fourteen minutes.
DOCTOR: Sorenson? Sorenson.
VISHINSKY: Acceleration seventy three STS. Eight minutes.
VISHINSKY: They're all around us. Come on, I'll need your help.
SARAH: We've only six minutes. Where are we going?
VISHINSKY: To get the forcefield equipment. If we can lay a band around the command area we may be able to keep them out.
VISHINSKY: Take that. I'll bring the control box.
VISHINSKY: Back, quickly!
VISHINSKY: Direction them in a line straight across. We'll seal off the area.
SARAH: Look!
VISHINSKY: Thirty seconds. Look, we're slowing down. Twenty five seconds. We've stopped. We're still on full power.
SARAH: We're moving again.
VISHINSKY: We're gaining height! We're moving away from the surface! The Doctor has done it!
SARAH: Yes, but where is he?
DOCTOR: Sorenson. Professor Sorenson.
SORENSON: Where am I? What am I doing here?
DOCTOR: You're a very lucky man, Professor. You've been released.
SORENSON: Released?
DOCTOR: Yes. Because I kept my promise and returned the antimatter.
SORENSON: This isn't the Morestran probe ship.
DOCTOR: Don't you worry, Professor. Just rest a while. Everything's going to be all right.)
VISHINSKY: We're making good progress now. Once we cross the galactic frontier we can signal for an emergency refuelling.
SARAH: Doctor!
VISHINSKY: Professor Sorenson! Are you all right?
SORENSON: Yes. Yes, I remember now. My researches. I've discovered a new source of energy.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, Professor. I think you'd abandoned that line. You'd decided to concentrate on deriving energy from the kinetic force of planetary movement.
SORENSON: Had I?
DOCTOR: Yes. Large source of untapped energy there.
SORENSON: The kinetic force of planetary movement. What a brilliant idea!
SARAH: Goodbye, Vishinsky. And thank you.
(Sarah hugs Vishinsky.
VISHINSKY: Goodbye. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Vishinsky. Come on, Sarah. We've an appointment in London and we're already thirty thousand years late.
