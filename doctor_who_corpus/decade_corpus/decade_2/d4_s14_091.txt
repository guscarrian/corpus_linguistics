The Talons of Weng-Chiang
Part One
JAGO: Mister Chang. Wonderful, wonderful. Words fail me, sir. Words quite fail me.
CHANG: You are most generous.
JAGO: Have I ever, in my thirty years in the halls, seen such a dazzling display of lustrous legerdemain? So many feats of superlative, supernatural skill? The answer must be never, sir. Never.
SIN: Honourable master is kind to bestow praise on humble Chang's miserable, unworthy head.
JAGO: Dashed clever, the way you work the little fellow. Wires in the sleeves, I dare say. But I'll not pry, Mister Chang. The secrets of the artistes are sacrosanct.
BULLER : Hey, you!
JAGO: What the deuce?
BULLER: Where's my Emma? What have you done with her?
JAGO: You've got no right to burst in here.
BULLER: Out of my way! It's him I want.
CHANG: Your Emma?
BULLER: She come in here last night and nobody ain't seen her since.
JAGO: I'll have the fellow ejected.
BULLER: Now I'm asking you, mister, what's happened to her?
JAGO: Call the stage hands, Freddy.
CHANG: It's all right, Mister Jago. Please, come with me.
JAGO: Courteous coves, these Chinese. I'd have propelled him onto the pavement with a punt up the posterior.
CHANG: Your wife?
BULLER: Emma Buller. And don't deny she was here, cos I saw her with my own eyes.
CHANG: Many ladies come to theatre. Why should you think
BULLER: Not round the side door, they don't. Now, look. I was passing in my cab and I saw her plain, and I know it was you she was calling on. She's been acting queer ever since you put the 'fluence on her last week, so don't try coming the innocent, Mister. I want to know where she is or I'm calling the law. Clear?
CHANG: Your wife came on stage?
BULLER: Last week. Levitated her, you did. She's not been the same since. It's done something to her reason, I shouldn't wonder. And she was here last night.
CHANG: Not to see me.
BULLER: Don't come the cod. She's disappeared. Nobody's seen her, not since she come here last night, so what about it, eh?
CHANG: In my country we have saying. Man who goes too quickly may step in bear trap.
BULLER: Right, I'm getting the Peelers.
LEELA: These clothes are ridiculous. Why must I wear them?
DOCTOR : Because you can't go walking around Victorian London in skins. You'll frighten the horses.
DOCTOR: Anyway, we don't want to be conspicuous, do we?
LEELA: A swamp creature. That was it's attack cry.
DOCTOR: Oh no, it was a ship on the river. Excellent. It means we can't be far away.
LEELA: From where?
DOCTOR: From where we're going.
LEELA: Doctor, you make me wear strange clothes, you tell me nothing. You are trying to annoy me.
DOCTOR: I'm trying to teach you, Leela. Surely you'd like to see how your ancestors enjoyed themselves? Splendid. That's why I'm taking you to the theatre. Li H'sen Chang. Hmm, pity. I'd rather hoped we'd catch Little Tich. Never mind. If we hurry we'll just catch the second house.
JAGO: You'd better get your tail pinned on. Linens up in five minutes. Casey, have you got the oopizootics coming on?
CASEY: Mister Jago, I've seen it. I've seen it again!
JAGO: Be quiet. I told you before.
CASEY: Horrible, horrible it was, Mister Jago. A great skull coming at me out of the dark.
JAGO: Damme, you don't want to bankrupt me, Casey. Keep your voice down. Threadbare in Carey Street I'll be if people get the notion there's anything wrong with this theatre.
CASEY: Chains clanking, nine foot tall.
JAGO: You've been drinking.
CASEY: Not a drop, sir.
JAGO: Well, it's time you started.
JAGO: Now pull yourself together, man.
CASEY: I ain't never going down that cellar again. There I was, fixing the trap, when this apparition rose out of the ground in front of me. Hideous, it was. Hideous.
JAGO: That's enough.
JAGO: It's your imagination.
CASEY: Never.
JAGO: A cat or something must be trapped down there making noises. Tell you what I'll do, Casey. I'll come down with you this evening, as soon as the house is clear, and we'll have a good look round. Now how's that?
CASEY: It was no cat, Mister Jago. I seen it!
JAGO: Please, Casey, remember, mum's the word.
LEELA: This is a big village.
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: What's the name of the tribe here?
DOCTOR: Cockneys.
LEELA: The sound of death!
DOCTOR: You stay here.
DOCTOR: Excuse me, can I help you?
QUICK : Hold you there.
QUICK: Now then, what's all this?
LEELA: Touch me and I'll break your arm.
QUICK: Now don't be foolish, miss.
DOCTOR: Good evening.
LEELA: Keep back, Doctor. Blue guards!
DOCTOR: Good evening, Constable.
QUICK: Good evening, sir. You know this young female, sir?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, yes. We were attacked by this little man and four other little men.
QUICK: When I got here, sir, he was being strangled with his own pigtail, sir.
DOCTOR: Really? Girlish enthusiasm, officer?
QUICK: You might call it that, sir. I call it making an affray. I must ask you to come down the station with me.
CHANG: Please to see, ladies and gentlemen, subject now in state of deep hypnosis.
AUDIENCE: Oh!
SIN: She asleep.
CHANG: She not asleep, Mister Sin.
SIN: She been slugging type of toddy.
CHANG: I will prove young lady not asleep.
SIN: She's lying on metal bar.
CHANG: Not lying on metal bar.
SIN: I've seen it done before.
CHANG: I will prove young lady not lying on metal bar.
SIN: She's held up by wires.
CHANG: Enough.
SIN: You can't fool me.
CHANG: Silence!
SIN: Don't touch me! Help! Police! Murder!
CHANG: You see? No wires, Mister Sin. I will now demonstrate art of levitation raising most beautiful lady high above own topknot.
KYLE: Name, sir?
DOCTOR: Doctor. Leela.
KYLE: Place of residence, sir?
LEELA: We've only just arrived here.
DOCTOR: We're on our way to the theatre, do you see.
KYLE: Your home address will do for the moment, sir. You do have a permanent address, sir?
DOCTOR: No, Sergeant. We're travellers.
KYLE: I see. Persons of no fixed abode.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. We do have an abode. It's called a Tardis.
KYLE: A Tardis.
DOCTOR: But it's not fixed.
KYLE: I can give you and the young lady a fixed abode, sir. Quite easily.
DOCTOR: Flat footed imbecile.
KYLE: What was that, sir?
DOCTOR: It was nothing complementary. Get on with it, Sergeant.
KYLE: Now look, sir. We've got our hands full here, all these girls going missing in the manor, so if you'd just oblige us by answering any questions we'll get on a lot better. And a lot quicker.
DOCTOR: Sergeant, all this is irrelevant. I've come here to lay evidence.
KYLE: We'll come to that in good time.
DOCTOR: We'll come to that now, Sergeant. We've just prevented a kidnapping, a robbery or even a murder. My friend here caught one of the attackers. Let's come to it now, shall we?
KYLE: We've only your word as to what he did, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tell him. Tell him.
LEELA: The man they were carrying was dead. He had been stabbed through the heart!
KYLE: Really, Miss. And how can you be sure of that?
LEELA: I am a warrior of the Sevateem. I know the different sounds of death. Now put our prisoner to the torture!
KYLE: Well, if that don't take the biscuit. Torture, eh? This isn't the Dark Ages, you know.
LEELA: Make him talk.
KYLE: He's a Chinese, if you hadn't noticed. We get a lot of those in here, Limehouse being so close. Him jaw-jaw plenty by and by, eh, Johnny? I've sent for an interpreter.
DOCTOR: That won't be necessary. I speak Mandarin, Cantonese, all the dialects.
KYLE: Oh yes?
DOCTOR: Yes. Ne how ma? Ni chi mao cora 
KYLE: Yeah, very remarkable, I'm sure, Doctor, but since you're a party to the case, it isn't proper.
KYLE: Now what? That come from the river.
WOMAN: Look, there it is, guv. See? Look.
QUICK: Hurry with that boat hook.
WOMAN: It's a floater, all right. You've got it, guv.
WOMAN: On my oath, you wouldn't want that served with onions. Never seen anything like it in all my puff. Oh, make an 'orse sick, that would.
KYLE: Good of you to come so prompt, sir.
CHANG: Not at all, Sergeant. I'm always happy to be of service to the police. What can I do for you this time?
KYLE: A complaint against this man, sir. The lady and gentleman here swear they saw him, in concert with others not in custody, carrying what appeared to be a body, sir.
CHANG: Indeed.
KYLE: A European body as I understand them, sir.
CHANG: What happened to the others?
LEELA: They got away. I caught this one.
CHANG: You caught him? Remarkable.
DOCTOR: Don't I know you?
CHANG: I think not.
DOCTOR: Yes, I've seen you somewhere before.
CHANG: I understand we all look the same.
DOCTOR: Are you Chinese? Yes, that's it. We must have. No, I haven't been in China for four hundred years.
CHANG: Are you taking this matter seriously, Sergeant?
KYLE: We are, sir. Will you question the man, sir?
CHANG: Very well.
CHANG: Can I have paper and pencil, please, Sergeant?
KYLE: Certainly, sir.
DOCTOR: Got it! Li H'sen Chang.
CHANG: What?
DOCTOR: The Master of Magic and Mesmerism. Show us a trick.
DOCTOR: Very good. Very good.
KYLE: I think he's dead, sir.
DOCTOR: How did you do it?
CHANG: I did nothing. What are you suggesting.
DOCTOR: Scorpion venom.
KYLE: Scorpion venom?
DOCTOR: Highly concentrated scorpion venom. It killed him almost instantly.
DOCTOR: The Tong of the Black Scorpion.
KYLE: Don't know that one, sir.
DOCTOR: One of the most dangerous politico-criminal organisations in the world. Wouldn't you agree, Li H'sen Chang?
CHANG: You seem remarkably well-informed, Doctor. Alas, I know nothing of these matters. Most regrettable incident. Goodnight, Sergeant.
KYLE: Thank you, sir.
CHANG: I'm sure we shall meet again.
LEELA: Yes.
CHANG: Perhaps under more pleasant circumstances.
KYLE: Well, I don't know what to do about this lot.
DOCTOR: Then I'll tell you what to do, Sergeant. Organise a post-mortem. I want an analysis of the organs.
KYLE: You want what, sir?
DOCTOR: Well naturally I'm going to help. If the Tong of the Black Scorpion's here in London, you're going to need all the help you can get. Now cut along and do as I say. Now!
KYLE: Yes, sir.
CHANG: Faster, man, faster.
JAGO: Twinkle, twinkle, out in front.
CASEY: Eh?
JAGO: Gallery lights still burning.
CASEY: I'll just go and see to them now, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Everyone gone?
CASEY: Aye, just locked up, sir.
JAGO: I hope those girls go straight home to their digs.
CASEY: Oh, that they will, sir, with all this in the papers. Nine are missing now, you know.
JAGO: Nine. There was some fellow in here earlier blaming Chang of all people for some girl's disappearance.
CASEY: Just vanished off the streets, they have. Mostly in this area, too. What do you think's happened to them, Mister Jago?
JAGO: Nothing good, Casey, nothing good. That's a stone certainty.
CASEY: Oh, it says in the paper how it could be jolly Jack at work again.
JAGO: Jolly Jack?
CASEY: The Ripper, Mister Jago.
JAGO: The horrendous hyperbole of Grub Street, Casey.
CASEY: Eh?
JAGO: Newspaper gossip. They're probably just stony and scarpered. Cut along now. I'll wait for you here.
JAGO: I was right. It was blood. Blood all over the hand and wrist. How did that get there?
CASEY: Ready, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Oh, Casey. Don't ever do that to me again. If the celestial Chang caught me trying to pinch his tricks. I had an idea that his dummy was a midget dressed up, but it's just an ordinary vent's doll.
CASEY: Are we going to look down the cellar, Mister Jago?
JAGO: Of course, Casey. Of course. When I promise to do something. Determination, character. After you.
DOCTOR: They're what's known as a very dangerous bunch. Fanatical followers of an ancient Chinese god called Weng-Chiang.
LEELA: The Tong of the Black Scorpion?
DOCTOR: Yes. His followers believe that one day he'll come back and rule the world.
LEELA: So what's he like, this Weng-Chiang?
DOCTOR: Oh, very pleasant company. They say he blew poisonous fumes from his mouth and that he killed men with a white light that shone from his eyes.
LEELA: Magic!
DOCTOR: Superstitious rubbish. Here we are.
QUICK : They're in there now, sir.
QUICK: Taken from the river not half an hour ago. Professor Litefoot's conducting his examination now, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, our case is much more urgent.
QUICK: I wouldn't go in there if I was you, sir.
DOCTOR: Don't you worry about it. Don't you worry.
LITEFOOT: Thank you.
LITEFOOT: Who the devil are you, sir.
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor, come to help you.
LITEFOOT: When I need anyone's help in pathology, I'll ask for it.
DOCTOR: The constable suggested a drowning case.
LITEFOOT: Fished from the river, but he wasn't drowned.
DOCTOR: By the look of those marks, an animal.
LITEFOOT: Exactly what I think, but what kind of animal leaves mutilations like those?
DOCTOR: Chisel-like incisors. A rodent?
LITEFOOT: Yes, but that's impossible. Look at the size of them.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Have you established the cause of death?
LITEFOOT: Yes, that's another curious thing. All this happened after death.
DOCTOR: Really?
LITEFOOT: He was killed by a knife blow to the heart.
DOCTOR: Are those his clothes?
QUICK: Yes, sir. I'm just taking them for examination.
DOCTOR: Hold that.
LITEFOOT: He was carrying no personal documents, but this indicates he was a licensed cab driver.)
LITEFOOT: Easy enough to identify the poor chap by his number.
LEELA: Doctor, those are the clothes the man we saw was wearing.
DOCTOR: What I'd like to know is, what do you think of these?
LITEFOOT: Some sort of hair.
DOCTOR: Yes. I think they're rat hairs.
LITEFOOT: Rat hairs? Do you know what you're saying, man?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I know what I'm saying.
LITEFOOT: But they're nearly three inches long. Hairs on a rat can't be more than what, quarter of an inch?
DOCTOR: Interesting, isn't it, because I've just remembered something else about Weng-Chiang.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: He was the god of abundance. Yes, he made things grow. Can I borrow that?
DOCTOR: Thank you.
LEELA: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Stay there, Leela.
DOCTOR: Were you trying to attract my attention?
DOCTOR: What's this?
LEELA: A Janis thorn.
DOCTOR: Yes. I thought I told you not to carry
LEELA: He was trying to kill you.
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, in that case you'd better come along.
LEELA: What is it?
DOCTOR: The entrance to the sewers.
LEELA: Blood. Is this where they took the body?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: Where's it go?
DOCTOR: Into the Thames eventually. All the sewers are connected.
LEELA: What are those creatures?
DOCTOR: Rats.
LEELA: They don't look very dangerous.
DOCTOR: No, they're not. They're very cunning though. They're probably more afraid of us
Part Two
DOCTOR: Out! Out!
LEELA: We might have been killed!
DOCTOR: It's ten feet from whiskers to tail.
LEELA: We should have taken weapons.
DOCTOR: What kind of weapons? You'd need a harpoon to stop that brute.
LEELA: Shall we tell the blue guards?
DOCTOR: They'd only call a Sanitary Inspector. It's a guard. It's there to keep people away.
LEELA: What? Now where are we going?
CASEY: Ah, it's black as Newgate's knocker down here. It's over this way, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Flickering shadows, Casey. Trick of the light.
CASEY: Shadows don't groan, Mister Jago. Shadows don't clank chains and moan like all the demented souls in hell.
JAGO: There's your ghost. Six-gun Sadie and her Wild West troupe left that behind. All Lombard Street to ninepence, that's what you saw.
CASEY: It weren't that old thing. Anyway, I heard it.
JAGO: Ah, Casey, you're a pixilated leprechaun. The course of the river Fleet runs right under the foundations of this old theatre.
JAGO: What you heard was a clang and the rush of water as they closed the sluice gates down on the Thames.
CASEY: Ah, it's easy for you to cast aspersions, Mister Jago. You weren't down here.
JAGO: Somebody else has been down here by the look of things. Have you got an admirer, Casey?
CASEY: A glove, is it?
JAGO: Yes, a lady's glove, monogrammed EB. Perhaps the ghost dropped it, eh? Come on, we've had enough of your spook.
DOCTOR: No plan of the sewers?
KYLE: We don't keep plans of sewers here, sir, but as far as I know, they all connect to the Fleet and then down to the river. But if you've got any information, sir?
DOCTOR: At the moment, Sergeant, we're looking for information ourselves.
KYLE: Professor Litefoot left a message for you, sir.
DOCTOR: Did he?
KYLE: It says he'd like to see you at the mortuary straight away.
DOCTOR: It does.
KYLE: He's still there, sir. We found another body outside after you'd gone.
DOCTOR: What?
KYLE: Another Chinese, sir, just outside.
DOCTOR: Very convenient.
KYLE: Very mysterious, sir. You wouldn't know anything about it, I suppose?
LEELA: Of course we do. I was rescuing the Doctor
DOCTOR: Come on, Leela!
JAGO: Go on home with you, Casey. Straight home. You might get mistaken for one of those girls.
CASEY: Aren't you coming, Mister Jago?
JAGO: Not yet. Some paperwork commands my presence yet awhile, but I shall doubtless descry those lugubrious liniments at the crepuscular hour.
CASEY: Eh?
JAGO: See you in the morning.
CASEY: You're a card, Mister Jago. A card and a half.
JAGO: Jiminy, you made me jump. I thought you'd gone, Mister Chang.
CHANG: No, Mister Jago, I have come back to see you.
JAGO: See me, Mister Chang? Nothing wrong, I hope?
CHANG: Be so kind as to step up to my dressing room, and I will explain.
JAGO: If it's the terms of our contract, we've been attracting such good houses lately I've already considered drawing up a fresh agreement. The terms I have in mind as such I venture no other management in London would offer an artiste. What would you say to an extra two percent, Mister Chang? Of the gross, naturally. I think you'll agree that's fair.
CHANG: Now hear me, Jago. You remember the cab driver, Buller, who came to see me tonight?
JAGO: Cab driver. Yes.
CHANG: I want you to forget him, understand? You did not see him.
JAGO: I did not see him.
CHANG: Good. Now you will go from here to your office. When you sit down at your desk, you will remember only that you have just said goodnight to Casey. Is that clear?
JAGO: I have just said goodnight to Casey.
CHANG: Excellent. Now, go.
WENG: You are late.
CHANG: We should not go tonight, Lord.
WENG: I must, every night until the time cabinet is found.)
CHANG: You are ill.
WENG: I am dying, Chang. You must bring another linnet to my cage.
CHANG: But only yesterday
WENG: The disease grows worse. Each distillation lasts less than the time before.
CHANG: And with every girl reported missing, panic increases. I fear one of them will be traced here.
WENG: You must be careful.
CHANG: Careful as I am, Lord, there is always risk of discovery. Even tonight I acted quickly to keep our secret. A man was on his way to police.
WENG: Bah. Those dumb-witted oxen. Chang, I have given you mental powers undreamt of in this century. You are thousands of years ahead of your time. What can you fear from these primitives?
CHANG: True, Lord, I read their minds with ease, but tonight there was a stranger, a man whose thoughts were hidden. A man different from all others.
WENG: Describe him.
CHANG: He is a doctor. Tall with wide pale eyes and hair that curls like the ram. He ask many questions.
WENG: A time agent would not ask questions. A time agent would know.
CHANG: But I fear danger, Lord, and have sent a man to kill him.
WENG: Your opium-addicted scum are all bunglers, Chang. You should have seen to it yourself.
CHANG: If he troubles us further, Lord, I will deal with him personally.
WENG: Very well. We're wasting time. Come.
LITEFOOT: I've taken some of the organs for further tests, but I must confess to being beaten.
DOCTOR: Beaten?
LITEFOOT: They were both poisoned, of course. One orally, the other intravenously. I understand you suggested scorpion venom?
DOCTOR: Yes, in concentrated form.
LITEFOOT: I'd like to hear more about that. You're in this line, I take it?
DOCTOR: I've dabbled a bit. Dilettante.
LITEFOOT: Surely more than that. I got a zoologist colleague to look at our last cadaver. It seems he thinks it's the work of a rat, too. What an amazing night it's been.
LEELA: It is not over yet.
LITEFOOT: It's been jolly interesting, wouldn't you say? Most of the corpses around here are jolly dull. Now I've got a couple of inscrutable Chinks and a poor perisher who was chewed by a giant rat, having been stabbed by a midget.
DOCTOR: A midget?
LITEFOOT: Angle of the wound. Oh, upon my soul. I'm sure we shouldn't be discussing such things in front of the fair sex. Forgive us, ma'am.
LEELA: What for?
LITEFOOT: For being so indelicate in the presence of a lady of refinement.
LEELA: Does he mean me?
DOCTOR: I don't think so.
LEELA: It's very interesting. You say you can tell the height of the attacker by the way the blade was thrust? But when aiming for the heart, we were always taught to strike under the breastbone.
LITEFOOT: Upon my soul!
DOCTOR: Savage. Found floating down the Amazon in a hat box.
LITEFOOT: A hat box?
QUICK: Professor, still here? I've traced our cab driver. Name of Joseph Buller, 14 Fish Lane, this parish.
LITEFOOT: Oh, splendid. You can let the coroner have all the details, then. Is there someone to identify the clothing?
QUICK: His mother in law, Mrs Nellie Gusset. Same address. Deceased has lived there since his marriage six month ago.
DOCTOR: Anything else?
QUICK: Sir?
DOCTOR: Well, you had a few drinks with Mrs Gusset. Did she tell you anything further about the deceased?
QUICK: A bearer of sad tidings, sir. I shared a glass or two while the poor thing got over the shock. Yes, well, she did mention the deceased had been in a queer state all day.
DOCTOR: Why?
QUICK: Well, it seems his wife, that's Emma Buller, daughter of the house, didn't come home last night. Deceased refused to take his cab out today as a consequence. Deceased then had several drinks and went round the Palace Theatre.
LITEFOOT: The theatre?
QUICK: Oh, not on pleasure bent, sir. It seems he believed that's where his wife was to be found. Mrs Gusset says he went off making horrible asseverations as to his intentions.
LITEFOOT: Yes, well, er, put as much in that report as you think will concern the coroner, officer. It's quite clear the man got stupidly drunk and picked a fight with a dwarf.
QUICK: Yes, sir.
LITEFOOT: A night's work like that always does wonders for my appetite. I'd be honoured if you'd share some supper with me.
DOCTOR: I'd be delighted, Professor.
LITEFOOT: Of course, the police will have the Buller case cleared up in no time, but the Chinese, different kettle of fish, what?
LEELA: Why are you making fire in your mouth?
LITEFOOT: Why am I? Upon my sam. Hasn't the girl seen a pipe before?
DOCTOR: There's no tobacco where Leela comes from.
LITEFOOT: Sounds healthy, but exceedingly dull. Yes, as I was saying, they're a mysterious lot, the Chinese. Enigmatic. I never got anywhere near to understanding them, and I was brought up in China.
DOCTOR: Really? What were you doing there?
LITEFOOT: My father was Brigadier General in the punitive expedition of 1860. Afterwards he stayed in Peking as a palace attach�. Died there in the end, poor old buffer. Fireworks at the funeral. Odd custom. Odd sort of people.
LITEFOOT: What's up?
DOCTOR: They use fireworks to frighten off evil spirits.
LITEFOOT: I know that. Where are you going?
DOCTOR: You stay with Litefoot. I'll join you later. Drive on, cabbie.
LITEFOOT: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Palace theatre.
LITEFOOT: There'll be nobody there at this hour!
LITEFOOT: Extraordinary. I say, how can he join us later? I haven't given him m'card.
LEELA: Four Ranskill Gardens. He heard you tell the driver.
LITEFOOT: Gad, he's as sharp as a trout.
LEELA: Trout?
JAGO: All right. Coming!
JAGO: Yes?
DOCTOR: Terrible weather for the time of the year.
JAGO: The theatre's closed.
DOCTOR: Shush.
JAGO: What do you want?
DOCTOR: Are you the manager?
JAGO: I'm the owner, sir. Henry Gordon Jago at the end of a long day, so if you'd kindly state your business.
DOCTOR: Henry Gordon Jago, how do you do, sir. I'm the Doctor.
JAGO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
JAGO: Ah, now I've rumbled your game. I admire your brass, but it won't do. Call back on Saturday.
DOCTOR: Don't move. Hold that.
JAGO: Auditions commence at ten o'clock sharp. Supporting acts booked for one week only.
JAGO: Is that all?
DOCTOR: No. Dramatic recitations, singing, tap-dancing. I can play the Trumpet Voluntary in a bowl of live goldfish.
JAGO: Don't bother coming back on Saturday.
DOCTOR: I'm also a master hypnotist. Now then.
DOCTOR: How long since you were under the influence, sir?
JAGO: I'm a man of character and determination, sir. The Rock of Gibraltar would be more easily, more easily.
DOCTOR: Just as I thought, and quite recently, too. What was your last order?
JAGO: To remember nothing since I said goodnight to Casey.
DOCTOR: Henry Gordon Jago, I command you to remember everything you were ordered to forget. When I count to three, you will remember everything. One, two, three.
JAGO: More easily influenced than I would. I have a will of iron. What the Dickens am I talking about?
DOCTOR: Did a cab driver come here tonight?
JAGO: Yes, there was a fellow burst in and accosted Mister Chang between shows.
DOCTOR: What did he want?
JAGO: Something about his Emma. Lady friends, no doubt.
DOCTOR: Emma Buller, his wife. She disappeared last night. Does Mister Chang by any chance do a vanishing lady act?
JAGO: You're not by any chance suggesting that Mister Chang has anything to do with these missing
DOCTOR: What is it?
JAGO: Emma Buller.
DOCTOR: EB. Where did you find this?
JAGO: In the cellar. Are you from the police?
DOCTOR: I'm helping them. I'd like to see this cellar, Mister Jago.
WENG: You are certain these are different streets?
CHANG: The driver has his orders. Every night we quarter a new sector.
WENG: For how much longer?
CHANG: Patience, Lord. We know the time cabinet is here. The cabinet of Weng-Chiang in the house of an infidel. We shall recover it.
WENG: I grow weary, Chang.
CHANG: Tomorrow I bring you two donors. Young, plump, high-spirited girls. The distillation of their life essences will recover your powers, Lord.
JAGO: It was over here. Here, this is where it was, down here.
DOCTOR: What were you doing down here?
JAGO: I was reassuring Casey
DOCTOR: Who?
JAGO: My factotum. He's taken to seeing ghosts lately. He's a good fellow, Casey, but about as sharp as the corners of a round table. Great Jumping Jehosophat! What a spider! That must be the granddaddy of them all.
DOCTOR: It's a money spider.
JAGO: A money spider?
DOCTOR: Yes.
JAGO: Don't kill it.
DOCTOR: Genetic disruption. Where does it come from? What's under here?
JAGO: You mean right where we're standing?
DOCTOR: Yes.
JAGO: Well, they say the course of the River Fleet runs right
DOCTOR: Fleet?
JAGO: Yes, the River Fleet runs right under these foundations.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We're getting somewhere.
LITEFOOT: Ah, now, let's see what we have here. Mrs Hudson always leaves me a cold collation.
LITEFOOT: Ham, roast beef, chicken, tongue. Those look like quail, unless I'm much mistaken.
LEELA: Meat.
LITEFOOT: Yes, well, perhaps we shouldn't wait for your friend the Doctor. Help yourself, my dear. Plates on the end of the table. I'll, er, I'll just put a log or two on the fire.
LEELA: It's good.
LITEFOOT: Oh, I'm so glad.
LEELA: Is something wrong?
LITEFOOT: No, no. Would you care for a knife or a fork?
LEELA: It's a good knife. Aren't you going to eat?
LITEFOOT: Yes, yes.
LITEFOOT: Just going to eat.
WENG: Stop! Stop! Somewhere here. Somewhere! One of these dwellings!)
WENG: This is the place, Chang. The time cabinet is in there.
CHANG: Leave the rest to your servants, Lord. Go back to your abode.
WENG: I must have the time  cabinet.
CHANG: Lord, your weakness grows. Go, go back. Rest. I will bring the cabinet to you.
WENG: Very well, but do not fail me now, Chang.
DOCTOR: Well, if there is a secret entrance, it's expertly hidden.
DOCTOR: How very interesting.
DOCTOR: Do you know what this is? Oh, come on, Rock of Gibraltar.
LITEFOOT: Great Scott!
LEELA: What is it?
LITEFOOT: There's somebody out there watching the house.
LEELA: Where?
LITEFOOT: Someone stepped back into the shrubbery as I looked out.
LITEFOOT: Some scoundrel up to no good. Odd thing. I could swear he was a Chinese. Well, whoever he is, I'll give him more than he expected. No, you wait here.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling?
JAGO: The ghost! I saw it. Casey, forgive me.
DOCTOR: No.
JAGO: I saw it.
DOCTOR: It was a hologram.
JAGO: I always thought there was something unnatural about that cellar.
DOCTOR: There's nothing unnatural about the holograph technique. Projection of light by a laser beam.
JAGO: What?
DOCTOR: Don't worry. It wasn't known in this century.
DOCTOR: Drink this. Go on, you'll feel better.
JAGO: What's that?
DOCTOR: Shush.
JAGO: Oh, oh Doctor.
DOCTOR: Cheer up, Jago, cheer up.
DOCTOR: He's gone back to his rats. Are you all right.
JAGO: Yes, I think so. Who the devil was it?
DOCTOR: I've no idea. He didn't introduce himself.
JAGO: Shall I call in the local police?
DOCTOR: Oh, Henry Gordon Jago. Then our reclusive phantom would simply vanish, poof!
JAGO: Oh, good heavens, yes.
DOCTOR: We can tackle it together, you and I.
JAGO: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Think. I'm going to have some supper.
JAGO: Ah.
LITEFOOT : Nobody out there now. Fellow must have got wind of
LEELA: Professor? Are you there? Professor!
Part Three
LEELA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Shush.
LEELA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Shush.
LEELA: Doctor.
CHANG: Sin!
DOCTOR: Where's Litefoot?
LEELA: He went out. He said he'd seen a Chinaman outside the window.
DOCTOR: And you jumped through it.
LEELA: Something like that.
DOCTOR: Stay here.
DOCTOR: Leela! Leela, no! Don't! Leela.
DOCTOR: Ice!
LITEFOOT: The sheer criminal effrontery. Things are coming to a pretty pass when ruffians will attack a man in his own home.)
DOCTOR: Well, they were Chinese ruffians.
LITEFOOT: I wonder what they intended?
DOCTOR: Robbery?
LITEFOOT: Well, there are some pretty valuable things here. That K'ang-hsi vase, for instance. My family brought that back from Peking. Or that Chinese puzzle box.
LITEFOOT: It doesn't open. Chap spent a week here once looking for a secret spring.
DOCTOR: Fused molecules.
LITEFOOT: No, no, no, no. Lacquered bronze.
DOCTOR: It's extraordinary. It's from this planet.
LITEFOOT: A parting gift from the Emperor.
DOCTOR: Technology this advanced? Ah! Got it! Well, of course, that's the answer.
LITEFOOT: What the Dickens are you raving about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Weng-Chiang.
LITEFOOT: Weng-Chiang?
DOCTOR: Weng-Chiang. I do hope that girl Leela isn't in danger.
WENG : You will explain yourself, Li H'sen.
WENG: I will not tolerate failure!
CHANG: There has been no failure, Lord.
WENG: Then where is the time cabinet?
CHANG: The house is marked. When night returns, my brothers in the band of death will strike.
WENG: I put no trust in your dockyard riff-raff.
CHANG: Lord, for your glory they would die willingly.
WENG: Opium sodden scum. Strike!
CHANG: Lord, I promise you will have the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang before another dawn.
WENG: I had better. I grow weary of this hole in the ground.
CHANG: You are safe here, Lord.
WENG: Safe? It is a trap, and I was seen returning to it.
CHANG: Tonight?
WENG: Yes, and now he knows where I am, he will be back.
CHANG: Who?
WENG: By your description, the one you have already failed to kill.
CHANG: The Doctor! I knew he was a danger.
WENG: Listen, Li H'sen.
WENG: The beasts of darkness. I have made them larger and more savage than lions! Yes, yes, the Doctor is a danger, and he was brought to my door by your blundering. You see what it means, Li H'sen?
CHANG: He will die.
WENG: The list of your failures is growing. I must be ready to move quickly. I need strength.
CHANG: I will bring a girl, Lord.
WENG: One will not be enough this time. I need two fresh young donors, and I need them at once.
CHANG: It is not easy at this hour, Lord.
WENG: No excuses! Get them!
CHANG: Yes, Lord.
LITEFOOT: Haven't you slept?
DOCTOR: Sleep is for tortoises.
LITEFOOT: Any news of Miss Leela?
DOCTOR: Not yet.
LITEFOOT: Perhaps we should inform the police?
DOCTOR: No, there are already nine missing girls on their list.
LITEFOOT: Oh yes, but surely missing under very different circumstances.
DOCTOR: No. If my suspicions are correct, then I know what those poor girls were used for, and I can't imagine a more grisly fate. He's a blackguard.
LITEFOOT: Who's a blackguard?
DOCTOR: I don't know who's a blackguard. Some slavering gangrenous vampire comes out of a sewer and stalks this city at night, he's a blackguard. I've got to find his lair and I haven't got an hour to loose. Look. You see? I've been trying to trace the line of the sewers. That's the Thames, this is the line of the Fleet, and that is the Palace Theatre.
LITEFOOT: I'm beginning to see what you're getting at.
DOCTOR: Good. Good.
LITEFOOT: Yes, well, er, if you've finished with the tablecloth, I think I'd better dispose of that before my housekeeper arrives.
DOCTOR: Right.
LITEFOOT: How'd you know the course of the Fleet? It's been covered for centuries.
DOCTOR: I caught a salmon there once. Would have hung over the sides of this table. Shared it with the Venerable Bede. He adored fish.
DOCTOR: Professor, you don't happen to have an elephant gun, do you?
LITEFOOT: Elephants? Why on Earth do you want an elephant gun?
DOCTOR: We're about to embark on a very dangerous mission.
LITEFOOT: Well, I've a Chinese fowling piece if that's any good. Used for duck, mainly.
DOCTOR: Made in Birmingham. Yes, that's the main requirement. Could you get me a small boat?
LITEFOOT: I imagine so. May I ask the purpose of these preparations?
DOCTOR: Yes. To find the confluence of the Thames and Fleet, Professor, then to follow the Fleet.
LITEFOOT: And then?
DOCTOR: Oh, and then we shall see.
TERESA: Ta, ducks.
TERESA: Oh!
CHANG: Pleasant are the dreams of morning.
TERESA: You gave me a turn, dearie.
CHANG: Fresh as dew and bright with promise.
TERESA: Yeah, well, that's how you might see it, Mister Ching-ching, but as far as I'm concerned all I want is a pair of smoked kippers, a cup of rosie and put me plates up for a few hours, savvy?
CHANG: Budding lotus of the dawn, despicable Chang has other ideas.
TERESA: Well, I can tell you what to do with your ideas.
CHANG: You will come with me.
CHANG: Await my return.
CHANG: Come. I said come!
CHANG: Come, you painted drabs. My master must feed.
DOCTOR: There it is, fifty yards ahead.
LITEFOOT: Sit down, Doctor. The man knows these waters.
DOCTOR: I've always enjoyed messing about in boats.
LITEFOOT: I think this entire enterprise is extremely rash and ill-considered.
DOCTOR: My dear Litefoot, I've got a lantern and a pair of waders, and possibly the most fearsome piece of hand artillery in all England. What could possibly go wrong?
LITEFOOT: Well, that for a start. It hasn't been fired for fifty years. If you try to use it, it'll probably explode in your face.
DOCTOR: Explode? Unthinkable. It was made in Birmingham. Tie up over there, skipper.
CHANG: You will hear the commands of my master, Weng-Chiang, and obey.
WENG: Where did you get them?
CHANG: Are they unsuitable, Lord?
WENG: They're not the best, but they'll do. They're young. Their life essence is still strong. Oh, this one has muscles like a horse!
CHANG: I took what I could find, Lord.
WENG: I have given you knowledge. I have made you a leader among your fellows. All I have asked for in return is a few contemptible slatterns who will never be missed.
CHANG: But they are missed, Lord. And because your need is so great, I've been forced to move unwisely.
WENG: Unwisely?
CHANG: I took this one from the rooms above. Nobody saw, but it will bring the police even nearer.
WENG: It is of no consequence. Once I have the time cabinet, I can move from here. Now put this one in the distillation chamber.
CHANG: Yes, Lord.
WENG: Leave me to my work.  I shall not keep you waiting long.
LITEFOOT : All right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: All right, Professor.
LITEFOOT : I'll wait for you for two hours, then.
DOCTOR: Yes, no more. If I'm still in here at high tide.
LITEFOOT : Yes?
DOCTOR: Don't bother.
LITEFOOT : Oh. Well, good luck!
WENG: When my beauties find her, she will wish she had died here!
CASEY: Hey, you. What's your business here?
WHORE: Business? Where the devil am I?
CASEY: Oh, you wouldn't be knowing.
WHORE: What happened to me last night? Can't remember a thing.
CASEY: Look, if there's anything missing, I'll remember you sure enough. Now you come on, get on out of here.
WHORE: Get your hands off of me! I'm a lady.
JAGO: What's the trouble, Casey?
CASEY: No trouble, Mister Jago. I'm just seeing this lady off the premises.
WHORE: Oh, my lord. It was him! It was him!
JAGO: Mister Chang? What are you talking about?
WHORE: Quick, let me out of this place! Let me go!
JAGO: Another case of the screaming oopizootics. I'll bear that in mind.
CASEY: What?
JAGO: It might have some relevance to the matter in hand.
CASEY: What matter?
JAGO: The investigation, Casey. These missing females. I've made the acquaintance of a very high-up gentleman, an amateur investigator who's been called in personally by the Yard. Scotland Yard. And I am assisting him.
CASEY: No.
JAGO: I am. He told me to watch, Casey, and I am watching, everywhere.
WENG: You incompetent fool! She was a tigress!
CHANG: She substituted herself for the woman I had found. The police must be closing in.
WENG: My rats will dispose of her, but you, Li H'sen, have made too many mistakes.
CHANG: That girl. She was with the doctor. It is not the police, it is he who sent her.
WENG: Vacant excuses. You have failed me! You know that until I have the time cabinet, I can never be whole again, never escape from this hideous condition. Yet knowing this, you still failed me.
CHANG: Lord, hear me. I would lay down my life in your service.
WENG: You are dismissed, Li H'sen. I can no longer leave my fate in your blundering hands.
CHANG: Great one, let me find this doctor. Let me strike him down for the harm he has done you.
WENG: Do not beg. You have proved unworthy. Go!
CHANG: I await your commands, Lord.
WENG: Go!
Part Four
DOCTOR: Leela? Leela, are you all right?
LEELA: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Yes, I'm all right, just bruised.
DOCTOR: You were lucky.
LEELA: I deserve death. I had the chance to kill our enemy, Doctor, and I failed.
DOCTOR: Which enemy?
LEELA: The yellow one calls him lord. He lives in a cave beneath the theatre. Come, I will show you.
DOCTOR: This gun takes about half an hour to load. Let's go this way.
JAGO: Casey, I'm about to repair for half a foot of port. Mrs Samuelson in yet?
CASEY: I've not seen her, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Well, you tell her I want the girl's frillies smartening up. They looked like a fit-up company last night. One of them had a Jacob's ladder as long as my arm. Look at that. You tell her.
CASEY: Yes, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Oh, Mister Chang. Back again already? I shall have to start charging you rent, what?
CHANG: There are many things to prepare before the performance.
JAGO: Of course, Mister Chang. Yes. The art that conceals, eh? Tell me, last night.
CHANG: Last night?
JAGO: I'm working too hard. Too much in the old brain box, that's a fact, but, er. We talked about a new contract but I've quite forgotten how we left matters.
CHANG: I'm considering your new offer.
JAGO: Ah, I see. Splendid. Generous offer?
CHANG: Merely reasonable. Tonight, incidentally, I shall be appearing without Mister Sin.
JAGO: Oh, why is that? Just making a change?
CHANG: Mister Sin is indisposed.
JAGO: Ha, ha, very droll. I shall treasure that exceedingly humorous jest, Mister Chang. Oh, Mister Chang? I suppose the little fellow's got a touch of woodworm, what?
DOCTOR: Say that again?
LEELA: Hmm?
DOCTOR: Say that again.
LEELA: She was dead. Her skin was dry like old leaves. It was something the machine did to her.
DOCTOR: Like old leaves. Sounds like an organic distillation. Drained out the life essence.
LEELA: That's what he called it.
DOCTOR: Did he?
LEELA: Well, he seemed to know what he was talking about.
DOCTOR: Well, he doesn't. He's a madman.
LITEFOOT: Here we are. Your outfit, my dear.
LEELA: Oh, thank you, Professor.
LITEFOOT: No, no, not here. Mrs Hudson's waiting upstairs. She'll help you change. Hope it's suitable.
LITEFOOT: Dashed embarrassing business, eh? Never done it before.
DOCTOR: What?
LITEFOOT: Chosen togs for a girl.
DOCTOR: Ah.
LITEFOOT: Quite apart from the rum things they wear, you have to be jolly careful it's in the right fashion. Clothes matter to women.
DOCTOR: They do?
LITEFOOT: Still trying to open it, are you?
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm trying to place the period. It can only be opened by a key of the correct molecular combination.
LITEFOOT: Is that a fact?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LITEFOOT: What were you saying when I came in? Something about a madman?
DOCTOR: Yes, he's probably got the key.
LITEFOOT: Who?
DOCTOR: Well, presumably he's calling himself Weng-Chiang.
LITEFOOT: Weng-Chiang was one of the ancient Chinese gods.
DOCTOR: I know that, Professor, I know. And he probably arrived in this contraption.
LITEFOOT: It was a gift to Mama from his highness, T'ung-Chi. We came home in seventy three, so it's been in the family quite some years now.
DOCTOR: Then you're very lucky, Professor, that he hasn't traced it before now.
LITEFOOT: Weng-Chiang?
DOCTOR: Weng
LEELA: Do you like it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's charming. Isn't it charming, Professor?
LITEFOOT: Quite delightful.
DOCTOR: I'll be proud to take to take you to the theatre looking like that.
LEELA: We're going to the theatre?
DOCTOR: I have an appointment at the Palace Theatre tonight, and if you're very good, I'll buy you an orange.
CASEY: Told her.
JAGO: What?
CASEY: Mrs Samuelson. I told her what you said.
JAGO: Oh.
CASEY: She didn't like it.
JAGO: I don't need to hear that, Casey. I'm not concerned with what Mrs Samuelson likes.
CASEY: She mentioned money matters. She wants a word with you.
JAGO: The woman's a bloodsucker. She's trying to ruin me.
CASEY: Well she said
JAGO: Don't tell me, Casey. I'm an artiste. Every night at this time, I feel like an old warhorse scenting the smoke of the battlefield. As the house fills, the blood starts tingling through my veins. My public is out there waiting for me. I can't talk about money at a time like this.
CASEY: But you don't do anything, Mister Jago.
JAGO: I, I announce the acts, I count the tickets, I smile at people. You've no idea of the strain it puts on a fellow. Furthermore, she spend seventeen and threepence on the wardrobe last week. Any sign of the Doctor yet?
CASEY: Who?
JAGO: My collaborator and fellow sleuth. Oh well, he'll be here tonight keeping observation, Casey.
JAGO : I'll lay a guinea to a gooseberry on it.
LITEFOOT: Your cab's here.
DOCTOR: Good.
LITEFOOT: You'll need your coats. It's getting thick again.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Did you pass word to the police?
LITEFOOT: Oh, yes, yes. They've posted a man outside.
DOCTOR: Good. Lock and bolt the door after us and keep your gun handy. Come on.
LITEFOOT: What, you really think those scoundrels will come back?
DOCTOR: They might. They might. They'll do anything to get their hands on that cabinet.
LITEFOOT: Don't you worry, Doctor. By shots, I'll be ready for them. They won't catch George Litefoot napping a second time.
DOCTOR: Palace Theatre, cabbie. Make it snappy.
CABBIE: Go on, get up.
WENG: What is it?
CHANG: Your servant, master.
WENG : Go away. I have work to attend to.
CHANG: Lord, I have heard that the strange infidel, the Doctor, will be here soon. Is it still your wish that I should kill him?
WENG: I think it more likely that he will kill you.
CHANG: No, Lord. I have plan. I will kill him as sacrifice to appease the wrath of my god Weng-Chiang, to prove that I above all others am your true servant.
WENG: You no longer serve me, Li H'sen. I shall take my own measures. You do what you will. Now go!
JAGO: You owe me a gooseberry, Casey. There he is, in the box. See?
CASEY: He don't look like a detective to me.
JAGO: Well, he's not going to wear a brown derby and boots, is he, secret investigator like him, a man of a thousand faces.
CASEY: Who's the girl?
JAGO: Window dressing. Part of his disguise. Tell you what, I think I'll just pop up and tell him we're all on the q v down here. Have you set the star trap yet?
CASEY: Not yet, Mister Jago.
JAGO: You'd better get on with it, hadn't you, unless you want to ruin Mister Chang's act for him.
CASEY: It's that cellar, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Psst.
DOCTOR: Good evening, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Pleasure to welcome you, sir, and your charming companion.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Are you quite comfortable down there?
JAGO: Oh, I know the value of discretion in matters like this, Doctor. May I ask if you've come to any further deductions?
DOCTOR: Oh, quite a few, quite a few.
JAGO: Ah. I thought as much when I saw you here. I take it you're on the point of solving the mystery of the missing girls.
DOCTOR: I'm expecting further developments very soon, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Ah. Well, if you need any help, Doctor, I hope I know where my duty lies.
DOCTOR: I knew I could rely on you.
JAGO: Oh, to the limit, though I suppose you've got your own men scattered throughout the audience.
DOCTOR: No.
JAGO: No? You mean nobody?
DOCTOR: Nobody. When the moment comes, Mister Jago, you and I can face our destiny shoulder to shoulder.
JAGO: Oh, corks.
LETTIE: Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer, do. I'm half crazy all for the love of you. It won't be a stylish marriage. I can't afford a carriage. But you'll look sweet on the seat of a bicycle build for two. Everybody now!
ALL: Daisy, Daisy.
LEELA: Do we need to give the responses?
DOCTOR: There's no obligation.
ALL: I'm half crazy
LEELA: When shall we go and look for the cave creature?
DOCTOR: Perhaps it'll come looking for us.
CASEY: No. No!
JAGO: The Sheffield song thrush. Last time she was here, there were eggs all over the stage. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege to introduce to you, in his extended season here at the Palace, the first of two appearances this evening, someone whose legendary legerdemain has entranced and entertained all the crowned heads of Europe. Here to baffle and bewilder in his eclectic extravaganza of efflorescent ectoplasm, that master magician from the Orient, Li H'sen Chang!
CHANG: First trick very simple.
CHANG: Next trick very simple.
CHANG: Will someone pick cards, please? You sir. Catchee.
CHANG: Now, sir, please to assist humble Chang by selecting any card. Ace of diamonds. Please to hold card in air so everyone see. Now, sir, please to return card to pack, any place. Honourable gentleman please to hold pack of playing cards between finger and thumb. Chang will now shoot magic bullet through ace of diamonds without hitting other cards. Please to keep very still.
LEELA: Doctor!
CHANG: Please to keep very quiet. Chang shoot fifteen peasants learning this trick.
CHANG: Now, sir, please look for ace of diamonds.
DOCTOR: Oh, very good, very good! Wasn't that good? Anything else?
CHANG: Honourable gentleman please to bring cards to stage. I have further demonstration requiring nerves of steel.
CHANG: I will now ask my eager volunteer kindly to step into the Cabinet of Death.
CHANG: The bird has flown. One of us is yellow.
CHANG: If you will now pay close attention, ladies and gentlemen.
WENG: So, the great magician.
CHANG: In my country, this is known as the death of a thousand cuts.
CHANG: I will now ask my new volunteer kindly to assist in opening cabinet.
JAGO: The curtain! Quick, drop the curtain! What happened?
DOCTOR: He's dead. He died of a fright.
JAGO: Poor Casey. He's worked here for years.
LEELA: Doctor, what happened? Did Chang kill him?
DOCTOR: No, Chang was as surprised as anyone. Where's he gone?
CHANG: Are you here, Master? This is your servant, Li H'sen.
CHANG: Answer me, Lord. If you're here, answer me. He has gone. Weng-Chiang, lord of greatness, has deserted me.
CHANG: Lord?
DOCTOR: You've been left to carry the can, Chang.
DOCTOR: No poison tonight. There are questions to answer.
CHANG: I will say nothing. It is time for me to join my forefathers.
DOCTOR: Well, as an accomplice to murder, the police shouldn't hold you up long. Tell me about Weng-Chiang. Where did he go?
CHANG: Perhaps back to his great palace in the sky. I failed him. He was displeased with me.
LEELA: His mind is broken.
DOCTOR: Li H'sen, you know he's not a god, don't you.
CHANG: He came like a god. He appeared in a blazing cabinet of fire. I saw him and helped him. He was tired from his journey.
DOCTOR: Go on.
CHANG: He was ill for many months. I was but a humble peasant, but I gave him sanctuary while the soldiers searched. I nursed him.
DOCTOR: The cabinet. What happened to the cabinet?
CHANG: Soldiers of T'ung-Chi took it. Ever since, we have searched for the great cabinet of Weng-Chiang. The god will not be made whole until it is recovered.
JAGO: Doctor, are you down here? Well, cover me in creosote. I never knew this was here.
LEELA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Not this time, Leela.
LEELA: But he's escaping!
DOCTOR: There's no escape that way. He's gone to join his ancestors.
JAGO: You mean to say the celestial Chang was involved in all these Machiavellian machinations?
DOCTOR: Yes, up to his epicanthic eyebrows.
JAGO: Well, I'll go to Australia.
JAGO: What in the name of heaven's that?
DOCTOR: You'll have to book yourself a new act tomorrow. Cyanide gas might do for the brutes, though you'd have to shut the sewers off for a day or two.
LEELA: Look at this, Doctor. This is all that's left of them.
JAGO: Of the missing girls? So it was Chang.
DOCTOR: Not Chang. His master, the crazed maniac who organised all this.
LEELA: Doctor! The machine's gone.
DOCTOR: That means he's going to start up all over again somewhere else.
LEELA: He could be anywhere. We'll have to look for him.
DOCTOR: With his DNA helixes split open, the more cells he absorbs into himself, the more deformed he becomes.
LEELA: You mean he is like a waterbag with a hole in the bottom, and the hole is getting bigger?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LEELA: What happened to make him like that?
DOCTOR: Perhaps because he used the cabinet. A dangerous experiment in time travel. Now he'll be struggling to keep his metabolism in balance.
LEELA: And the rats?
DOCTOR: Just an experiment. He had to gauge the strength of the psionic amplification field. The rats were handy. After that, they were useful as sewer guards.
JAGO: I've got it! See the lair of the phantom. Conducted tours, bob a nob. I'm on to a fortune here. Hey, Doctor, you're not going, are you?
DOCTOR: I must. Things to do.  We've got to get back to that time cabinet. Come on.
Part Five
LEELA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Litefoot's got visitors.
DOCTOR: Mi how ma! What happened?
LITEFOOT: Chinese. Dozens of them.
DOCTOR: What?
LITEFOOT: Oh, the devils.
DOCTOR: Well, they got what they came for.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: The time cabinet.
LITEFOOT: Damn scoundrels.
DOCTOR: Get him a drink.
DOCTOR: In a glass. In a glass. Professor, how did they get in?
LITEFOOT: I've, I've no idea. I locked and bolted all the doors as soon as you left. Thank you, my dear.
DOCTOR: Were they all Chinese?
LITEFOOT: Tong-wallahs. Criminals. The gutter scrapings of Shanghai.
DOCTOR: And one midget.
LITEFOOT: Yes. My dear Doctor, how on Earth did you deduce that one of my attackers was a midget?
DOCTOR: Elementary, my dear Litefoot. He came in the laundry basket and let the others in.
LEELA: The same creature that attacked me!
DOCTOR: The Peking Homunculus.
LITEFOOT: Who?
DOCTOR: Yes, the time of manufacture, its disappearance, it all fits.
LEELA: Doctor, what is the Peking
DOCTOR: Homunculus.
LEELA: Homunculus.
DOCTOR: It was made in Peking for the Commissioner of the Icelandic Alliance. It was in the Ice Age, about the year five thousand.
LITEFOOT: Preposterous.
LEELA: Shush. Go on, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The Peking Homunculus was a toy, a plaything for the Commissioner's children. It contained a series of magnetic fields operating on a printed circuit and a small computer. It had one organic component. The cerebral cortex of a pig. Anyway, something went wrong. It almost caused World War Six.
LITEFOOT: What?
DOCTOR: Yes, somehow the pig part took over. So Weng-Chiang has brought the Peking Homunculus back through time. He could have done. It disappeared completely. It was never found.
LITEFOOT: I say, I may have had a bang on the head but this is a dashed queer story. Time travel?
DOCTOR: Unsuccessful time travel, Professor. Findicker's discovery of the double nexus particle sent human science up a technological cul-de-sac.
LITEFOOT: Are you following this?
LEELA: Not a word.
DOCTOR: This pig thing is still alive. It needs an operator, of course, but the mental feedback is so intense that somehow the swinish instinct has become dominant. It hates humanity and it revels in carnage.
WENG: Liberation, Mister Sin! Freedom! I can become whole again. Whole and alive! Oh, how I have dreamt of this moment. To be free of this putrefying carcass, to fashion myself anew in some distant time and place. And I can do it now, now that at last I have the time cabinet. I promise you, Mister Sin, we shall not remain long among these filthy barbarians. But where is the bag? Answer me, you fools! Where is the bag?
HO: It was. We did not.
WENG: The bag, you cowering oaf!
HO: It was left behind, great lord.
WENG: What? What! Lee! Lee, I told you to take it out to the carriage! I ordered you! You know the penalty for failing me.
WENG: Take the sting of the scorpion.
DOCTOR: Rundall Buildings.
LITEFOOT: What?
DOCTOR: Your laundry. Do you know the place?
LITEFOOT: I've heard of it. Everyone has. It's the centre of one of the most noxious and evil rookeries in the East End.
DOCTOR: And where exactly is this disreputable quarter?
LITEFOOT: It lies somewhere between Whitechapel and St Georges in the East. Place of appalling vice and squalor. Overdue for clearance in my opinion.
DOCTOR: Yes, it might be cleared very quickly.
LITEFOOT: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Weng-Chiang is a scientific ignoramus. He doesn't understand the nature of zigma energy.
LITEFOOT: Zigma energy?
DOCTOR: Yes. The power source of the time cabinet is a zigma beam. At the moment it's like a piece of elastic fully stretched, but when Chiang tampers with it
LEELA: Then he must be stopped. Do you think he's gone to this laundry?
DOCTOR: Well, there's only one way to find out. Litefoot, I want you to stay here. Come on.
LITEFOOT: Doctor, you can't take a young woman into that foulness. At this hour of night she'll witness the vilest scenes of depravity and degradation.
DOCTOR: Nothing as vile as Weng-Chiang himself, Professor.
JAGO: Think large, Henry Jago, think large. Shilling a head? I must be crazy. A guinea a head! Conducted tours round the lair of the phantom. I'll lead them myself and modestly mention the part I played in the affair. The ladies will swoon in my arms. Oh, it's a winner. It's a beauty. I'll go bail. I'll clear out all this old junk, call in the electric lighting company.
JAGO: What in the name of heavens is?
DOCTOR: Not a sound. Now quiet. Shush.
JAGO: Thank you. Kindly tell your employer that Mister Jago wishes to see him urgently.
LITEFOOT: What?
JAGO: Your employer, Professor Litefoot. Come along, man. Hurry. Chop-chop.
LITEFOOT: May I ask, sir, who you are?
JAGO: Confound your insolence, sir. Just announce me.
LITEFOOT: Consider yourself announced, sir. I'm Litefoot.
JAGO: Why, dash me optics. I should have realised. That brow, those hands. England's peerless premier professor of pathology. Henry Gordon Jago, sir, at your service.
LITEFOOT: Mister Jago, just tell me what all this is about.
JAGO: The Doctor.
LITEFOOT: What?
JAGO: This bag.
LITEFOOT: Eh?
JAGO: Shall we go inside?
JAGO: Found this in my cellar. Thought the Doctor might be interested. It could have something to do with those Chineses.
LITEFOOT: Chinese?
JAGO: Yes. I had thought of communicating directly with Scotland Yard, where as you know he's held in the highest esteem.
LITEFOOT: The Doctor is?
JAGO: Oh yes, of course. It's my opinion he solves half their cases and then lets them take the credit for it, don't you agree?
LITEFOOT: I have no idea.
JAGO: Oh, why, it stands to reason. I mean, they're policemen. We all know they're solid, sterling, fellows, but their buttons are the brightest thing about them, don't you agree? Now, the Doctor's a real detective.
LITEFOOT: Yes, he's certainly very active. How did you learn of my connection with him, Mister Jago?
JAGO: Well, I enquired at the local station and they told me you'd been seen together. The most formidable combination in the annals of criminology. It's a great honour and privilege for me to be working with you on this devilish affair.
LITEFOOT: Oh, well, thank you. Yes, well, I'm sure the Doctor will be very interested in these things. Unfortunately, he isn't here at present.
JAGO: I know, the sleuth that never rests, eh?
LITEFOOT: Well, he did remark that sleep is for tortoises. You know, Mister Jago, I can't for the life of me discern what purposes these articles might serve.
JAGO: It's a queer lot of paraphernalia. I thought so meself.
LITEFOOT: And you think they were set aside by Weng-Chiang, this murderous lunatic the Doctor is now hunting?
JAGO: Well, they're nothing to do with the theatre, I'm sure of that. I found the bag amongst a pile of our old junk.
LITEFOOT: In that case, Mister Jago, is it not possible that someone plans to return for it?
JAGO: Yes, yes, good point. We must tell the Doctor.
LITEFOOT: Or take a hand ourselves.
JAGO: Why?
LITEFOOT: Well, the Doctor isn't here. If you and I keep a discreet watch on the theatre, we might get a chance to nab this fellow, should he return.
JAGO: You're suggesting a pernoctation, Professor, but alas, unfortunately the nocturnal vapours are very bad for my chest.
LITEFOOT: Oh, come on, man, you can wrap up. I'll lend you some extra clothing.
JAGO: Very kind, I'm sure.
LITEFOOT: Now, you write a note to the Doctor, you'll find pen and paper in that drawer, and I'll look you out a cape. We might be lucky, Mister Jago. And if we are, I've a few lumps to repay.
LEELA: That smell. It's like decaying fruit.
DOCTOR: Papaver somniferum.
LEELA: What?
DOCTOR: Pipe of poppy. It's opium, a narcotic drug.
DOCTOR: Ah, we've found another warren. Weng-Chiang will show his hand again.
LEELA: More girls?
DOCTOR: Yes. He'll try to build his body levels before he has to use the zigma beam. He'll kill again tonight, but where?
CHANG: At the House of the Dragon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good evening, Mister Chang. We thought you'd gone to join your ancestors.
CHANG: Not yet. Not quite.
LEELA: Your leg!
CHANG: A singular sight, I fear. It is too late, Doctor, and I feel no pain. The opium.
LEELA: How did you get away?
CHANG: When the rat took my leg, I regained consciousness in a charnel house, putrefying human remains.
DOCTOR: Yes, rats don't keep a very hygienic larder.
CHANG: I lay there, Doctor, and cursed Weng-Chiang, my benefactor, who had brought me to this fate. Hatred of him gave me the strength to drag myself away. The rats had gone. I came here to destroy the false god. The last act of the Great Chang.
LEELA: You should have done that before.
CHANG: I believed in him. For many years I believed in him.
DOCTOR: It was a good act, Chang.
CHANG: Until he shamed me. I lost face. The whole theatre saw my failure.
DOCTOR: Tell me about the House of the Dragon.
CHANG: Next month, the Great Chang would have performed before the Queen Empress at Buckingham Palace. I, the son of a peasant.
DOCTOR: The House of the Dragon, where is it?
CHANG: It is his fortress, prepared over many months by the Tong. Beware the eye of the dragon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Li H'sen, come on. Come on.
CHANG: Soon I shall join my ancestors. Already I can see them. They walk to greet me from the Palace of Jade. They are smiling and carry gifts of food and flowers. Now I cross the golden bridge of the gods.
DOCTOR: Li H'sen! Come on, man, the house.
CHANG: B, B
DOCTOR: What? What?
DOCTOR: Boot? Shoe? Spat?
LEELA: Earth?
DOCTOR: He's left us a Chinese puzzle.
WENG: Well? Where is it?
HO: Bag not there, lord. It's gone.
WENG: Gone?
HO: We look all places. Bag not there.
WENG: You incompetent lice! You crawling, mindless dogs! That bag contained the key to the time cabinet. I must have it, do you understand, if I have to tear this accursed city apart stone by stone! Ho! Were you followed?
HO: Followed? What?
WENG: Those two. They must have been watching the theatre. That means they have the bag! Bring them to me.
LITEFOOT: This is their hideaway, no doubt about it.
JAGO: It's unfortunate there were too many of them for us to tackle, eh, Professor? I was itching for a scrap.
LITEFOOT: The question is, Mister Jago, what now?
JAGO: Well, we could adjourn for liquid refreshment. Decorate the mahogany. I know a little spot not far from here.
LITEFOOT: I think one of us should stay here on watch while the other returns for the Doctor.
JAGO: Good idea. I'll be as quick as I can.
LITEFOOT: Too late, old man.
JAGO: Oh, corks.
LITEFOOT: Backs to the wall.
JAGO: Keep off, you lot. I'm a tiger when my dander's up.
WENG: So, you choose to pry on the House of the Dragon. Unwise. Very unwise. You will suffer for it.
LITEFOOT: You're mistaken. You'll be the sufferer when the police get here.
WENG: The police? Did you hear that, Mister Sin? They take me for a simpleton.
JAGO: Oh, they'll be here, don't you worry. They can't be far behind.
WENG: You told them where you were coming?
LITEFOOT: Of course. We're not completely without sense.
WENG: Lies. Stupid lies!
WENG: You didn't know where you were coming. You followed my men here from the theatre.
LITEFOOT: If that's what you choose to believe.
WENG: Why were you waiting at the theatre? Answer me. Why?
JAGO: Why were we waiting at the theatre, Litefoot?
LITEFOOT: I refuse to answer.
JAGO: There you are, you see. He refuses to answer.
LITEFOOT: You can do with us as you wish.
JAGO: I say, steady on.
WENG: Very well, I will tell you why.
JAGO: I say, have a care.
WENG: You were waiting to see
JAGO: You don't know your own strength.
WENG: Who came to collect the bag.
JAGO: You're choking me.
WENG: Exactly. Now, where is the bag now. What have you done with it?
LITEFOOT: Let him go.
WENG: The bag. Tell me!
LITEFOOT: It's at my house. Now for pity's sake, release him!
WENG: You will die later, slowly. It will give pleasure to my wolves.
LITEFOOT: You filthy bounder.
WENG: In the meantime, put them with the other prisoners.
DOCTOR: Litefoot? Litefoot!
DOCTOR:  My dear Doctor, contained in this capacious carpet bag, which I discovered inadvertently in the cellar, is a collection of sundry items of baffling meaning. The Professor and I are keeping observation on the theatre and shortly hope to report to you the whereabouts of the mysterious Weng-Chiang. Your fellow detective H G J.
LEELA: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Ah! Eureka! Do you know what that is?
LEELA: You ask me so that you can tell me.
DOCTOR: That's right. It's a trionic lattice, an integral part of a time cabinet. It's impossible to open it without it.
LEELA: You mean it's a key.
DOCTOR: Yes. He's not only a scientific fool, he's an absent-minded one.
LEELA: Perhaps he has another eureka.
DOCTOR: No, eureka's Greek for this bath is too hot. There can never be another one of this combination.
LEELA: That means he's gone to the theatre. Come on.
DOCTOR: Hold it.
LEELA: But Doctor, Professor Litefoot and Mister Jago are our friends! We must help them. You know what will happen if Weng-Chiang finds them.
DOCTOR: I do.
LEELA: Well?
DOCTOR: Look. Litefoot likes a good fire. He's been out of the house a long time. We can't go just rushing all over London looking for him. It's much better to wait for Weng-Chiang to come here.
LEELA: Look, we know he already has the cabinet.
DOCTOR: Yes, but he doesn't have the key. Always stay one step ahead of your enemies, my girl.
LEELA: You mean, when he finds the key is missing, and that Professor Litefoot and Mister Jago are keeping watch, he will force them to tell him where it is.
DOCTOR: You're learning to think. That's excellent.
LEELA: And you thought of that all at once, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, almost.
LEELA: Then I am sorry.
DOCTOR: What for?
LEELA: For thinking that perhaps you were afraid.
DOCTOR: That's all right.
LEELA: Where shall we lay our ambush?
DOCTOR: What?
LEELA: Ambush! It's time we did battle with this underground crab, Doctor.
JAGO: Are they dead?
LITEFOOT: Drugged, I think. You know why they're here.
JAGO: Poor creatures. They can't be a day over sixteen.
LITEFOOT: He must send his fiends to kidnap them off the streets.
JAGO: This is a nightmare. What can we do for them?
LITEFOOT: No more than we can do for ourselves. At least they'll die quickly.
JAGO: He must be the devil incarnate.
LITEFOOT: What unspeakable horror lies behind that mask, do you suppose?
JAGO: Well, he's not exactly a dobbin masher with it, is he?
LITEFOOT: Dammit, Jago, I don't see any way out of this. I think we're done for.
JAGO: You're forgetting the Doctor, Professor.
LITEFOOT: There's no hope of him finding this place. How can he?
JAGO: Oh, the trained mind. A fleck of mud here, a speck of paint there. Clues that speak volumes to a trained investigator like him. I'll wager he's on our tracks this very minute.
LITEFOOT: I say, Jago, look at this.
JAGO: What of it?
LITEFOOT: Don't you see what it is? It's a dumb waiter!
JAGO: Yes, of course I know that, but frankly I'm not very peckish at the moment. I'm surprised you should think of food at a time like this.
LITEFOOT: My dear man, I'm not thinking of food. I'm thinking that if we take that shelf out and squeeze ourselves in, we can make a surreptitious exit from this establishment via the dining room.
JAGO: By jiminy, you're right! We'll teach those blighters a lesson yet. They picked the wrong man when they decided to cross swords with me.
LITEFOOT: After you, Mister Jago.
JAGO: Oh, those ropes don't look too sound, do they.
LITEFOOT: He that is down need fear no fall.
JAGO: Hmm?
LITEFOOT: A quotation. Bunyan.
JAGO: Ah, very comforting.
JAGO : Mind your elbow, Professor.
LITEFOOT : Sorry.
BOTH : Heave!
JAGO: This isn't the dining room.
LITEFOOT: This isn't the way out, either.
LEELA: We must trap them in the crossfire, Doctor. Somewhere in the cover where they cannot find cover.
DOCTOR: What sort of crossfire? Hazelnuts? Bread pellets?
LEELA: In a house this size there must be protection. The professor will have weapons in fixed positions to guard the approaches.
DOCTOR: I brought you to the wrong time, my girl. You'd have loved Agincourt.
Part Six
DOCTOR: There's a Boot Court near the river, less than a mile from here, look.
DOCTOR: Oh, you let yourself in. That's good. We were expecting you.
WENG: No, Doctor, it was we who were expecting you.
DOCTOR: Life's full of little surprises. What have you done to her?
WENG: Nothing, yet.
DOCTOR: Take my advice. Don't.
WENG: Your advice? Oh, Doctor, you are an unusual man, but in opposing me you have gone far out of your depth. You have taken something from me. I want it back.
DOCTOR: Now I wonder what that could be? I'm always borrowing things from people and then forgetting where I've put them.
DOCTOR: It's a terrible habit.
WENG: I have never appreciated frivolity. It was in that bag. It is not there now. Give it to me!
DOCTOR: What, one of these?
WENG: The time key, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Oh, the time key. Now heavens to Betsy, where did I last see that?
WENG: I'll give you three seconds, Doctor, and then Mister Sin will kill the girl. One, two, three, kill her!
WENG: Stop!
DOCTOR: Is this what you want? The trionic lattice?
WENG: Give it to me!
DOCTOR: Careful, careful. I might have dropped it.
WENG: I'll kill you!
DOCTOR: Crystalline. Probably break into a thousand pieces.
WENG: You arrogant jackanapes!
DOCTOR: When I'm crowded I get nervous. Call your dogs off.
WENG: Back, back.
DOCTOR: That's better.
WENG: Give me that key and I will spare her life.
DOCTOR: Never trust a man with dirty fingernails.
WENG: You can trust me to kill her if you do not immediately put it down! Now obey me at once!
DOCTOR: I tell you what, I'll make a bargain with you. You can have the trionic lattice when we get to the House of the Dragon.
WENG: What trickery is this?
DOCTOR: No trickery. You're holding two others of my friends.
WENG: What of them?
DOCTOR: I want them released.
WENG: Two blundering dolts? Why?
DOCTOR: I doubt if you could understand that, but that's the condition.
WENG: Very well. They're nothing to me.
DOCTOR: Good. Right. Then you and your chaps can lead the way and I'll follow.
WENG: Bring the girl.
DOCTOR: No! The girl stays.
WENG: You would be wise not to press me too far.
DOCTOR: Just lead on.
WENG: Come!
JAGO: What's the matter?
LITEFOOT: I heard something.
JAGO: What sort of thing?
LITEFOOT: People. Quite a group just went by.
JAGO: More Wongs for the Tong, I suppose. Do you realise we've been here over an hour?
LITEFOOT: It'll be dawn soon.
JAGO: What does that signify?
LITEFOOT: I'm not aware that it signifies anything. It's just a remark.
JAGO: I thought perhaps they might do things at dawn.
LITEFOOT: Do things? What sort of things?
JAGO: Well, you know, sacrifice their victims.
LITEFOOT: You're thinking of the Druids, aren't you? I'm not aware the Chinese make a ceremony of it.
JAGO: Oh, good. I don't think I could stomach that. It's been worrying me somewhat.
LITEFOOT: Best not to think about it.
JAGO: I can't help it. Beastly heathens. That's my trouble, Litefoot.
LITEFOOT: What?
JAGO: Well, I'm not awfully. Well, I'm not so bally brave when it comes to it. I try to be but I'm not.
LITEFOOT: When it comes to it, I don't suppose anybody is.
JAGO: Well, I thought I ought to tell you anyway, in case I let the side down.
LITEFOOT: You won't, Henry. I know you won't.
WENG: Fetch the prisoners here.
DOCTOR: Very impressive. I'll have the Bird's Nest Soup.
WENG: What?
DOCTOR: Well, isn't this where you do the cooking?
WENG: How can you understand the functions of a catalytic extraction chamber, Doctor? Part of a technology far beyond your time.
DOCTOR: Simple old-fashioned cannibalism. That machine just saves you having to chew the grisly bits.
WENG: Much more than that. The secret of life.
DOCTOR: Bunkum. Your so-called technology is the twisted lunacy of a scientific dark age.
WENG: What do you know of my time?
DOCTOR: Everything. Where is it?
WENG: What?
DOCTOR: Your pig-faced, pig-brained Peking Homunculus.
WENG : You know of that? How?
DOCTOR: I was with the Filipino army at the final advance on Reykjavik.
WENG: How can you in the nineteenth century know anything of the fifty first? You lie!
DOCTOR: Listen. What's your name? What were you called before you became a Chinese god?
WENG: I am Magnus Greel!
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, the infamous Minister of Justice. The Butcher of Brisbane.
DOCTOR: Checkmate.
WENG: It is impossible for you to know these things!
DOCTOR: I know you're a wanted criminal and that a hundred thousand deaths can be laid at your door.
WENG: Enemies of the state! They were used in the advancements of science.
DOCTOR: They were slaughtered in your filthy machine.
WENG: So, you are from the future, and I, for all my achievements, are only remembered as a war criminal. Of course, it is the winning side that writes history, Doctor. Remember, you would not be here if it were not for my work.
DOCTOR: Your work?
DOCTOR: Your work?
WENG: Yes! I made this possible. I found the resources, the scientists
DOCTOR: The zigma experiments came to nothing. They were a failure. Nothing came of them.
WENG: No! No, they were a success! Why, I used them to escape from my enemies. The first man to travel through time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Look what it did to you.
WENG: A temporal distortion of my metabolism. It can be readjusted.
LITEFOOT: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Good morning, gentlemen.
JAGO: By jingo, what did I tell you? The game's up, my friend. We have the place surrounded.
DOCTOR: No, Jago, Jago, Jago. We don't have the place surrounded. We just have an understanding.
JAGO: Understanding?
DOCTOR: Yes.
WENG: I have kept my word, Doctor. Now give me the key.
DOCTOR: Only when they're well clear of this place. Off you go now. Hurry.
LITEFOOT: Doctor, there are two others here. Two wretched girls.
DOCTOR: Then take them with you.
WENG: Your demands are becoming too great!
WENG: Enough! I want him alive.
DOCTOR: Beware the Eye of the Dragon.
LITEFOOT: Doctor, are you hurt?
WENG: Take them out. Get these stinking heaps of rubbish out of here!
WENG: Perfect. Perfect. After all these years the function is unimpaired.
WENG: Everything exactly as it was. The parallax synchrons fully charged, the strata tube set at maximum. He was wrong! Wrong! The zigma experiment was a success!
LITEFOOT: Curious. Double heartbeat. Otherwise everything seems in order.
JAGO: If only we knew what that fiendish device was that struck him down. From behind, mark you.
LITEFOOT: Shush. I think he's trying to say something.
DOCTOR: There's a one-eyed yellow idol to the north of Katmandu. There's a little marble cross below the town.
LITEFOOT: Kipling?
DOCTOR: Harry Champion, 1920.
LITEFOOT: Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Greel's got the key!
LITEFOOT: Greel?
DOCTOR: How long have I been unconscious?
LITEFOOT: Only a few minutes.
DOCTOR: The broth of oblivion.
JAGO: What's that?
DOCTOR: Chinese soup. He'll be coming for them soon.
LITEFOOT: Well, surely there must be something we can do for them?
DOCTOR: There's always something we can do. Get them over there against the wall. Come on.
JAGO: They're armed to the teeth, those Wong fellows. Knives, guns, everything.
LITEFOOT: Jago's right. Empty handed we can do nothing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. This is good strong linen. It should do fine. Well, don't just stand there wasting time. Get me a bucket of water and break off that gas pipe.
WENG: Almost ready. Yes, time to prepare my two partridges. Why don't you come down from there? Sulking because I wouldn't let you kill the Doctor, is that it?
WENG: Oh, you can kill him soon enough, Sin, but first I must drain every scintilla of his knowledge about the zigma experiment. You can kill him then, and as many more as you wish before we leave. All I need is to re-establish my protenoid balance.
WENG: Then I can enter the zigma beam for the second time. Only this time, there must be no mistake in the programme DNA levels. Now for my two partridges.
LEELA: Die, bent face!
WENG: No, spare me, please!
LEELA: Spawn of evil. Now I destroy you!
WENG: The second time! The second attempt on my life by this she-devil! Hold her still! No. No, I have a better fate for you. She will be the first morsel to feed my regeneration.
LEELA: Kill me any way you wish. Unlike you, I am not afraid to die.
WENG: We shall see. Bring the tigress here.
WENG: At my camps, the extraction process was considered the most painful of all. They pleaded for anything but this.
LEELA: I shall not plead, but I promise you this. When we are both in the great hereafter, I shall hunt you down, Bent Face, and put you through my agony a thousand times!
WENG: Silence the spitfire!
WENG: Now bring the other two hags here.
JAGO: It's leaking. I can smell it.
LITEFOOT: There's bound to be some escape.
DOCTOR: Not enough to worry about.
JAGO: I'm not worried, Doctor. I haven't been worried since you turned up. It's just that I'd hate to be gassed before seeing if this stunt works.
DOCTOR: Well, Greel won't keep us waiting long. He needs his proteinoids.
LITEFOOT: His what?
DOCTOR: He's dying, you see. He's desperate. His body's fading away fast. He's trying to cheat death by substituting certain materials. Do you understand?
LITEFOOT: I think so. The principle, anyway.
DOCTOR: The principle's false, anyhow. All he achieves is a postponement of the inevitable.
JAGO: Shush.
DOCTOR: Lucifers, Professor. Quick, get over there. Now listen, if we do manage to get out of here, don't stop running till you're a mile from this place.
JAGO: Up troops and at 'em, eh, Professor?
DOCTOR: Come on, come on.
DOCTOR: This way.
WENG: Whatever it was, there can be no escape for you. Let the talons of Weng-Chiang shred your flesh!
DOCTOR: Greel!
WENG: Kill, Sin! Kill them!
DOCTOR: Come on, quick. Get down! Get down!
LEELA: I owe you my life, Doctor. Thank you.
JAGO: Time to thank him when we're out of this.
WENG: Doctor, I offer you a proposition.
DOCTOR: Not now, Greel, we're busy.
WENG: I will spare your lives, you and your friends, if you leave now.
DOCTOR: Well, that's very magnanimous of you, Magnus.
WENG: Then get up and leave.
DOCTOR: What, with your trigger-happy little friend out there? No thanks.
WENG: I am offering you your lives, you fools!
DOCTOR:  We'd be cut down before we reached the door.
LEELA:  I think so, too. He has no truth in him.
DOCTOR:  Let's see.
DOCTOR: Ah. We're staying put, Magnus.
WENG: Then you'll die here, all of you.
DOCTOR: Well, you might die first, Magnus. You don't sound too well, and your food supply's half way to Blackheath by now.
WENG: Sin, crack that bench away.
LITEFOOT: If I only had a gun, Doctor.
JAGO: Or a catapult. I was a dab hand with a catapult when I was a nipper.
LITEFOOT: What is that weapon?
DOCTOR: It's a laser beam.
JAGO: It's a death ray.
LEELA:  Doctor, they're diminishing our cover.
DOCTOR:  Push it over.
WENG: Hurry, Sin! There is little time left to me.
WENG: No, Sin! You fool, stop! Stop! Obey me, Sin. Obey Greel, your master, I command you.
JAGO: Jiminy, I felt the heat of that one.
JAGO: No chance, my dear.
LEELA: He cannot fire at two objects at once.
JAGO: You mean one of us creates a distraction while you go for the gun?
LEELA: That's right. Me because I'm quicker.
LITEFOOT: Another minute or so and we're done.
JAGO: I say, I say, I say!
JAGO: A funny thing happened to me. Has she got the gun?
LITEFOOT: Hey! Who are you shooting at?
LEELA: Well, I've never fired one of these before.
LITEFOOT: Got them rattled, anyway.
DOCTOR: It's no good, Greel. You're finished.
WENG: I can escape you, Doctor, as I escaped my enemies before.
DOCTOR: Greel, listen. If you activate the zigma beam, it'll be certain death for all of us.
WENG: Lies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Listen, Greel! Greel, listen! The zigma beam is at full stretch. If you trigger it again, it'll mean certain collapse. You know what that means?
WENG: You can't fool me.
DOCTOR: There'll be a huge implosion, Greel, and you'll be at the centre of it. The zigma experiments were a disaster!
WENG: No, no, the zigma experiment was a success! A brilliant, total success!
WENG: Sin, Sin, what are you doing?
WENG: I order you to. No, no, not me. This is mutiny, Sin.
LEELA: Is Bent Face dead?
LITEFOOT: Why do you call him Bent Face?
LEELA: Because it is. No, don't.
LITEFOOT: Why not?
DOCTOR: Cellular collapse.
LITEFOOT: In all my years as a pathologist, I've never seen anything like it.
DOCTOR: Well, let's hope you never see anything like it again, Professor.
JAGO: But where was he from? Where did he go?
DOCTOR: He was a foe from the future, Henry. Look out, Leela!
JAGO: What's that?
DOCTOR: It's his fuse, Henry.
LEELA: What are you doing, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm bringing the zigma experiment to an end.
CRIER : Muffins! Get your hot muffins!
DOCTOR: Listen.
CRIER : Hot muffins!
DOCTOR: It's the muffin man. Come on, I'll buy you some muffins.
LITEFOOT: And then, for example, I would say 'one lump or two, Miss Leela'. To which you would reply, 'one will suffice, thank you'. Now, do you follow?
LEELA: Supposing I want two?
LITEFOOT: Oh, no, no, no, no. One lump for ladies.
LEELA: Then why do you ask me?
DOCTOR: Come along, Leela.
LEELA: Professor Litefoot has been explaining to me about tea.
DOCTOR: Really?
LEELA: It's very complicated.
DOCTOR: No, it's not complicated at all. All you. Look, I haven't got time to stand here discussing tea. Goodbye, Litefoot.
LITEFOOT: Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's been such fun. Henry.
DOCTOR : Yes, the important thing is just warming the pot.
LEELA : What pot?
DOCTOR : The tea pot.
LITEFOOT: What exactly is that contraption?
JAGO: Well, it's his personal transport. Look, Police.
LITEFOOT: Extraordinary.
JAGO: No doubt Scotland Yard provided it for him.
LITEFOOT: I don't believe it!
JAGO: I've said it before and I'll say it again. Our policemen are wonderful.
LITEFOOT: But it's impossible, Henry. Quite impossible.
JAGO: Good trick, eh? I venture the great Li H'sen Chang himself would have appreciated that.
