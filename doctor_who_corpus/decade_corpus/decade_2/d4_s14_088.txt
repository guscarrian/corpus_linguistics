The Deadly Assassin
Part One
Through the millennia, the Time Lords of Gallifrey led a life of peace and ordered calm, protected from all threats from lesser civilisations by their great power.
But this was to change. Suddenly and terribly, the Time Lords faced the most dangerous crisis in their long history ...
DOCTOR: The Panopticon.
DOCTOR: No! No!
TANNOY: Sector seven, sector seven, alert. Unauthorised capsule entry imminent. Repeat, unauthorised capsule entry imminent. Stand to on sector seven.
DOCTOR: Right outside the Capitol itself. I'm in trouble now.
DOCTOR: The Chancery guards. Pft. What a welcome home.
HILDRED: It looks
SPANDRELL: Yes?
HILDRED: If I didn't know better, Castellan, I'd swear it was a Type Forty.
SPANDRELL: It is.
HILDRED: But that's impossible.
HILDRED : There are no Type Forties in service. They're out of commission, obsolete.
DOCTOR: Obsolete? Twaddle. Take no notice, my dear old thing.
SPANDRELL : Nevertheless, Commander, this is a Tardis. It's in an unauthorised zone. I want the occupants arrested.
SPANDRELL: The barrier on this model is a double curtain trimonic, so you will need a cypher indent key to get in.
HILDRED: Very good, Castellan. I'll send for one.
SPANDRELL: After you have arrested the personnel, impound the machine.
HILDRED: Of course, Castellan. Will you want me to question the
SPANDRELL: Eventually, yes, but not on a Presidential Resignation Day, Hildred.
DOCTOR: Presidential Resignation Day!
SPANDRELL: Data retrieval. Request information on all Type Forty TT capsules currently operational.
COMPUTER: Negative information. Type Forty TT capsules are deregistered and non-operational.
SPANDRELL: Report number of de-registrations.
COMPUTER: Three hundred and four.
SPANDRELL: Report number of registrations.
COMPUTER: Three hundred and five.
SPANDRELL: Report reason for numerical imbalance.
COMPUTER: One capsule removed from register. Reference, Malfeasance Tribunal order dated three zero nine nine zero six.
ENGIN: Can I be of any further help, Castellan Spandrell?
SPANDRELL: One minute, Engin.
HILDRED : Commander Hildred, Sector seven.
SPANDRELL: Malfeasance, Hildred.
HILDRED : Malfeasance?
SPANDRELL : The occupant of your Type Forty is a convicted criminal. Approach with caution.
HILDRED: Very good, Castellan. Set your stasers.
DOCTOR: I must get past them and warn the President.
DOCTOR: Cash and carry, Constantinople.
HILDRED: Right, follow me.
HILDRED: Don't move. I said, don't move.
HILDRED: There he goes! Quick!
DOCTOR: Hey, just a minute! Excuse me!
HILDRED: Coyned. He's got into the tower. You'll have to check every floor.
HILDRED: All guards report to main tower, sector seven. Dangerous intruder at large.
ENGIN: The Tribunal chose, in view of the extenuating circumstances, to impose a lenient sentence.
SPANDRELL: What?
ENGIN:  The Tribunal chose
SPANDRELL: What sentence?
ENGIN: Oh, I beg your pardon. Banishment to Earth.
SPANDRELL: Earth?
ENGIN: Sol Three, in Mutter's Spiral. Rather an interesting little planet, I understand. Several of our
SPANDRELL: Is there anything further of relevance I should know, Coordinator Engin?
ENGIN: I see there is an addendum. Ah, yes. The sentence was subsequently remitted at the intercession of the CIA.
SPANDRELL: Celestial Intervention Agency. They get their fingers into everything. Is he mixed up with them?
ENGIN: There's nothing further on the file.
SPANDRELL: Oh yes, they'd see to it that there wouldn't be. Can you get me his extract biog?
ENGIN: Yes, certainly. Won't take a moment.
HILDRED: Castellan, I have to report the intruder in Sector seven
SPANDRELL: Well?
HILDRED: Evaded us. And he shot one of my guards.
SPANDRELL: I see. Such efficiency.
HILDRED: But we have him trapped in the communications tower, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: Well done, Hildred. An antiquated capsule, for which you get adequate early warning, tranducts on the very perimeter of the Capitol. You are informed that the occupant is a known criminal, whereupon you allow him to escape and conceal himself in a building a mere fifty three stories high. A clever stratagem, Hildred. You're trying to confuse him, I take it?
HILDRED: I apologise, Castellan. He won't evade capture a second time.
SPANDRELL: In the light of your impressive record so far, I would make no rash commitments.
HILDRED: I found this in the capsule.
SPANDRELL: To the Castellan of the Chancery Guard. I've good reason to think the life of His Supremacy the President is in grave danger. Do not ignore this warning. The Doctor. And he signed it over the Prydonian Seal.
ENGIN: Apparently he is or was at one time a member of that noble Chapter.
SPANDRELL: How can you tell?
ENGIN: Well, the biog data extracts of Time Lords are colour coded according to Chapter.
SPANDRELL: I didn't know that.
ENGIN: No? Well, your duties usually involve you with more plebian classes, don't they, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: A Prydonian renegade, eh? I have to refer this to Chancellor Goth.
FIGURE: Predictable as ever, Doctor.
SPANDRELL: He's a Prydonian renegade, sir, and as you know, when a Prydonian forswears his birthright, there is nothing else he fears to lose.
GOTH: So you think there is a real danger, Castellan?
SPANDRELL: He has already killed one of the guards. I think he's ruthless and determined. A typical CIA agent.
GOTH: But if he is a member of the Celestial Intervention Agency, why should he wish to harm the President?
SPANDRELL: He could have been suborned. If he's being false to his Prydonian vows, his fidelity is already suspect.
GOTH: But this note? Why warn us in advance?
SPANDRELL: Perhaps to get us nervous, or just looking the wrong way. Prydonians are notoriously
GOTH: Devious? Not true, Castellan. We simply see a little further ahead than most. Anyway, what is it you want?
SPANDRELL: Permission to withdraw fifty guards from the Panopticon to search the communications tower.
GOTH: A great loss of pomp and circumstance.
SPANDRELL: I'll feel much happier once he is in custody.
GOTH: Very well, Spandrell. I should like to see this Tardis. Extraordinary to think an old Type Forty is still operational.
SPANDRELL: It's in Sector seven, cloisters.
GOTH: Then we'll have to hurry. I have an audience with the Cardinals in a few minutes.
DOCTOR: Now, where's the local news programme? Ah.
RUNCIBLE : Around me in these high galleries of the Panopticon
RUNCIBLE : Already the Time Lords are gathering, donning seldom worn robes with their colourful collar insignia. The scarlet and orange of the Prydonians, the green of the Arcalians, the heliotrope of the Patrexes, and so on.
RUNCIBLE : And the one question that is on all their lips, the question of the day, as His Supremacy leaves public life, is who will he name as his successor?
DOCTOR: Oh no, it's Runcible. Runcible the Fatuous.
RUNCIBLE : In a moment, I hope to talk to Cardinal Borusa, the leader of the Prydonian Chapter, the Chapter that has produced more Time Lord Presidents than all other Chapters together, and perhaps get an answer to this question.
RUNCIBLE: Cardinal Borusa, if you can spare a moment, sir.
BORUSA: Yes?
RUNCIBLE: Public Register Video. If I could ask you a few questions?
BORUSA: Good gracious. Runcible, is it not?
RUNCIBLE: Yes, sir.
BORUSA: One of my old pupils at Prydon Academy.
RUNCIBLE: May I congratulate you, sir, on your elevation to Cardinal?
BORUSA: Thank you, Runcible. Good day.
RUNCIBLE: No, no, wait, sir. Please, if I could ask you a few questions.
BORUSA: Runcible, you had ample opportunity to ask me questions during your mis-spent years at the Academy. You failed to avail yourself of the opportunity then and it is too late now. Good day.
RUNCIBLE : I'm afraid Cardinal Borusa cannot, at this present moment in the time band, commit himself. However, it is certainly no secret that a very senior member of the Prydonian Chapter, and the present number two in the Time Lord Council, Chancellor Goth, is the widely fancied candidate.
DOCTOR: Oh, get off.
GOTH : There's no way this Doctor can enter the Capitol from the tower, is there?
SPANDRELL: Not unless he's got the help of an accomplice.
GOTH: From within?
SPANDRELL: Perhaps he's gone to the tower to shake of his pursuers while somebody inside lifts the barrier.
GOTH: What an inventive suspicious mind you have, Spandrell. So this in an old Type Forty.
SPANDRELL: Its shape was infinitely variable.
GOTH: Remarkably good condition. What are you going to do with it?
SPANDRELL: I hadn't thought. I was more interested in its operator.
GOTH: Well, I shouldn't leave it here in case he tries to sneak back. Transduct it back into the Capitol.
SPANDRELL: Very well, sir.
GOTH: Oh, and, er, keep me informed about your progress on the conspiracy.
SPANDRELL: Of course. Transduct this to the museum.
DOCTOR: What a way to travel. But which way the Panopticon?
FIGURE: So, he is within the Capitol.
MAN: All his actions are exactly as you predicted, Master.
FIGURE: I know him.
MAN: He is resourceful. He will gain the Panopticon without further help.
FIGURE: Of course, he knows he is entering a trap.
FIGURE: But how can he resist such a bait? MAN: The hope of preventing an assassination.
FIGURE: Quixotic fool. He will die quickly. Make certain he dies very quickly.
SPANDRELL: Well?
HILDRED: We checked the tower, Castellan. Nothing.
SPANDRELL: Nothing?
HILDRED: Fifty two floors. Nothing. He never left the lift. We think he doubled back.
SPANDRELL: To the capsule?
HILDRED: Out here. There's nowhere else for him.
SPANDRELL: Come with me, and bring the tracker.
GUARD: Castellan.
SPANDRELL: Now he could get into the Panopticon.
HILDRED: But everyone has to show a pass. The door guards will never let any
SPANDRELL: Do you think they will stop Gold Usher? Would you? Get over there and try to find him.
HILDRED: Very good, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: And Hildred, try to be discreet.
TIME LORD 1: You know, I remember the inaugural of Pandek the Third.
TIME LORD 2: Really?
TIME LORD 1: Yeah. Nine hundred years, he lasted. Now there was a President with some staying power, what?
TIME LORD 2: What?
TIME LORD 1: Staying power. Where the dickens is my gown?
TIME LORD 2: Nine hundred years, eh?
TIME LORD 1: I could have sworn it was here a second ago.
DOCTOR: Here you are, sir.
TIME LORD 1: Ah, thank you. Most kind. Yes, very different from the fellows nowadays, what? They're chopping and changing every couple of centuries.
TIME LORD 2: You're not gold, are you?
TIME LORD 1: Not what? This isn't my gown! That fellow's given me the wrong gown.
TIME LORD 2: What fellow?
SPANDRELL: There may be something in his history. Some clue. If only I could convince the Chancellor the threat is serious.
ENGIN: It would have to be very serious before they'd delay the ceremony. The President must be on his way to the Panopticon by now. Can I have the data, Castellan?
SPANDRELL: This has been in the reader recently.
ENGIN: Surely not.
SPANDRELL: No mica dust.
ENGIN: What? There are millions of extracts in the archives. It's hardly feasible
SPANDRELL: I live with the dirt of the past, Coordinator Engin, and I can tell you that the old crimes besmirch the fingers.
ENGIN: Well, if it has been withdrawn, there'll certainly be a record.
SPANDRELL: I shall want to know who had it.
ENGIN: Yes.
SPANDRELL: But let's see the extract first.
ENGIN: A pleasure, Castellan.
FIGURE: Heh, heh, heh. The innocent to the slaughter.
GOLD USHER: You have everything, sir?
PRESIDENT: I think so.
GOLD USHER: The list?
PRESIDENT: What? Oh, the resignation honours list. Yes, here it is. Some names here that will surprise them.
DOCTOR: Runcible, my dear chap. How nice to see you.
RUNCIBLE: What? Oh, I don't believe we've, er. Oh, I say. Weren't you expelled or something? Some scandal?
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all been forgotten about now, old boy.
RUNCIBLE: Oh, really? Well, where've you been all these years?
DOCTOR: Oh, here and there, you know. Round and about.
RUNCIBLE: Is there something the matter?
DOCTOR: Oh no, just a twinge in the knee.
RUNCIBLE: Well, if you will lead such a rackety life. Have you had a facelift?
DOCTOR: Several, so far.
RUNCIBLE: Yes, well, nice to have met you. I must get on. I'm doing the PR videocast.
DOCTOR: Yes, and splendidly too, if I may say so.
RUNCIBLE: Oh, do you think so?
DOCTOR: Oh, it's a gift. Somehow you have a wonderful way of making the whole thing come alive.
RUNCIBLE: Oh, that's very nice of you.
RUNCIBLE: Oh, that'll be the President now. He's just arrived at the Panopticon.
RUNCIBLE: Are you sure you're all right?
DOCTOR: What? Yes.
RUNCIBLE: Come on, you stupid yoik.
DOCTOR: What?
RUNCIBLE: I should be getting a signal from my camera technician up there.
DOCTOR: No!
DOCTOR: Let me go! Let me go!
RUNCIBLE:  Just a little disturbance here in the Panopticon, as the President starts to ascend. Already the members of the High Council, led by Chancellor Goth, are moving forward to greet His Supremacy.
Part Two
HILDRED: There he is.
TIME LORD: What a terrible thing to happen.
RUNCIBLE: Did you see what happened, sir?
TIME LORD: It's terrible, terrible.
RUNCIBLE: But is the President dead?
BORUSA: We live in evil times.
RUNCIBLE: Ah, Castellan Spandrell. Perhaps you can tell me what has happened?
SPANDRELL: Will you all stand back, please. We've got the criminal.
TIME LORD: Is that him?
BORUSA: A Prydonian.
HILDRED: He was in the gallery, sir, still holding this.
DOCTOR: Extraordinary. The roof's still on. I could have sworn it fell on me.
SPANDRELL: Get him to a detention room.
DOCTOR: No, no, wait, wait, I
GUARD: Move it.
GOTH: Castellan!
SPANDRELL: Sir.
GOTH: The President is dead. The trial will start immediately.
SPANDRELL: I need more time.
GOTH: Time for what?
SPANDRELL: There are unanswered questions.
GOTH: That, presumably, will be the purpose of the trial.
BORUSA: Such haste is against all our traditions of fairness and justice.
GOTH: This is a constitutional crisis. The President died without naming his successor. An election must be held within forty eight hours.
BORUSA: But that is a separate matter.
GOTH: No, Cardinal! The Time Lords must not be seen to be leaderless and in disarray. The assassin must be tried and executed before the election.
HILDRED: You will confess, Doctor.
DOCTOR: All right. All right, I'll confess.
HILDRED: Very sensible.
DOCTOR: I confess you're a bigger idiot than I thought you were. Argh.
HILDRED: There are fifteen intensity levels in this device, Doctor. At the moment, you're only experiencing level nine. Much easier to talk.
DOCTOR: I've got nothing to say.
HILDRED: Oh, you'll think of something, soon.
DOCTOR: Tweedledum.
SPANDRELL: Turn it off.
DOCTOR: Tweedledee.
SPANDRELL: I must apologise for my subordinate. He lets his enthusiasm run away with him.
DOCTOR: I see. The hot and cold technique.
SPANDRELL: We are simply seekers of the truth, and we haven't got much time. Chancellor Goth has ordered your immediate trial.
DOCTOR: I'd like to help you. How about a signed confession?
SPANDRELL: That will help. I hate going to court without possessing the full facts. Motive, for instance.
DOCTOR: Now that's a sensible question. Why should anyone want to assassinate a retiring President?
SPANDRELL: A personal grudge?
DOCTOR: I never met him.
SPANDRELL: I know. I have seen your biog.
DOCTOR: And you still think I did it?
SPANDRELL: I think you're going to be executed for it. They are preparing the vaporisation chamber now. You have about three hours to live, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What? Well, that's monstrous. Vaporisation without representation is against the constitution.
SPANDRELL: You are an embarrassment.
DOCTOR: You realise I've been framed, don't you.
SPANDRELL: Framed?
DOCTOR: Yes, framed. It's an Earth expression. It means that someone's gone to a great deal of trouble to get me into this mess.
SPANDRELL: Why did you come back here?
DOCTOR: To try and save the President's life. If you remember, I left a note for you.
SPANDRELL: Yes.
DOCTOR: Which, presumably, you did nothing about.
SPANDRELL: All that I could. So you knew the President was going to be assassinated?
DOCTOR: Yes. In a way, I experienced it.
SPANDRELL: Go on.
DOCTOR : Well, this is the bit you won't believe. People talk of a premonition of tragedy, but I actually saw it happening. I saw the President die as vividly, as clearly as I can see this room now.
SPANDRELL : And where were you when this happened?
DOCTOR : In the Tardis, travelling in vortex, after I'd heard the Panopticon summons.
SPANDRELL: What do you think?
ENGIN: Precognitive vision is impossible.
SPANDRELL: He knows that, and he knows that we know it, and yet he maintains it happened.
ENGIN: And that's why you believe him?
SPANDRELL: I'm beginning to.
ENGIN: Nobody else will.
SPANDRELL: I think he's being framed.
ENGIN: Framed?
SPANDRELL: An Earth expression.
ENGIN: Oh.
SPANDRELL: You were going to check for me who had withdrawn the Doctor's DE.
ENGIN: Nobody. I'm afraid you were wrong about that, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: I don't think so.
ENGIN: The machine is infallible. Data extraction is impossible without an operating key like this.
ENGIN: And the code of the particular key is recorded here, opposite the archive number of the data extract.
ENGIN: Now, as you can see, my key is the only one entered against the Doctor's DE.
SPANDRELL: And how many of those keys are there?
ENGIN: They're only issued to High Councillors. Nobody else is allowed to inspect the DE's of Time Lords, except for yourself, Castellan, in the line of duty.
SPANDRELL: The record could have been erased, I take it.
ENGIN: You obviously have no idea of the complexity of excitonic circuitry.
SPANDRELL: No, I haven't, but if somebody knew what he was doing?
ENGIN: It would require a mathematical genius with a phenomenal grasp of applied excitonics.
SPANDRELL: Really? There can't be many of those on the High Council.
BORUSA: We should allow time for reflection, for passions to cool.
GOTH: A wise and beloved President brutally shot down in his last hour of office? No matter how much time we allow, that fact won't alter.
BORUSA: A violent action is causing an equally violent reaction.
GOTH: Oh, I understand that, Cardinal, but there is another consideration. Quite possibly, after the election, I shall have the honour of being President of the Council.
BORUSA: You're being over-modest, Chancellor. I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure that the President would have named you as his successor.
GOTH: Who knows what was in the President's mind? But it is the custom, as you know, for an incoming president to pardon political prisoners. Is he to set free the murderer of his predecessor, or break with custom? Either course would be difficult. I intend to avoid the dilemma by seeing this affair through before he takes office.
BORUSA: Chancellor, all presidents are faced with difficult decisions. It is by their decisions that they are judged.
HILDRED: The prisoner eluded us at that time. Later I went with Castellan Spandrell to the Capitol Museum where the TT capsule had been transferred. Erogen tracer immediately became active. I concluded the prisoner must have been in the vicinity sometime previous.
RUNCIBLE: He seemed nervous, well, apprehensive. He was looking around all the time that we were talking. Then, just before the President appeared, he turned and started to run across the Panopticon. After that, I thought he said
TIME LORD: He pushed past me in a loutish and unmannerly way. Never in all my years of attendance at the Panopticon can I recall such
GOTH: If you could confine yourself to this incident, sir. What happened next?
TIME LORD: Well, I caught him by the arm to remonstrate with him, and he shouted 'Let me go. They'll kill him.'
GOTH: Are you quite sure of that?
TIME LORD: What?
GOTH: Are you perhaps getting a little hard of hearing these days?
TIME LORD: Well, er, at my age one can expect these things. I've been having a bit of trouble with my hip lately.
GOTH: Let me put it to you. Could the accused have said, 'Let me go, I will kill him'?
TIME LORD: Well, yes, I suppose it is possible. He could have said that.
GOTH: Thank you. Has the accused anything to say before sentence is pronounced?
DOCTOR: Yes. Article Seventeen.
GOTH: Article Seventeen?
DOCTOR: I offer myself as a candidate for the Presidency.
GOTH: The application is frivolous.
DOCTOR: No, sir. I invoke Article Seventeen of the Constitution which is a guarantee of liberty and says, in part, that no candidate for office shall in anyway be debarred or restrained from presenting his claim.
GOTH: The guarantee of liberty does not extend to murderers.
BORUSA: As a jurist, Chancellor, I must point out that until the accused is pronounced guilty, he is protected by Article Seventeen.
GOTH: He is abusing a legal technicality.
DOCTOR: No, sir, I am claiming a legal right.
BORUSA: Chancellor, this court must be adjourned until the election is over.
GOTH: Very well. But do not think you will escape justice. Castellan Spandrell?
SPANDRELL: Sir.
GOTH: See that the accused gets no opportunity to leave the Capitol.
SPANDRELL: Yes, sir.
SPANDRELL: Forty eight hours, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, it's better than three.
SPANDRELL: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Suppose, suppose I can convince you I didn't do it?
SPANDRELL: All right, convince me.
FIGURE: Well?
MAN: The trial was adjourned, master. He pleaded Article Seventeen.
FIGURE: He remains as ingenious as ever.
MAN: He will not escape.
FIGURE: Escape? Escape is not in his mind. Now he is hunting you.
MAN: It was a mistake to bring him here. We could have used anyone.
FIGURE: No, we could not have used anyone. You do not understand hatred as I understand it. Only hate keeps me alive. Why else should I endure this pain? I must see the Doctor die in shame and dishonour. Yes, and I must destroy the Time Lords. Nothing else matters. Nothing!
SPANDRELL: Don't get any ambitious ideas.
DOCTOR: I just wanted to check it was the same staser. You see that symbol at the end of the corridor?
SPANDRELL: What about it?
DOCTOR: You try and hit it.
SPANDRELL What?
DOCTOR: Go on. You try and hit it.
SPANDRELL: Just the kind of hooliganism we're always running the Shabogans in for.
SPANDRELL: Miles away.
DOCTOR: The sights. So you see, I couldn't have shot the President if I tried. And equally, I couldn't hit the assassin. That's why they were fixed.
SPANDRELL: The assassin, according to you, being one of the High Council.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, he was in the party surrounding the President. I saw him draw a staser and step forward. I aimed a bolt at him, but at that time I didn't know the sights had been fixed.
SPANDRELL: One of the High Council. It's getting better and better.
DOCTOR: What is?
SPANDRELL: Your story. But still a story. Where's the evidence, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'll tell you where the evidence is.
SPANDRELL: Where?
DOCTOR: In the Public Register camera. I was standing right beside it.
SPANDRELL: Doctor, you may yet end up as President. Hildred?
HILDRED: Yes, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: Take the Doctor to the Panopticon.
HILDRED: Now, sir?
SPANDRELL: Of course now. And I want Commentator Runcible there too. And wait for me.
HILDRED: Very good, Castellan.
GOTH: That's an unusual request. You want the Panopticon open at this hour?
SPANDRELL: For further investigation, sir.
GOTH: I see. Well, if there is anything further to be discovered, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: Thank you, sir.
GOTH: You're keeping a close watch on the Doctor, I hope?
SPANDRELL: Someone is with him all the time.
GOTH: Good. You know that, apart from myself, he is the only other candidate in this election?
SPANDRELL: Is that so.
GOTH: A murderer and a renegade. That exposes the highest office in the land to ridicule. Well, my first action as President will be to have Cardinal Borusa draft an amendment to Article Seventeen. I shall see that this sort of thing never happens again.
RUNCIBLE: It's not really my field, of course. The technician would normally be responsible.
SPANDRELL: Your technician disappeared. Probably scared to death of being involved. All I want to see is the last sequence leading up to the assassination.
RUNCIBLE: I expect that will be in the last band of the drum.
SPANDRELL: Splendid. So perhaps you'll be good enough to fetch it.
RUNCIBLE: Yes, all right, Castellan.
DOCTOR: About there.
SPANDRELL: Then the bullet would have passed over and to the left.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SPANDRELL: Let's see.
HILDRED: Castellan.
SPANDRELL: What is it?
HILDRED: I thought I saw a movement up there.
SPANDRELL: Oh, that's Runcible. Might be something across here.
HILDRED : Here, Castellan.
DOCTOR: Is that it?
SPANDRELL: Stasers don't do a lot of damage, except to body tissue. Looking at the President, you couldn't say whether he was hit in the head or the leg.
HILDRED: That was Runcible!
SPANDRELL : Runcible, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Well, at least he's alive.
SPANDRELL: Come on, what happened?
RUNCIBLE: Horrible. Horrible.
SPANDRELL: What are you talking about?
RUNCIBLE: My technician.
SPANDRELL: Where?
RUNCIBLE: In the camera.
SPANDRELL: Good grief. What's happened to him?
DOCTOR: Matter condensation. A particularly nasty sort of death.
HILDRED: No wonder we couldn't find him.
SPANDRELL: I've never seen anything like it.
DOCTOR: I have, I'm afraid.
SPANDRELL: You have?
DOCTOR: Yes. It's a technique the Master picked up somewhere on his travels.
SPANDRELL: Who's the Master?
DOCTOR: Who is the Master? He's my sworn arch-enemy. A fiend who glories in chaos and destruction.
SPANDRELL: A Time Lord?
DOCTOR: Yes, a long time ago. You know, a lot of things are becoming clearer.
SPANDRELL: Not to me.
DOCTOR: If the Master is here on Gallifrey, then this represents the final challenge. It explains why I was brought here. There are old scores to settle. And that's just a sort of greetings card.
SPANDRELL: Shut that thing up. Runcible, we are still waiting for you to find the last sequence.
RUNCIBLE: It's here, Castellan. You can tell by the numbers.
SPANDRELL: I can tell when I see it. Take it to Records. I'll have a look at it there. I want to know all you can tell me about this Master. And I warn you know, if there is some private feud between you, do not try to settle it on Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: It cannot be avoided. Like it or not, Gallifrey is involved, and I'm afraid things will never be quite the same again. Shall we go down?
SPANDRELL: If he's a Time Lord, there'll be a DE on him in the archives.
DOCTOR: Mmm, perhaps, perhaps.
SPANDRELL: What do you mean, perhaps? There's a full biog on every Time Lord.
HILDRED: Runcible.
RUNCIBLE: I'm sorry, so sorry.
SPANDRELL: What?
RUNCIBLE: I'm sorry, so sorry.
SPANDRELL: Four cold-blooded killings in one day.
DOCTOR: Flea-bitings, Spandrell, flea-bitings. Things will get a lot worse.
SPANDRELL: Not here in the Time Lord Capitol.
DOCTOR: Well, it might rouse some of them from their lethargy. They live for centuries and have about as much sense of adventure as dormice.
ENGIN: Nothing, Castellan. There is no record of any Time Lord ever adopting that title.
DOCTOR: I told you so. If there had been a DE on the Master, the first thing he would have done would be to destroy it.
SPANDRELL: According to Coordinator Engin, the Time Lord data extracts cannot be withdrawn without the fact being recorded. I thought that yours had been scanned recently, but he assured me it was impossible.
DOCTOR: Rubbish. Anyone with a little criminal know-how could do it. I could do it myself.
ENGIN: More that criminal know-how, Doctor. Excitonic circuitry.
DOCTOR: Child's play to the Master. Do you think this stuff is sophisticated? There are worlds out there where this kind of equipment would be considered prehistoric junk.
SPANDRELL: What is the Master like on mathematics?
DOCTOR: He's brilliant, absolutely brilliant. He's almost up to my standard. What's that?
ENGIN: The APC control.
DOCTOR: APC?
ENGIN: Amplified Panatropic Computations.
DOCTOR: Brain cells.
ENGIN: Yes. Trillions of electrochemical cells in a continuous matrix. The cells are the repository of departed Time Lords. At the moment of death, an electrical scan is made of the brain pattern and these millions of impulses are immediately transferred to the
DOCTOR: Shush. I understand the theory. What's the function?
ENGIN: Well, to monitor life in the Capitol. We use all this combined knowledge and experience to predict future developments.
DOCTOR: Ah. Like the assassination of a President.
ENGIN: For some reason, that was not foreseen.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it was foreseen, Engin. It was foreseen by me. How very clever. This time he's surpassed himself.
SPANDRELL: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see what he's done? We Time Lords are telepathic. That's simply a brain storage system. He intercepted its forecast that the President was to be assassinated and beamed it into my mind.
SPANDRELL: Is that possible?
ENGIN: No.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. He could do it. You said my DE had been scanned.
SPANDRELL: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yes. He'd need a biography print to beam a message accurately over that distance. It makes sense, Spandrell.
SPANDRELL: Maybe, but why?
DOCTOR: I told you. Because he has an old score to settle.
ENGIN: Doctor, I simply cannot believe that anybody could do what you're suggesting. How can one intercept a thought pattern from within the Matrix itself?
DOCTOR: By going in there and joining it.
SPANDRELL: You mean a living mind?
DOCTOR: Well, in a sense that's all a living mind is, electrochemical impulses. If I went in there, I could discover where he intercepted the circuit.
ENGIN: I couldn't allow that. It's too dangerous. The psychosomatic feedback might kill you.
DOCTOR: I'm aware of that.
ENGIN: It's never been done.
DOCTOR: Well, it's better than being vaporised, and that's what's in store for me if I don't produce the Master.
SPANDRELL: Let him try it.
ENGIN: Well, all right.
ENGIN: Lie down.
DOCTOR: Is this what happens to the near-deceased?
ENGIN: Well, they're normally unconscious. I think there might be some pain.
DOCTOR: I'm ready when you are.
ENGIN: Are you quite sure?
DOCTOR: Get on with it.
ENGIN: It's stopped.
SPANDRELL: What?
ENGIN: Brain activity. Look, there's nothing.
SPANDRELL: You mean he's dead?
ENGIN: Virtually. I warned him the psychic shock of that environment
SPANDRELL: But he's still breathing.
ENGIN: Oh, motor functions often continue for some. He's back! His brain must have an unusually high level of artron energy.
SPANDRELL: What do you think happened in there?
ENGIN: I don't know.
FIGURE: You were a fool, Doctor, to venture into my domain.
Part Three
DOCTOR: It's an illusion. Dreams.
DOCTOR: I deny this reality. The reality is a computation matrix.
FIGURE : I am the creator here, Doctor. This is my world. There is no escape for you.
DOCTOR: I deny it. I deny it!
FIGURE : You are trapped in my creation, Doctor. My reality rules.
DOCTOR: All right, I'll fight you in your reality.
FIGURE : Then it will be a pleasure to destroy you. Be on your guard. Bwhahaha!
SPANDRELL: His respiration has increased.
ENGIN: That's an adrenaline response. And there's a massive blood sugar demand. That would suggest he's preparing either to run for his life, or to fight for his life.
SPANDRELL: But he can't, can he? Who or what is he fighting?
ENGIN: Presumably, another mind.
SPANDRELL: You mean there's another living mind in the Matrix?
ENGIN: I'm only speculating, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: Yes.
FIGURE: We have him now, but be wary. The Doctor is never more dangerous than when the odds are against him.
HUNTER:  Water. He's going to need water.
DOCTOR: No anti-tank gun.
DOCTOR: I wonder what he's been up to?
FIGURE: Stand. I have a task for you. There may be difficulties. Others may try to prevent you fulfilling my orders. You will ignore them and obey only me. You will let nothing stop you. Do you understand?
SOLIS: Yes, Master. I will obey only you.
FIGURE: This is what you will do.
DOCTOR: So that's what he was up to.
HUNTER: I'm very close to you, Doctor. You'd better start running. Do you hear me, Doctor?
SPANDRELL: Yes?
SOLIS: Message from the Chancellor, sir. He'd like the Doctor brought to him.
SPANDRELL: Solis, isn't it?
SOLIS: Yes, sir.
SPANDRELL: He's one of the Chancellor's personal guard.
ENGIN: Very well. You'll have to wait. It'll be over soon, one way or the other.
SPANDRELL: He's been in almost four minutes. How long can a living man exist in there?
ENGIN: I've no data available, but his body's on the point of collapse now. Low blood pressure, shallow respiration, carbon dioxide increasing. He can't last much longer.
DOCTOR: Must keep going. I must keep going.
HUNTER: He can't last long.
SPANDRELL: It's only a mental battle. If the Doctor's losing, why can't he just pull out?
ENGIN: It's not that simple. His adversary must have been in the matrix many times before. Hey, don't touch that!
SOLIS: Sorry.
ENGIN: He's created a mental stronghold, a dreamscape if you like. The Doctor's got caught up in it.
SPANDRELL: So he doesn't stand a chance?
ENGIN: A very slight one. His opponent is expending energy in maintaining the reality projection. The Doctor can employ all his own artron energy for defence.
SPANDRELL: Get back! Get back from
DOCTOR: Marsh gas.
MASTER: That man! One final effort. Kill him! Destroy him! I, the Master, command you!
GOTH: Where are you, Doctor? You can't win, Doctor. You might as well give up now.
DOCTOR: What do you want of me?
GOTH: Only your life, Doctor. Your life for my Master.
DOCTOR: I'll make a bargain with you.
GOTH: No bargains. Show yourself, Doctor. Get it over with. Do you hear me?
DOCTOR: No. You show yourself first. Your real self.
GOTH: Very well, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goth. All right, Goth, you win.
GOTH: Finished, Doctor. You're finished.
Part Four
MASTER: You wistful, you craven-hearted spineless poltroon. You failed me.
GOTH: Too, too strong. Too much artron energy.
MASTER: Bah. There's only one chance now.
GOTH: Master, what are you doing?
MASTER: I must trap him in the Matrix.
GOTH: No, Master, no. For pity's sake! The connections. You'll kill me.
MASTER: I've no time to waste on you.
ENGIN: The circuits!
SPANDRELL: No, you can't! If you cut the power, the Doctor will die in there.
ENGIN: But the circuits are blowing. If there's a fire, the whole panatropic net, thousands of brain patterns will be destroyed forever.
SPANDRELL: They're not alive. The Doctor is, I hope.
ENGIN: It's all right, Spandrell. He's made it.
MASTER: They've cut the net. He must be out.
GOTH: You fiend. Why did I believe in you?
MASTER: I'll cheat them yet. I'm not beaten.
DOCTOR: Do you mind? This is a non-smoking compartment.
ENGIN: What?
DOCTOR: What?
SPANDRELL: How do you feel, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Tired.
SPANDRELL: Yes, you'd better rest. You took quite a beating in there.
DOCTOR: You should see the other fellow. Where is he, by the way?
ENGIN: Who?
DOCTOR: Goth.
SPANDRELL: Did you say Goth, the Chancellor?
DOCTOR: Yes. The Master's legman. He's the assassin, Spandrell.
SPANDRELL: That's why he wanted a quick execution.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes. That's right.
DOCTOR: It was Goth, remember, who ordered my Tardis to be transducted into the Capitol. He knew I was still inside it. Goth must have his own link with the Matrix. A tap-in. We've got to trace it back to him before he recovers. What's underneath here?
ENGIN: Only service ducts.
DOCTOR: Is that all?
ENGIN: Well, a long way down, vaults and foundations dating from the old time.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. Show me.
SPANDRELL: Doctor.
DOCTOR: The Master.
SPANDRELL: Is he dead?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ENGIN: The Chancellor's still alive.
SPANDRELL: Not for long, by the look of him.
ENGIN: He must have taken the full shock.
GOTH: So, Doctor, you beat us in the end.
DOCTOR: Goth. Goth, why did you do it?
GOTH: Wanted power. Wanted to be President.
DOCTOR: But you would have been.
GOTH: President told me I was not his successor.
SPANDRELL: So you killed him?
GOTH: For him, the Master. His plan.
DOCTOR: What was his plan, Goth?
GOTH: Met him on Tersurus. He was dying. No more regeneration possible. Promised me share all his knowledge if I bring him to Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: Goth? Goth, what was his plan?
GOTH: Couldn't fight his mental dominance. Did everything he asked. Sorry now.
DOCTOR: Goth, what was
ENGIN: It's no use, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No answer to a straight question. Typical politician.
SPANDRELL: It seems clear how it happened. The Master tried to trap the Doctor in the APC net by overloading the neuron fields. Then he collapsed and died, leaving Chancellor Goth still connected into the circuit.
BORUSA: Natural causes?
SPANDRELL: Yes, sir. His body was extremely emaciated. He had come to the end of his regeneration cycle.
BORUSA: No.
DOCTOR: No what, Cardinal?
BORUSA: The story is not acceptable. This is a very difficult, very delicate position. We must adjust the truth.
ENGIN: In what way, Cardinal?
BORUSA: In a way that will maintain public confidence in the Time Lords and their leadership. How many people have seen this Master since his death?
SPANDRELL: Apart from ourselves, Hildred and the two guards who took the body to the Panopticon vault.
BORUSA: Then we shall rely on their silence. We shall change the appearance of the corpse, Castellan. We all know the posthumous effect of a staser bolt. Within the hour, the body will be charred beyond recognition. Our story is going to be that the Master arrived in Gallifrey to assassinate the President, secretly. Before he could escape, Chancellor Goth tracked him down and killed him, unfortunately perishing himself in the exchange of fire. Now that's much better. I can believe that.
ENGIN: You're making Goth into a hero?
BORUSA: If heroes don't exist, it is necessary to invent them. Good for public morale.
ENGIN: And the Doctor's part in all this?
BORUSA: Best forgotten. Of course, Doctor, the charge against you will be dropped.
DOCTOR: How kind.
BORUSA: Conditional on your leaving Gallifrey tonight.
DOCTOR: Somehow, Cardinal, I don't want to stay.
BORUSA: Good. I believe you know something of the Master's past.
DOCTOR: We've bumped into each other from time to time.
BORUSA: Then before you leave, you can assist Coordinator Engin to compile a new biog of him. It doesn't have to be entirely accurate.
DOCTOR: Like Time Lord history.
BORUSA: A few facts, Coordinator, will lend it verisimilitude. We cannot make the Master into a public enemy if there is no data on him.
ENGIN: I can have an authentic seeming data extract ready by morning, Cardinal.
BORUSA: I'll leave that to you then. Later, Castellan, we must take another look at data security. We cannot have Time Lord DEs simply vanishing from the records.
SPANDRELL: I agree, sir.
BORUSA: Well, I think that's all. You'll attend immediately to the cosmetic treatment?
SPANDRELL: Sorry?
BORUSA: The body, Castellan.
DOCTOR: Only in mathematics will we find truth.
ENGIN: What?
DOCTOR: Borusa used to say that during my time at the Academy, and now he's setting out to prove it.
HILDRED: Over there?
HILDRED: Commander Hildred, Sector seven.
SPANDRELL : A little job for you, well within your capacity. Come to the Chancellery.
HILDRED: Immediately, Castellan.
ENGIN: What about his character?
DOCTOR: Bad.
ENGIN: Oh, Doctor, could you please be a little more specific?
DOCTOR: Yes. He was evil, cunning and resourceful. Highly developed powers of ESP and a formidable hypnotist. And the more I think about it, the less likely it seems.
ENGIN: What?
DOCTOR: Well, that the Master would meekly accept the end of his regeneration cycle. It's not his style at all.
ENGIN: But that's something we must all accept, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Not the Master. No, he had some sort of plan. That's why he came here, Engin.
ENGIN: After the twelfth regeneration, there is no plan that will postpone death.
DOCTOR: He had a plan. Something to do with Goth becoming the President. What's so special about the President, Engin?
ENGIN: Nothing. He's simply an elected Time Lord, usually from some senior position. He holds the symbols of office, but otherwise he's no different from any other Time Lord.
DOCTOR: Symbols.
ENGIN: Yes. Relics from the old time. The Sash of Rassilon. The Key.
DOCTOR: Tell me about Rassilon.
ENGIN: Well, it's all in the book of the old time. But there's a modern transgram that's much less difficult.
DOCTOR: Could we hear that?
ENGIN: You mean now?
DOCTOR: Oh!
ENGIN: What is it?
DOCTOR: Engin, I can feel my hair curling, and that means either it's going to rain or else I'm on to something.
HILDRED: I understand, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: I chose you for this special mission because he's already dead. You are unlikely to miss him.
HILDRED: No, sir.
SPANDRELL: Right, off you go. Not a word to anyone.
HILDRED: Castellan, we found this in the adytum, under the chair where the body was.
SPANDRELL: Empty, but enough traces to analyse, no doubt. Thank you, Commander. And report back after you've restructured the Master.
ENGIN: And today we tend to think of Rassilon as the founder of our modern civilisation. But in his own time he was regarded mainly as an engineer and an architect. And, of course, it was long before we turned aside from the barren road of technology.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very interesting. Could we hear the transgram?
ENGIN: Early history is something of a pet subject.
WOMAN : And Rassilon journeyed into the black void with a great fleet. Within the void, no light would shine and nothing of that outer nature continue in being, except that which existed within the Sash of Rassilon.
DOCTOR: Must be a black hole.
ENGIN: What?
DOCTOR: Shush.
WOMAN : Now Rassilon found the Eye of Harmony, which balances all things, that they may neither flux nor wither nor change their state in any measure. And he caused the Eye to be brought to the world of Gallifrey wherein he sealed this beneficence with the Great Key.
DOCTOR: What's the Great Key?
WOMAN : Then the people rejoiced
ENGIN: It's an ebonite rod carried by the President on ceremonial occasions. But it's actual function, if it ever had one, is a complete mystery.
DOCTOR: Where's it kept?
ENGIN: In the Panopticon. There's a display case of relics.
DOCTOR: And the Sash of Rassilon, where's that?
ENGIN: Oh, that's held by the President. That stays in his possession.
DOCTOR: Of course. What a stupendous egotist.
ENGIN: Who?
DOCTOR: The Master. He'd have destroyed Gallifrey, the Time Lords, everything, just for the sake of his own survival.
SPANDRELL: It seems that the Master didn't die from natural causes.
DOCTOR: What?
SPANDRELL: He killed himself. Careful, it's poison.
DOCTOR: Tricophenyladehyde.
SPANDRELL: Deadly, no doubt.
DOCTOR: No. It's a neural inhibitor. Spandrell, we've been fooled.
SPANDRELL: What?
DOCTOR: The Master, he's still alive.
SPANDRELL: I've just sent Hildred to staser him.
SPANDRELL: The vault's this way.
MASTER: Bah.
SPANDRELL: Hildred. The Master, he's gone.
SPANDRELL: Look.
ENGIN: Amazing.
DOCTOR: The Master's consumed with hatred. It's his one great weakness.
MASTER: Ha. Weakness, Doctor? Hate is strength.
DOCTOR: Not in your case. You'd delay an execution to pull the wings off a fly.
MASTER: This time, Doctor, the execution will not be delayed. Castellan, I assure you I am not nearly so infirm as I look. Now you, bring me the Sash of Rassilon. Oh yes, Doctor, why else do you think I feigned death? When Goth failed me, it was necessary to more direct means. But the Sash is wasted on our dead friend, don't you think so? Bring it to me!
DOCTOR: Don't do it, Engin.
MASTER: A stupid remark, Doctor. Resistance is futile now.
DOCTOR: Don't give him the Sash, Engin.
MASTER: I have suffered long enough from your stupid, stubborn interference in my designs. Now we are coming to the end of our conflict, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Why have you brought me here?
MASTER: As a scapegoat for the killing of the President. Who else but you, Doctor? So despicably good, so insufferably compassionate. I wanted you to die in ignominious shame and disgrace.
MASTER: Now, do as I say, Coordinator, or you'll get the same.
DOCTOR: The Sash. Where's the Sash?
ENGIN: It's gone.
DOCTOR: What?
ENGIN: Well, what could I do? It's only of symbolic value anyway.
DOCTOR: Engin, that Sash is a technological masterpiece. It protects its wearer from being sucked into a parallel universe. All he needs now is the Great Key and he can regenerate himself and release a force that'll obliterate this entire stellar system.
ENGIN: You really mean it?
DOCTOR: Well of course I mean it. Don't you realise what Rassilon did? What the Eye of Harmony is? Remember? That which balances all things. It can only be the nucleus of a black hole.
SPANDRELL: But the Eye of Harmony is a myth. It no longer exists.
DOCTOR: A myth? Spandrell, all the power of the Time Lords devolves from it. Neither flux nor wither nor change their state. Rassilon stabilised all the elements of a black hole and set them in an eternally dynamic equation against the mass of the planet. If the Master interferes, it'll be the end not only of this world, but of a hundred other worlds too.
MASTER: Rassilon's star, the Eye of Harmony.
ENGIN: It's no good. We can never move it.
DOCTOR: You're right, but we've got to get out of this place.
DOCTOR: There's a light up there. Where does that lead, Spandrell?
SPANDRELL: The Panopticon. An old service shaft.
DOCTOR: Right.
ENGIN: It's a hundred feet, Doctor, at least.
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, come on, give us a bunk up.
ENGIN: What's that?
SPANDRELL: If the Doctor's right, the end of the world is approaching.
MASTER: Rassilon's discovery, all mine. I shall have supreme power over the universe. Master of all matter! Bwhahahaha!
MASTER: Doctor, my congratulations. You're just in time for the end.
DOCTOR: You're insane. You're insane, do you hear me? You're releasing a force that nothing can stop.
MASTER: Take the Rod. You can take it with you to your grave, except that none of you will need a grave.
DOCTOR: If you undo that, you'll die as surely as any of us.
MASTER: You can do better than that, Doctor. Even in extremis, I wear the Sash of Rassilon.
DOCTOR: Yes, and the President was wearing it when he was shot down. The Sash won't protect you. It's damaged.
MASTER: You lie.
BORUSA: Half the city in ruins. Untold damage, countless lives lost.
ENGIN: But for the Doctor it could have been much worse.
BORUSA: Yes indeed, I am conscious of the debt we owe the Doctor. But Gallifrey has never know such a catastrophe, such devastation. What will we say?
DOCTOR: Well, you'll just have to adjust the truth again, Cardinal. What about subsidence owing to a plague of mice?
BORUSA: As I believe I told you long ago, Doctor, you will never amount to anything in the galaxy while you retain your propensity for vulgar facetiousness.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir. You said that many times, sir. May I go, sir?
BORUSA: Certainly you may, preferably with the utmost expedition. Perhaps you will see that the transduction barriers are raised, Castellan.
SPANDRELL: Yes, sir.
BORUSA: Oh, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Sir?
BORUSA: Nine out of ten.
DOCTOR: Oh. Thank you, sir.
ENGIN: You know, Doctor, if you wanted to stay, I'm sure any past difficulties could be overlooked.
DOCTOR: But I like it out there, thank you very much.
SPANDRELL: The barriers are raised, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Spandrell.
ENGIN: It's we who should thank you, Doctor, for destroying the Master.
DOCTOR: Well, I didn't actually see him fall, you know. I was quite busy.
ENGIN: Oh, but if by some miracle he survived the fall into that chasm, he was dying anyway.
DOCTOR: There was a good deal of power coming out of that monolith, and the Sash would have helped him to convert it.
SPANDRELL: Are you suggesting he survived?
DOCTOR: No, no, I hope not, Spandrell. And there's no one in all the galaxies I'd say that about. The quintessence of evil. Goodbye, Spandrell.
SPANDRELL: Goodbye, Doctor.
ENGIN: Goodbye, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Oh, goodbye, Engin, goodbye.
SPANDRELL: Look, the Master.
ENGIN: Where do you think they're heading?
SPANDRELL: Out into the universe. But, you know, I have a feeling it isn't big enough for the two of them.)
MASTER: Bwhahahaha!
