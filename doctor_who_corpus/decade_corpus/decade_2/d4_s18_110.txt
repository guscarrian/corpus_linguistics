Meglos
Part One
 
DOCTOR: You'd better stop the Tardis. We don't want any nasty jolts. Prion, did you say?
ROMANA: We're in the Prion planetary system. We'd better land.
DOCTOR: No, no. Hovering will do.
ROMANA: There's a planet called Tigella.
DOCTOR: Tigella? Never heard of it.
ROMANA: Well, there's one called Zolfa-Thura. That's in the history books.
DOCTOR: Well, we're all in somebody's history books.
ROMANA: A great civilisation blown away to sand and ashes.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.
ROMANA: Now all that's left is the Screens.
DOCTOR: Why, what screens?
ROMANA: The Screens of Zolfa-Thura.
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, those screens. Well, of course I've been to Tigella. Did you say Tigella?
ROMANA: That's right.
DOCTOR: I've been there.
ROMANA: When?
DOCTOR: Oo, well, a long time ago. Nice chap called Zastor showed me around. Yes. Remind me to get in touch with him sometime. In fact, I'll do it right now.
ROMANA: No, no, no. Please, please, can we just do one thing at a time?
DOCTOR: First things first?
ROMANA: Exactly.
DOCTOR: But not necessarily in that order. Tigella. Zastor.
CARIS: It's going to blow!
CARIS: Emergency! Emergency!
DEEDRIX: And quickly.
WOMAN : Burn out on one four nine. Medical and lighting assistance immediately.
DEEDRIX: Medical detail dispatched.
MAN 2 : Air purification unit one malfunctioning.
DEEDRIX: Open up air vents three to eight in unit one. Zastor.
ZASTOR: This is no time for formality. Please continue.
MAN 3 : Irrigation levels holding steady.
DEEDRIX: Thank you. Clearing. 
ZASTOR: Well, how bad is it, Deedrix?
DEEDRIX: We can't control it much longer.
ZASTOR: So much for science.
DEEDRIX: Without detailed investigation, there's nothing science can do.
ZASTOR: Believe me, I understand.
DEEDRIX: I've always argued
ZASTOR: That's certainly true.
DEEDRIX: For thousands of years our lives have been dominated by a mystery. The Dodecahedron belongs to all of us, not just the Deons.
ZASTOR: Their religion deserves respect.
DEEDRIX: Religion. Control to walkway nine.
DEEDRIX : Update on the burnout, please.
CARIS: I'm replacing the transformer. There'll be no power in here for the next three hours. Now will they believe us?
DEEDRIX: Thank you, Caris. Understood. All this rather proves her point.
ZASTOR: How can we re-inhabit the surface? It would take years of preparation.
DEEDRIX: Decades, more likely. There are better ways, but at least she has a rational plan.
ZASTOR: Which the Deons have declared a blasphemy.
DEEDRIX: You could overrule them.
ZASTOR: How long would I remain leader if I were to?
DEEDRIX: And Tigella? Zastor, I tell you as a savant, a scientist, one who works hard to understand these things, that our safe and bountiful city may well be on the edge of total extinction.
LEXA: No.
LEXA: Zastor is our leader, but he cannot lead us into sacrilege. Resume the Concurrence. I shall explain this yet again to Zastor.
ZASTOR: I understand your anger, Lexa.
LEXA: The power is angrier than we are.
ZASTOR: But at the moment seems to be a little more controlled. So perhaps should we be. The savants are trying to help, or so they believe.
LEXA: Believe? A word to large for their small minds.)
LEXA: They're children. Wilful, ignorant and lost.
ZASTOR: As we all will be, savants and Deons alike, if the power fails us.
LEXA: Why are we going to the debating chamber? This is hardly a matter for compromise.
ZASTOR: I'm an old man, Lexa, with less faith perhaps than you, but I think you trust my judgment.
LEXA: Yes.
ZASTOR: They have some proposals. They will not touch the Dodecahedron.
LEXA: They cannot enter the Power room!
ZASTOR: Some measurement, a few calculations.
LEXA: Oh, not even you, Zastor, can revoke the ancient laws.
DEEDRIX: And your Concurrence, Lexa, cannot revoke the laws of physics.
ZASTOR: Deedrix, Lexa, we must behave like leaders.
DEEDRIX: Then lead us by example, Zastor. Make a decision!
ZASTOR: I cannot interfere. I was afraid it would come to this.  Yes, please, ask him to come.
LEXA: Ask? Who?
DEEDRIX: Some new procrastination, Zastor?
ZASTOR: Some fifty years ago, I knew a man who solved the insoluble by the strangest means. He sees the threads that join the universe together and mends them when they break.
DEEDRIX: A savant? Or one of her madmen.
ZASTOR: A little of each and a great deal more of something else. He's nearby and asking to visit us.
DEEDRIX: You sent for an alien?
LEXA: Why?
ZASTOR: You'll know when you see him. This probably needs his delicacy of touch.
DOCTOR: He'd better not go in the sea in future. He's likely to get into deep water, you know.
ROMANA: It was hardly his fault that someone neglected to sea-proof him.
DOCTOR: Quite. Can you remember where I left his manual?
ROMANA: Yes, of course.
ROMANA: Oh, I hope he's going to be all right. We're going to need him on Tigella.
DOCTOR: Why? They're not hostile.
ROMANA: The plants are. Lush, aggressive vegetation.
DOCTOR: You mustn't believe everything you read in books.
ROMANA: It says in the history books that it was the lush, aggressive vegetation that forced the Tigellans to retreat beneath the surface. You must have seen it last time you were there.
DOCTOR: It was reasonably friendly to me. Mind you, it was a long time ago.
ROMANA: Post repair test questions.
DOCTOR: Ahem. Post repair test questions. K9, can you hear me?
K9: Affirmative,  mistress.
DOCTOR: That's a promising start.
ZASTOR: Silence! Savants, Deons, remember the dignity of your high office. Have we been elected to squabble? If we cannot agree, we will at least have order.
DEEDRIX: I've said all I have to say. I am needed back in the control room.
LEXA: No! The Savants should be arrested for heresy.
DEEDRIX: And crushed to death, no doubt.
ZASTOR: Please, you will not mock the old laws.
DEEDRIX: Well, how can there be any respect for a creed that practices primitive sacrifice. Are you making sacrifices now in the name of your monstrous myth?
ZASTOR: Please, Deedrix, remember where you are.
DEEDRIX: No! This should be said before all Tigella. The Dodecahedron is no god! It is an artefact! Engineered.
LEXA: It descended from the heavens!
DEEDRIX: Not the heavens. From somewhere, anywhere, but not the heavens.
LEXA: Then where?
GRUGGER: Well?
BROTADAC: Sand. Nothing but sand. The whole planet.
GRUGGER: Except for those.
BROTADAC: Bring an Earthling to the screens of Zolfa-Thura. I never liked this job.
GRUGGER: Male Caucasian around two metres tall.
BROTADAC: Right, we've delivered him. So who pays us?
GRUGGER: Shut up. He's trying to say something.
BROTADAC: It could be a trap. What does he know, anyway?
EARTHLING: Nothing. I don't know anything. What have I done?
GRUGGER: Nobody knows anything.
EARTHLING: Why? Why me?
GRUGGER: Why any of us? Do you think I do this through choice? Oh, give him another one.
GRUGGER: The message was genuine. We'll wait.
BROTADAC: Genuine? We don't even know who sent it. Let's kill him and go.
GRUGGER: Let's think, for a change. Now, why would you send across the galaxy for a thing like that?
BROTADAC: Stop! It must be a trap.
GRUGGER: Shut up and follow me.
MEGLOS : Arrival noted, gentlemen. Welcome. Don't be afraid.
GRUGGER: Huh. Who do you think you're talking to?
MEGLOS : General Grugger, Lieutenant Brotadac, I presume, together with their band of fortune hunters. There should also be an Earthling somewhere.
GRUGGER: You. What are you?
MEGLOS : Ah, forgive me. Most remiss. I am Meglos, only survivor of this planet.
MEGLOS : Well observed, General Grugger. I am the plant. A xerophyte, to be precise. Ah! Ah, you've served me well, General Grugger. I now have a real proposition for you.
ZASTOR: This chamber will yield to my authority!
DEEDRIX: You've lost it, delegated it to these aliens.
LEXA: A Time Lord! A non-believer. Why should we trust him?
ZASTOR: The Doctor's good faith is beyond question.
DEEDRIX: Faith! That word again. What we need is knowledge!
ZASTOR: He brings that, too.
DEEDRIX: We have it here, if you will allow us to use it.
LEXA: Oh, squabbles go round and round. Nothing is decided here. I shall seek guidance from the Power itself.
CARIS: I have something to say to this chamber
LEXA: No.
ZASTOR: Caris has risked her life to save this city. I wish to hear her.
CARIS: Even if we manage to restore the power, or as the Deons would say, if the power condescends to restore itself, the food stocks will be destroyed. We will have to ascend to the surface.
BROTADAC: It's a waste of time. Let's get our payment and go.
MEGLOS : You Gaztaks pillage the galaxy. There are a thousand small marauding bands like yours. And what's it all for?
BROTADAC: Loot!
MEGLOS : A motley collection of trophies. How long did it take you to accumulate?
BROTADAC: Done it all our lives.
MEGLOS : Pah! And you accuse me of wasting your time.
GRUGGER: What you're asking us to do is impossible.
MEGLOS : Impossible, or simply beyond your comprehension?
BROTADAC: There's only one way into that city.
GRUGGER: And they guard that Dodecahedron with their lives. To them, it's a god.
BROTADAC: They say the thing's dangerous to touch.
MEGLOS : Really, gentlemen, I have considered the hazards. But your timidity worries me. You're not interested in the real power. So, if Lieutenant Brotadac will return my redimensioner, we will conclude our business.
GRUGGER: What?
MEGLOS : The redimensioner you removed from my desk.
GRUGGER: Oh, you fool. What do you know about mass conversion mechanics?
GRUGGER: I want to know a lot more about all this.
DOCTOR: Bit of a nuisance if we have to reprogramme all his constants.
ROMANA: I'm more worried about the power depletion. At this rate he's going to need recharging every two hours.
DOCTOR: That's not a problem. I happen to be an expert in power sources.
ROMANA: Tigella won't take long, then.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. A quick flight, a quick service.
ROMANA: What is the energy process, baryon multiplication?
DOCTOR: Erm, er, yes. Yes, something like that. They didn't actually let me see it last time. Religious objections.
GRUGGER: The Dodecahedron was made here on Zolfa-Thura?
MEGLOS : Of course. The Tigellans are using only a fraction of its potential.
GRUGGER: A fraction! It powers their entire planet.
MEGLOS : Precisely. A mere fraction. The verdant fluctuations are part of its inbuilt programming. In restart mode it's present output will be raised to the power of twelve. It's energy could feed an entire galaxy.
GRUGGER: That's impossible.
MEGLOS : Within your limited frame of reference, yes. Now, if you will be so kind as to proceed.
MEGLOS : General Grugger, have I explained the procedure sufficiently?
GRUGGER: Yes, it's all right. It's this lever first and then that one to start the process.
MEGLOS : Excellent. Then let it commence.
GRUGGER: Oh, we'll definitely let it commence.
BROTADAC: This is the switch, is it?
GRUGGER: Don't touch these controls, Brotadac.
BROTADAC: Come on, he looks ready to me.
GRUGGER: Yes, he does, doesn't he?
BROTADAC: Well, what's the hang up? I want to get off of this planet.
GRUGGER: Get the others. So do I, but it would be a pity to leave all this.
BROTADAC: You got a plan?
GRUGGER: We can take that, and that, and that. How much will all that be worth in Pallagos?
BROTADAC: Fifty million credits?
GRUGGER: Oh, that's very nice.
BROTADAC: We struck lucky.
GRUGGER: Lucky? Brains, Brotadac, brains. I think the four of us could dismantle that.
BROTADAC: We could break that one up.
GRUGGER: No, no, that's a nice piece.
BROTADAC: I'll go and get the others.
GRUGGER: I've already sent for them. Why aren't they here? Go and see what's happened to them.
BROTADAC: It's stuck!
GRUGGER: Well, open it.
BROTADAC: But it won't open.
GRUGGER: What do you mean, it won't open. It won't open.
BROTADAC: It opened all right when we come in. Automatically.
MEGLOS : Correct, gentlemen. Automatically.
GRUGGER: He's trapped us.
BROTADAC: Didn't trust us.
MEGLOS : Oh, nothing so petty. I knew that as, what shall we say, ardent pragmatists, you would feel bound to attempt some variation of our arrangement. I wanted it to come sooner rather than later. I know you and your kind so well, and if we are to cooperate, I want you to know me.
GRUGGER: I see. Well, that's all right.
MEGLOS : Well, gentlemen, shall we all descend together into the earth for another thousand years or shall we resume our original arrangements?
GRUGGER: Well, I'm prepared to forget that little incident.
MEGLOS : Oh, I hope not.
BROTADAC: We'll remember.
MEGLOS : Good. Now, the second button, please.
BROTADAC: I don't believe it!
MEGLOS: Thank you, General Grugger. Now we must work quickly. I've intercepted a Tigellan message. They've sent for a travelling Time Lord.
MEGLOS: Who's travels I must interrupt. Now, where is he, and when?
ROMANA: Where did you put the magnetic tweezers?
DOCTOR: In a cave. A sort of shrine.
ROMANA: Where?
DOCTOR: In Tigella. What?
ROMANA: Magnetic tweezers?
DOCTOR: Oh.
ROMANA: Thanks. I think I've almost done it.
DOCTOR: Mind you, it's hardly surprising they're in awe of the thing. After all, their whole way of life depends on it.
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ROMANA: Well, now his probe circuit's jammed.
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
ROMANA: All right. We've tried everything else.
K9: Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete.
DOCTOR: Well done, Romana. Well done. You're becoming very accomplished at all this.
ROMANA: Becoming? I was fully qualified when I arrived.
DOCTOR:  K9, what do you know about the Prion planetary system?
K9: The only viable civilisation was Zolfa-Thura. They destroyed themselves in global war. Planet now featureless desert.
ROMANA: Good boy, K9.
DOCTOR: So now Tigella's all that's left.
K9: Affirmative.
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ROMANA: Well, now his probe circuit's jammed.
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
ROMANA: All right. We've tried everything else.
K9: Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete.
MEGLOS: Flies trapped in amber. Not even the Doctor can escape a chronic hysteretic loop.
GRUGGER: A what?
MEGLOS: I've caught him inside a fold of time.
GRUGGER: Huh? Oh, good.
MEGLOS: His only respite is the short period when he loops back to the start. Round and round, for all eternity.
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ROMANA: Well, now his probe circuit's jammed.
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
ROMANA: All right. We've tried everything else.
K9: Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete.
DOCTOR: That's the third time. What's happening?
ROMANA: The Tardis appears to be functioning normally.
DOCTOR: Yes. Then what? Repeated time cycles? Oh, no. It couldn't be a chronic hysteresis, could it?
ROMANA: Chronic hysteresis!  I hope not. If it is, we'll be stuck here forever.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
BROTADAC: This Meglos can bend time.
GRUGGER: Right, in a loop.
BROTADAC: I've never heard of that, have you?
GRUGGER: It doesn't matter how it's done. The point is, the Doctor doesn't get to Tigella.
MEGLOS: Oh, but he does, gentlemen. He does.
 
MEGLOS: We mustn't disappoint the Tigellans.
Part Two
DOCTOR: It's no good. Every time we try to
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ROMANA: Well, now his probe circuit's jammed.
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
ROMANA: All right. We've tried everything else.
K9: Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete.
ROMANA: What can we try now? K9, is there any way out of a chronic hysteresis?
K9: Negative, mistress. No known technological procedure.
DOCTOR: We're still looking.
ROMANA: What if we stop the time rotor?
DOCTOR: Yes. No. That's a terrible idea.
ROMANA: I'm only trying to help.
DOCTOR: There's no known technological procedure. I'm sorry to whisper. There's no known technological procedure. There's no known technological procedure.
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
BROTADAC: Tigella, twenty seconds to atmospheric entry. Activating heat shields.
MEGLOS: Ha. Heat shields. How fascinating.
GRUGGER: They work. If it wasn't for us you'd still be in Zolfa-Thura.
BROTADAC: I've got a geographical fix on the main entrance. You want to land there?
GRUGGER: No. Jungle landfall a little to the north.
BROTADAC: Stand by for landing. Entering foliage now.
ZASTOR: Well, Lexa?
LEXA: You will not be pleased.
ZASTOR: So your prayers have not been answered?
LEXA: The Time Lord may visit us.
ZASTOR: Then you will allow him to inspect the Dodecahedron?
LEXA: On one condition. He must take the Deon oath.
ZASTOR: Take the Deon? No, Lexa. That would be an insult to our guest.
LEXA: Your guest.
ZASTOR: You cannot make a Time Lord swear allegiance to Ti.
LEXA: Once again, Zastor, you can impress us with your diplomacy.
GRUGGER: Right, we'll wait here for about an hour.
MEGLOS: One hour exactly.
GRUGGER: And we'll come and get you if anything goes wrong.
MEGLOS: Goes wrong? General, you know sometimes I think you forget who I am.
BROTADAC: That man could do anything. What a mind! Anything.
GRUGGER: Don't think too hard, you'll burst something.
BROTADAC: And I like his coat.
DEEDRIX: The moment he arrives, Caris will bring him to us.
LEXA: Having filled his head with scientific nonsense, I presume.
MAN : Temperature rising in food store.
DEEDRIX: I hope your friend the Doctor will appreciate our difficulties.
ZASTOR: The Doctor has the maturity to respect many points of view.
CARIS: We could inhabit the surface again. If this Doctor fails us, we may have to.
MEGLOS: I'm the Time Lord. The Doctor. You were expecting me?
CARIS: Oh, yes, indeed. You're most welcome. Please, follow me.
MAN : Central storage banks overloading. Shall I close off receptor panels?
DEEDRIX: No, not yet. Reroute surplus to section five. They have spare capacity.
LEXA: The oath-taking ceremony is prepared.
DEEDRIX: What? You're making him take the oath? Zastor, this is ridiculous.
ZASTOR: It's got to be done, Deedrix.
CARIS: Zastor.
ZASTOR: Doctor! It is good to see you again.
MEGLOS: Again?
ZASTOR: It's been a long time. I'm Zastor, now the Tigellan leader.
MEGLOS: Oh yes, of course, yes, I remember you very well.
ZASTOR: You haven't changed much, Doctor. A little older, a little wiser.
MEGLOS: Oh, much wiser. I gather your energy source is behaving somewhat capriciously.
DEEDRIX: Capriciously? It's out of control.
MEGLOS: Excuse me. Excuse me.
MEGLOS: An absorption system, I presume?
DEEDRIX: Yes, there's a series of receptor panels placed above the Dodecahedron and radiated energy is measured there.
MEGLOS: And these screens can be closed down?
DEEDRIX: Well, yes, the central storage banks would contain enough energy for one hour, but it is extremely dangerous.
MEGLOS: One hour is all I'll need. Turn them off.
DEEDRIX: Close down receptor panels until further notice.
MEGLOS: Good. Now show me the Dodecahedron.
ZASTOR: Surely you remember the way, Doctor?
MEGLOS: Ah. Yes, of course. But now that you're leader, I'll follow you.
LEXA: Before entering the Power room, you must take the Deon oath.
ZASTOR: A mere formality, Doctor.
LEXA: Will you swear allegiance to Ti, Doctor?
MEGLOS: I, swear allegiance to Ti? I'll swear allegiance to Ti with great pleasure. I'm flattered to be so honoured. Please, lead the way.
ROMANA: Oh blast, here we go again.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ROMANA: Well, now his probe circuit's jammed.
DOCTOR: Well, that's easy. Just waggle his tail.
ROMANA: All right. We've tried everything else.
K9: Thank you, mistress. Repairs complete.
ROMANA: We can't get out of it. We've tried everything.
DOCTOR: Yes. That's what you said when you were repairing K9. You'd tried everything. Tried everything. We've tried everything. Of course!
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: Can you remember the rest of what you said?
ROMANA: I should think so, we've been through it enough times.
DOCTOR: K9?
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: Then that's how we'll do it. Throw it out of phase.
ROMANA: You mean go through the motions deliberately?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, before the cycle comes back again.
ROMANA: Well, you were over there.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: Over there.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. Good. Off you go, then.
ROMANA: Oh blast here we go again.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
ROMANA: Now his probe circuit's jammed.
DOCTOR: Ah. That's easy. Just waggle his tail.
ROMANA: All right. We've tried everything else.
K9: Thank you, mistress.  Repairs complete.
ROMANA: Phase cancellation. We've done it!
DOCTOR: Well done. You know, for one awful moment I thought you'd forgotten your lines.
LEXA: Neither to transgress the laws of the Dodecahedron.
MEGLOS: Neither to transgress the laws of the Dodecahedron.
LEXA: Thanks be to Ti.
ALL: Thanks be to Ti.
LEXA: You are now free to enter the Power room.
DEEDRIX: Thanks be to Ti.
MEGLOS: People of Tigella, what I have to do is extremely dangerous.
ZASTOR: In what way?
MEGLOS: To control the output, it will be necessary to increase the violence of the emissions.
DEEDRIX: Then you'll be in danger yourself.
MEGLOS: Well, hardly. I'm a Time Lord. Having lived in the future I can hardly die in the present.
DEEDRIX: That can't be true. That's a philosophical paradox.
MEGLOS: No, it's merely beyond your comprehension. However, all of your lives are in danger.
ZASTOR: Then we must leave.
MEGLOS: Precisely.  Only I, only I must enter the Power room.
LEXA: But it was agreed that I should accompany him, on the god's behalf.
MEGLOS: But now I have the protection of Ti himself, we must not appear to mistrust that blessing.
LEXA: So be it.
DOCTOR : Well, according to my calculations, this should be sector eight of the city.
ROMANA : Ah.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: Well, if this is the city, I can only assume we're in some sort of park.
K9 : Master?
DOCTOR: This place has grown up a bit since I was last here.
ROMANA: Where is the city, then?
DOCTOR: That way.
K9: Twenty two degrees north, thirty six point four degrees west.
DOCTOR: Right.
ROMANA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes? Ah, yes, well, anyone can make a mistake.
MEGLOS: Ten thousand years.
DOCTOR: Well, I only got the direction wrong because of Tigella's anticlockwise rotation.
K9: Anomaly.
ROMANA: What is it, K9?
K9: Partial incineration of vegetation evident.
ROMANA: Nonsense, K9. These leaves are burnt.
K9: Mistress.
DOCTOR: Come on, there's no time for botany.
ROMANA: Now what would cause that? Thinness of the atmosphere?
K9: Negative, mistress. Projection of Dodecahedron power insufficient. Foliation scanning period now terminated, mistress. Expedition necessary.
LEXA: What are you doing here, Caris?
CARIS: Let go. Look, it's vital we understand what's happening inside there.
LEXA: You were ordered to stay out of this area.
CARIS: And so were you, Lexa.
LEXA: Get back.
CARIS: What's happened to the light?
LEXA: What!
DOCTOR: Hello there, I'm the Doctor. I'm expected.
GUARD: I didn't see you go out.
DOCTOR: What?
GUARD: This is the second time you've been in here.
DOCTOR: I say, you've got a marvellous memory. It must be fifty of your years since I was last here. Romana? K9, do you know where she is?
K9: Master.
DOCTOR: Then run and fetch her, and tell her to hurry.
K9: Master.
CARIS: It's not possible.
ROMANA: Urgh, bell plants. Very nasty. Now I see why they live underground.
ROMANA: More scorching.
ZASTOR: Vanished?
CARIS: We watched the Doctor leave and, the Power room's empty!
ZASTOR: But that's inconceivable!
DEEDRIX: This is Control. Activate receptor panels.
DEEDRIX: It's dead. It's dead. There's no power down there.
ZASTOR: Where's the Doctor?
LEXA: He's betrayed us.
ZASTOR: Now wait a minute. Tell me exactly what happened.
LEXA: No, there isn't time. Out of my way.
LEXA: This is a Control command. This is a Control command.
LEXA : Arrest the Time Lord. Stop him at all costs. He must not be allowed to leave the city.
DOCTOR: That's odd. I could have sworn Central Control was this way. Ah. Excuse me, I'm the Doctor. I'm expected.
DOCTOR: Well, will you just tell people I've arrived?
DEEDRIX : Stop the Time Lord. Stop the Doctor. Take him at all costs.
DOCTOR: That's very impressive. It's not exactly what I expected, but it's very impressive.
LEXA: There he is. Take him.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's all right, I'm a doctor.
LEXA: Where is the Dodecahedron.
DOCTOR: I don't know. I don't even know where Central Control is. Zastor, how good to see you. Will you tell them who I am?
LEXA: I know who you are.
ZASTOR: Doctor, what's happened?
DOCTOR: Please, please, stay calm. I'm sorry I'm late. We could have been here earlier, but for the chronic hysteresis. That's a sort of time loop, you see.
LEXA: We?
DOCTOR: Yes, my assistant. She'll be along in a minute. Anyway Zastor, how are you?
ZASTOR: Baffled, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah.
ZASTOR: You'd better come with us.
DOCTOR: But what about Romana?
LEXA: Oh, never mind about them. Take him away!
ROMANA: So that's what caused the burning.
ROMANA: Oh! I do beg your pardon.
K9: Mistress? Mistress? Response negative. Batteries require recharge. Returning to the city.
BROTADAC: She's seen too much. Kill her!
Part Three
GRUGGER: Ah ha. Who is she?
BROTADAC: I found her here.
GRUGGER: She's not a Tigellan. Where are you from?
ROMANA: If I told you, you wouldn't understand.
GRUGGER: Try.
ROMANA: Let go and I'll tell you. Thank you. My ship landed here by mistake.
BROTADAC: Let's kill her. Meglos won't like it.
GRUGGER: I'm handling this, not Meglos. What ship?
ROMANA: I'll show you if I can find it.
GRUGGER: All right. Move. Go on.
CARIS: And then we waited outside. We saw the Doctor leave, and when we came in here the Dodecahedron was gone.
DEEDRIX: But how long was he here?
CARIS: Moments. Hardly any time.
DEEDRIX: It's incomprehensible. There's no way that I know of, singlehandedly moving an object like that.
CARIS: An object like what?
DEEDRIX: The Dodecahedron, of course.
CARIS: What was it like? Oh yes, we can define its shape and size and colour, and from up there we could estimate its output, but what do we really know about it?
DEEDRIX: Over the years we've formed theories about how it works.
CARIS: The source of all our energy, the heart of our civilisation, a device we've become totally dependent upon, and all we know about its internal structure are a few vague theories.
DEEDRIX: Yes, and all because of these Deons. When the Doctor came in here, you're certain he was alone?
CARIS: Completely.
DEEDRIX: So how!
MAN : Central Control to Deedrix. Central Control to Deedrix. Power drain is reaching critical.
CARIS: Critical! The whole city will collapse. How many times have I told the Chamber
DEEDRIX: We should be on the surface. yes, yes, I know. Come along, I'll need you too.
GRUGGER: That's our spacecraft! You've been leading us round in circles.
DEEDRIX: Essential services only. Close down all other sections.  I'm reducing lighting and cutting thermostat temperature to minimum.
CARIS: Giving us?
DEEDRIX: About two hours, but hurry!
DOCTOR: What, you mean completely disappeared? Evaporated?
LEXA: What did you do?
DOCTOR: Well, as I recall the Dodecahedron, it was much too large to move.
ZASTOR: Can't you see you've paralysed our city?
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.
LEXA: Answer me. What happened to the Dodecahedron?
DOCTOR: I keep telling you, I don't know. I've only just arrived.
LEXA: But I saw you.
DEEDRIX: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DEEDRIX: Whatever reasons you had for doing this, the fact remains that without the Dodecahedron's energy, in two hours time this city will be dead.
DOCTOR: In two hour time.  You saw me? You saw me?
GRUGGER: Now, you tried to trick us. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you now.
ROMANA: Anticlockwise rotation.
BROTADAC: What?
ROMANA: I forgot that the planet rotates in an anticlockwise direction.
BROTADAC: What's she talking about?
GRUGGER: Rotation, direction, revolving.
BROTADAC: Oh.
GRUGGER: Well, what difference does that make?
ROMANA: Don't you see? If we'd gone the other way, we wouldn't have come back to the same point.
GRUGGER: Ah. No. Well, I'll give you one last chance, and you'd better get it right. Move!
MEGLOS: I need you back in.
EARTHLING: Let go of me! You've no right!
MEGLOS: Quite right, but academic.
LEXA: Even if this girl exists, it will prove nothing.
ZASTOR: And he won't even admit to taking the Deon oath and entering the Power room.
DOCTOR: I think I see the problem.
DEEDRIX: I'm going to seal off the city. We'll search every area.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, wait. Wait! Wait. There are three possibilities.
ZASTOR: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: One, the chronic hysteresis. I've never been in one before but it just might have projected a time image of me. It's theoretically possible, isn't it?
LEXA: You'll have to do better than that, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah.
LEXA: I think you're a fraud and a liar.
DOCTOR: Well, that makes even less sense.
LEXA: Oh? Why?
DOCTOR: Well, you see, I just don't do that sort of thing.
ZASTOR: And the third possibility?
DOCTOR: I think what we've got here is a good old-fashioned doppelganger.
CARIS: I'll deal with this. Go to section four food bays and turn off the ray lamps.
DEEDRIX: Ice forming in the sub-corridors. I can't keep essential services running, Zastor. We'll have to evacuate.
ZASTOR: One moment. I want to trust you, Doctor, but how can I doubt my own eyes?
DOCTOR: Well, that's the problem with doppelgangers, you see. You never know who's who.
LEXA: Confine him. He must not be permitted down there again.
ZASTOR: No, Lexa. Very well, Doctor. This time we will go to the Power room together.
DOCTOR: Right, and let's hope that many hands will make the lights work.
LEXA: No, Zastor. There is another way.
CARIS: But why should I lead you out of the city, Doctor?
MEGLOS: Well, precisely because I'm not the Doctor.
CARIS: Then who are you?
MEGLOS: I am Meglos! The last Zolfa-Thuran.
CARIS: The dead planet?
MEGLOS: Yes!
CARIS: But why should that make me obey you?
MEGLOS: Because of this.
CARIS: But that's impossible!
MEGLOS: Yes, the ultimate impossibility.
LEXA: It is not in anger, believers. Although we have cause for anger, we will act in justice. Ezrith, come with me. The rest of you do nothing until I give the word.
BROTADAC: How much more of this, General?
GRUGGER: Shut up.
BROTADAC: Look at this jacket.
GRUGGER: Girl, how much longer is there of this?
ROMANA: I don't know. It is extremely hard to navigate on a planet that rotates anticlockwise. However, I'm pretty certain that it's this way. Or is it that way. No, no, no, no. It's definitely this way.
DEEDRIX: Deons. What are they up to?
LEXA: Follow us.
DOCTOR: It would have to be solid, assuming some process like baryon multiplication.
DEEDRIX: Well, yes, we always presumed it would be heavy.
DOCTOR: Huh, heavy? Assuming an atomic weight of two hundred, not even a dozen Tigellans could have carried it away.
DEEDRIX: So where is it?
LEXA: There's no question about where it is. It's been taken back by the god.
ZASTOR: What is this, Lexa?
LEXA: We are taking over. In order to pacify the god, all non-believers will be collected and exiled to the surface.
ZASTOR: But they won't survive out there, Lexa. You can't
LEXA: Take him away.
ZASTOR: No, Lexa, you need me as an advisor. I've been a believer all my life. You can't do this.
LEXA: Faith dwells in the deeds, Zastor, not in the words.
DEEDRIX : He's an old man, Lexa. The plants will kill him!
DOCTOR: Just how dangerous are the plants?
LEXA: Ultimately? Lethal.
DOCTOR: Ah. In that case I must hurry. I've got a friend on the surface.
LEXA: No, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No?
LEXA: You are going to bring back the Dodecahedron.
DOCTOR: I am? Well, I'd be delighted to help in the ordinary way.
LEXA: No, Doctor, not in the ordinary way.
DOCTOR: Not in the ordinary way.
LEXA: No. Prepare him for sacrifice.
ROMANA: Wait.
BROTADAC: We said we'd wait for Meglos.
GRUGGER: He'll be back. Stop panicking.
BROTADAC: How do we know there is a ship?
GRUGGER: If she's lying, she dies.
ROMANA: Ow! Don't keep doing that. I know I landed very close to here!
WOMAN : Closing the city exit. Closing the city exit.
ROMANA: K9? K9. Do something.
K9: Mistress.
ROMANA: Oh, come on. I can't just leave you there.
BROTADAC: What do we do now?
GRUGGER: We're going in.
CARIS: You can't get out now. They've sealed the exit.
MEGLOS: No, there's been a change of plan. There's a ventilation shaft on the second landing.
CARIS: That's no good to you now. We've closed them all down to preserve the heat.
MEGLOS: You're lying, of course.
CARIS: You're trapped. We're all trapped. Lexa's in control.
MEGLOS: No, we'll make for the main entrance. No one can stop me now.
EARTHLING : Are you sure?
MEGLOS: What! Earthling? You again?
MEGLOS: It's no use struggling. You can't escape. No, Earthling, no. It will kill you.
EARTHLING: Nothing could be worse than this.
MEGLOS: What, a hero and a fool? You're a very dangerous combination, Earthling.
CARIS: Whoever or whatever you are, you're coming with me.
GUARD: Urgent, urgent. Come in, Central Control.  Into position. Ready to fire.
GUARD: Out of the way! Pull her clear!
ROMANA: Stay there. I'll find someone to recharge you.
ROMANA: The Doctor?
GRUGGER: Bah, you're useless.
MEGLOS: Come on, let's go.
ROMANA: Doctor? What is he doing?
CARIS: That wasn't the Doctor.
MEGLOS: Well, General?
GRUGGER: Well? We waited one hour.
BROTADAC: Precisely.
GRUGGER: Shut up. And what's happened? Nothing. It's a catastrophe. You've failed.
GRUGGER: The Dodecahedron!
BROTADAC: I knew he could do that. How did you do that?
GRUGGER: We told him how to do it.
MEGLOS: Gentlemen, gentlemen. This is only the beginning.
LEXA: Faith, Deons. We can restore the Dodecahedron by offering the angry god an exchange for its return. His life for the great light that illuminates us all.
BROTADAC: We've done it! We've done it! A complete success!
GRUGGER: We're taking off, Brotadac. If you want to come with us, I suggest you close the doors.
BROTADAC: Oh, er.
MEGLOS: Well done, Brotadac. Destination Zolfa-Thura, I think, General.
GRUGGER: I hope it was all worth it, Meglos.
MEGLOS: Oh, I think you'll find this will replace the odd torn jacket, hmm?
MAN : The Doctor has escaped. The doors are breached. All guards to the gate immediately.
ROMANA: But if that was Meglos, what about the Doctor?
CARIS: You're sure he's here?
ROMANA: Positive.
CARIS: Then where is he?
LEXA: Oh great gods of Ti, we offer you this sacrifice and beseech you to restore the Dodecahedron once more to shine in Tigella. Thanks be to Ti.
ALL: Thanks be to Ti.
Part Four
CARIS: Zastor! The Doctor!
ZASTOR: Has escaped. We heard.
ROMANA: No, that was Meglos.
DEEDRIX: The doppelganger.
ROMANA: You should be up on the surface. You're under attack.
ZASTOR: Go!
DEEDRIX: The Power room.
ZASTOR: Stop the sacrifice! Stop it!
LEXA: Heretic! Take him out!
ROMANA: It's the wrong Doctor!
CARIS: The other one's escaped. We saw him.
LEXA: You are forbidden in the Power room!
ZASTOR: There are two of them. He's innocent.
GUARD: The Gaztaks have withdrawn.
DEEDRIX: Yes, and the man you want's gone with them.
LEXA: Gaztaks? Is this true?
DOCTOR: Won't somebody please say yes?
GRUGGER: I lost fifty percent of my crew on Tigella.
MEGLOS: Three men? That's the price of success, General.
GRUGGER: You would never have done it but for us.
MEGLOS: You'll be rewarded. Both of you. All the power you need.
GRUGGER: Take over, Brotadac.
BROTADAC: General.
GRUGGER: One day I will go back to Tigella with an army.
MEGLOS: Unnecessary. Unnecessary with this.  It's potential has scarcely been touched.
BROTADAC: Approaching Zolfa-Thura.
GRUGGER: Approaching full potential.
MEGLOS: Precisely. Precisely.
CARIS: I saw him holding the Dodecahedron, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, but what does this Meglos want?
CARIS: He talked about taking it back to the dead planet.
DOCTOR: Zolfa-Thura? Why would he want to do a thing like that?
ROMANA: There's nothing there except sand.
DOCTOR: Right.
ROMANA: And the screens.
DOCTOR: Screens? What screens?
ROMANA: The Screens of Zolfa-Thura.
DOCTOR: Of course. The Screens of Zolfa-Thura.
BROTADAC: What's he doing now?
GRUGGER: I can't tell just yet.
BROTADAC: Buried it?
GRUGGER: Hmm.
BROTADAC: Do you think he'd let me have that?
GRUGGER: What, the coat? You want it? Not cold, is it.
BROTADAC: It's a rather nice coat. Now that he's finished playing the Doctor
MEGLOS: Well, gentlemen, we are ready.
GRUGGER: What happens next?
MEGLOS: Activation.
MEGLOS: Now to see it work.
ZASTOR: Good luck on Zolfa-Thura, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Zastor. Come on, Romana, we're in a hurry.
LEXA: Romana!
DOCTOR: She's dead.
ROMANA: She saved my life.
DOCTOR: Yes, but we've got other things to do, other lives to save. Come on.
MEGLOS: My fellow Zolfa-Thurans tried to destroy all we had and all we knew to prevent this moment.
GRUGGER: The Screens area absorbing the power.
MEGLOS: Magnifying it. Concentrating it. The five beams they throw out can be made to converge on any point in the galaxy.
BROTADAC: And blast it?
MEGLOS: To infinitesimal dust. Brotadac, you're a discerning sort of fellow. Choose a planet, any planet.
GRUGGER: Oh, make your own mind up for a change.
BROTADAC: I don't know.
MEGLOS: And you, General Grugger? What's your choice?
GRUGGER: Tigella. Let's start with Tigella.
ROMANA: Well done, we're very close.
DEEDRIX: It's lighting up the whole sky!
DOCTOR: Right, now, you all stay here.
ROMANA: You can't go alone.
DEEDRIX: The Gaztaks kill on sight.
DOCTOR: Exactly. On sight. If Meglos can impersonate me
ROMANA: You can impersonate Meglos.
DOCTOR: Right. I won't be long.
MEGLOS: Final adjustment for relative motion.
MEGLOS: Well, gentlemen, the beams are now programmed to focus upon Tigella.
BROTADAC: Start the countdown?
MEGLOS: Patience!
MEGLOS: Brotadac, we are about to release a power many magnitudes greater than any intelligence has ever controlled.
BROTADAC: We are?
MEGLOS: There can be no room for error. I'll just recheck the screen alignments.
DOCTOR: Shirt sleeves, eh?
GRUGGER: Put it on.
BROTADAC: What will he say?
GRUGGER: It doesn't matter. I've got this all figured out. We don't need him. Put it on.
GRUGGER: That was quick.
DOCTOR: Well, I cut a few corners. I say, I like his coat. Now, what have we got here?
BROTADAC: Start the countdown?
DOCTOR: Not yet, not yet.
GRUGGER: I thought it was already programmed.
DOCTOR: Programmed?
GRUGGER: To annihilate Tigella.
DOCTOR: Oh, well, it is, yes, it is. Nearly. Just a few minor adjustments. I wonder what that's for?
GRUGGER: You said it focused the beams.
DOCTOR: Oh, of course, yes. Of course.
GRUGGER: Two coats?
MEGLOS: Splendid. The magnification levels are constant. One more check and we're ready to go.
DEEDRIX: The Screens. It's unbelievable.
CARIS: I'd like to have a closer look.
ROMANA: I think we should. Come along, K9.
DOCTOR: You've served me so well I thought you both deserved a little treat.
GRUGGER: So it's now just the countdown and activation.
DOCTOR: That's it.
GRUGGER: Good. Let's get on with it.
BROTADAC: Sixty. Fifty nine.
DOCTOR: No, no, Brotadac, no. The Screens don't reach their maximum capacity for two minutes. I'm just going outside for a little stroll to see if I can catch up with myself. And I don't recommend anyone touch those controls.
GRUGGER: Get him.
BROTADAC: What?
GRUGGER: Yes. Put him in the spacecraft security hold. We can manage without him. Get him! That's yours too, if you want.
BROTADAC: Oh. Get him!
MEGLOS: Shouldn't you be doing something?
DOCTOR: Oh! Nasty.
DOCTOR: That could have been me.
BROTADAC: What are they playing at?
DOCTOR: Ooof!
BROTADAC: Get him into the ship.
ROMANA: I knew he wouldn't get away with it. They've got the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
BROTADAC: Stay there! If he tries anything, kill him.
CARIS: What are we going to do now?
MEGLOS: Ten thousand years. Cretins. Morons. Half-wits.
DOCTOR: Yes, they've not been very clever, have they, unlike us.
MEGLOS: They probably won't even hit Tigella.
DOCTOR: Well, if my calculations are correct, they certainly won't.
MEGLOS: Your calculations?
DOCTOR: I inverted your control setting. If he starts the countdown, he'll destroy himself, as well as you and me and, well, the whole planet, of course.
BROTADAC: Locked away, no trouble.
GRUGGER: Precisely. Prepare the countdown.
ROMANA: Go, K9.
ROMANA: He must be in there. K9, can you open it?
K9: Affirmative, mistress.
MEGLOS: Three metres by five metres, and I could have had the galaxy. The universe.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. I've often puzzled about that.
MEGLOS: What!
DOCTOR: Well, why a good looking chap like you should want to control the universe.
MEGLOS: Why?
DOCTOR: Yes. I mean, it baffles me, this burning ambition to. Burning?
MEGLOS: It's beyond your comprehension.
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely. Burning?
ROMANA: Doctor? Oh, good heavens.
MEGLOS: Out of my way.
DOCTOR: No, Meglos. Hold him!
MEGLOS: You can't take me.
EARTHLING: Got you this time, Meglos.
MEGLOS: On the contrary, Earthling, it's merely you they've got.
EARTHLING: What's happened? What's going on?
ROMANA: Was that Meglos?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: He must have modulated himself on a particular wavelength of light.
DOCTOR: Yes. He's what you'd call a colourful personality.
ROMANA: But that would make him virtually indestructible.
DOCTOR: Yes, but we're not. Quick, back to the Tardis. Or do you want to be atomised?
EARTHLING: Atomised?
DOCTOR: Yes.
EARTHLING: No.
DOCTOR: Good.
GRUGGER: Thirty seconds to beams converging.
BROTADAC: Twenty nine. Twenty eight. Twenty seven. Twenty six.
BROTADAC : Twenty five.
DOCTOR: You're not going to let us down this time, are you, old girl.
BROTADAC : Twenty four. Twenty three. Twenty two. Twenty one. Twenty.
BROTADAC: Nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen.
BROTADAC: Fifteen, fourteen
BROTADAC : Thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine.
DOCTOR : It's time this thing had a thorough overhaul.
BROTADAC : Seven, six
BROTADAC: Five.
GRUGGER: We're moving.
BROTADAC: Four point five.
GRUGGER: The laboratory's sinking.
BROTADAC: Sinking four.
BROTADAC : Five, four
MEGLOS : Stop the countdown.
BROTADAC : But the clock says
MEGLOS : Stop the clock!
GRUGGER : It must be this button.
MEGLOS : Stop the countdown! Stop the clock!
GRUGGER : It must be this button.
MEGLOS : Fool! Stop!
ZASTOR: Well, we've made a beginning, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'd like to stay and help you, but horticulture's not my strong point.
ROMANA : Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
ROMANA: Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: They want us back immediately.
DOCTOR: Gallifrey? Do they, indeed. Well, we'll see about that when we've dropped our friend off home. Unless, of course, you want to stay here and do some gardening?
EARTHLING: Maybe I will. I'll be in trouble back home.
DOCTOR: Oh?
EARTHLING: I told the wife I'd be in from work in twenty minutes.
DOCTOR: Well, don't worry about that. We can get you back before you leave.
EARTHLING: Oh, good.
