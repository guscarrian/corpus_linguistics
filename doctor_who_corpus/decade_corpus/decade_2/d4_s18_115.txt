Logopolis
Part One
ADRIC: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Chameleon circuit.
ADRIC: What? Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, whenever you see me in this part of the Tardis, pacing up and down like this, be a good chap and don't interrupt me, will you, unless it's terribly urgent. It's not terribly urgent, is it?
ADRIC: Well, no.
DOCTOR: Good, so now you'll know in fact there's no need for you to come barging in here at all, but if it is terribly urgent you can always ring the Cloister Bell.
ADRIC: The Cloister Bell?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: What's that?
DOCTOR: Well, it's a sort of communications device reserved for wild catastrophes and sudden calls to man the battle stations.
ADRIC: But the Tardis doesn't have battle stations.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, nothing along those lines. I sometimes think I should be running a tighter ship.
ADRIC: A tighter ship?
DOCTOR: Yes. The second law of thermodynamics is taking its toll on the old thing. Entropy increases.
ADRIC: Entropy increases?
DOCTOR: Yes, daily. The more you put things together, the more they keep falling apart, and that's the essence of the second law of thermodynamics and I never heard a truer word spoken. Come on. Come on.
DOCTOR: Have you seen the state of the time column recently? Wheezing like a grampus.
ADRIC: But it will get us to Gallifrey, won't it?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey? Oh yes, yes. Are you really set on going to Gallifrey?
ADRIC: Yes.
DOCTOR: Oh.
ADRIC: That is where we're going, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That's one of the questions I was just pondering. There's bound to be an awful lot of fuss about Romana. Why she stayed in E-space, official investigations, that sort of thing.
ADRIC: The Time Lords won't approve?
DOCTOR: What? She has broken the cardinal rule of Gallifrey. She has become involved, and in a pretty permanent sort of way. I think that you and I should let a few oceans flow under a few bridges before we head back home.
ADRIC: So we don't get to go to Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: Yes. Let me put another question to you. I have a place in mind that's on the way, well, more or less, give or take a parsec or two. It's my home from home. It's called Earth.
TEGAN: Passport.
VANESSA: Oh, she's going to go back in there. Forget her head if it wasn't screwed on, I tell you.
VANESSA: There we go.
TEGAN: Okay, Aunty Vanessa, let's go. More choke. Easy on the throttle as you turn her over.
VANESSA: While I do that, dear, I wonder if you'd mind shutting the front door.
VANESSA: And don't forget your bag. You might need it.
TEGAN: Rats. I promise I'll get organised one day.
VANESSA: Now calm now, Tegan, dear. Look, we've got plenty of time. You get yourself so excited.
VANESSA: Wish you and I had half her energy, though.
TEGAN: Sorry, Aunty. First flight nerves, I guess. Here, let me have a go.
VANESSA: That's a good idea. I'm not having any luck here with it at all this morning. It's really very cold.
TEGAN: It's cold.
VANESSA: There we are. Got all your things? Right.
TEGAN: I've got the knack.
VANESSA: You sure have.
TEGAN: Ladies and gentlemen. Although the fasten seatbelt sign is now off, we suggest that you keep your seatbelt fastened when seated. If necessary, you may move about the cabin. Smoking is now permitted.
ADRIC: Earth's the planet with all the oceans, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That's the chap.
ADRIC: Wet.
DOCTOR: Britain is. That's the one place where we can find these blue boxes.
ADRIC: Tardises?
DOCTOR: Yes, but they're not. No spacious accommodation, no viewer screens. They don't even time travel. Just elementary Earth communications devices, and more or less obsolete by the time we'll be arriving there. There's some in the North that are still in use.
ADRIC: But we've got communications devices.
DOCTOR: But not a police box.
ADRIC: A police box?
DOCTOR: Yes. What the mathematical model of a Tardis exterior is based upon.
ADRIC: I'd like to see Earth, but why go all that way just to look at something that looks like the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Because I want to measure it.
ADRIC: Whatever for?
DOCTOR: Block transfer computation.
ADRIC: I've never heard of that.
DOCTOR: I'm not surprised. Logopolis is a quiet little planet.
ADRIC: Logopolis? But I thought we were going to Earth?
DOCTOR: No, that's the other place. We go to Logopolis afterwards.
ADRIC: You mean we're going to measure Logopolis, too?
DOCTOR: No, no, no. It's all to do with the chameleon circuit problem. We measure the police box on Earth, then we take the measurements afterwards to Logopolis. Come on, I'll show you.
ADRIC: What is it?
DOCTOR: The Cloister Bell.
ADRIC: It's stopped.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: Well, what does it mean?
DOCTOR: Well, nothing, when it's not ringing.
ADRIC: But it did ring. Is there a wild catastrophe?
DOCTOR: Apparently not.
ADRIC: Well, something must have made it ring.
DOCTOR: Yes, or else our old friend entropy's nibbling away at the system circuitry. Let's take a look.
ADRIC: But you were saying about the chameleon circuit.
TEGAN: Hell's teeth, Aunty Vanessa. It is a flat.
VANESSA: I thought there was something funny about that steering, but you wouldn't listen to me.
DOCTOR: Well, it's only the exterior of a Tardis that exists as a real space-time event.
ADRIC: But mapped on to one of the interior continua.
DOCTOR: Precisely. That's very good.
ADRIC: So you can change it into anything you like.
DOCTOR: Ah, well, that's a sore point. According to the handbook, yeah, because the outer plasmic shell of a Tardis is driven by the chameleon circuit, or so the theory runs. In practice I always meant to ask Romana to help me fix it one day.
DOCTOR: Ah. I suppose we're going to miss Romana.
ADRIC: And K9, too.
DOCTOR: Yes. Still, the future lies this way.
TEGAN: Come on, Aunty. We've got to do something.
VANESSA: Yeah. Telephone for help.
TEGAN: Absolutely not. Cars. I hate 'em.
VANESSA: That's not what you said when I offered you a lift.
TEGAN: Sorry, Aunty, but you just don't get this sort of silly aggravation with aircraft.
VANESSA: Well, perhaps if we sit here and look helpless, someone might offer us a lift.
TEGAN: Pathetic. We'll crack this ourselves. Now then.
TEGAN: Where's the wheel spanner?
ADRIC: So the chameleon circuit's stuck?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
ADRIC: In Totter's Yard.
DOCTOR: In a totter's yard. Anyway, it was ages ago. It doesn't matter. She was in on Gallifrey for repair when I borrowed her.
ADRIC: I thought she was yours?
DOCTOR: Well, on a sort of finders-keepers basis, yes. I should have waited till they'd done the chameleon conversion, but there were other pressing reasons at the time. Anything happening up there?
ADRIC: No.
ADRIC: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good. Ah.
ADRIC: What do these numbers and letters mean?
DOCTOR: Well, it's an early version. The instructions have to be punched in by machine code.
ADRIC: Oh, how boring.
DOCTOR: Boring? In theory we should be able to do things like this.
DOCTOR: There. You have a door there.
ADRIC: Yes, I suppose that's useful.
DOCTOR: Well, we've got to be able to get in and out.
ADRIC: No, no, I mean being able to change like that.
DOCTOR: That's how the Master hid from us on Traken. Anyway, if this worked, I'd just have to punch a few buttons like this, and we'd be a pyramid.
ADRIC: It's very distinctive.
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm not sure we should be distinctive.
ADRIC: Why? Who's looking for us now? You've disposed of the Master.
DOCTOR: Yes. But since we left Traken, and then the Cloister Bell.
ADRIC: Wild catastrophe?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
ADRIC: Man the battle stations?
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah, Earth. Nearly there.
VANESSA: Completely remove the wheel-nuts, remove the hub trim, exchange the road wheels and replace the hub trim and wheel-nuts. Oh, dear.
TEGAN: Now that's what I call travelling.
VANESSA: You and your aeroplanes. I sometimes think you should have been born with wings.
TEGAN: Oh, rabbits.
VANESSA: By the way, dear, don't you think you should put a jack underneath there before you take that wheel off?
DOCTOR: We've missed.
ADRIC: What's supposed to happen?
DOCTOR: At least, I suppose it's a miss, but I thought just for once we'd materialise on the right coordinates.
DOCTOR: Two point six metres off target. What a landing.
ADRIC: It's not bad for the Tardis.
DOCTOR: That's what I just said. What a landing. No, no, no, no. Don't open the door.
ADRIC: Aren't we going out there to measure it?
DOCTOR: There's no need to draw attention to ourselves. There's a simpler way, if I can just organise it. The Tardis and I are getting rather better at these short hops.
ADRIC: It's just like the Tardis!
DOCTOR: I hope not. That could produce some unpleasant dimensional anomalies. No, it's just an ordinary police box, around which we've materialised with considerable finesse, I hope you've noticed.
ADRIC: Police telephone, free for use of
DOCTOR: No, no, no, leave it alone.
DOCTOR: It's a communications device. Adric, take down these dimensions. I've been meaning to do this for centuries.
VANESSA: It's nearly done.
TEGAN: I don't really belong at ground level, Aunt Vanessa.
VANESSA: Yeah.
TEGAN: I didn't mean to be rude about your car. It's very nice of you to give me a lift to the airport.
VANESSA: My little runabout's used to being insulted by now.
TEGAN: Cars are all right, I guess. Just more fun to have your own plane back home. What kind of a maintenance schedule are you running here, Aunty Vanessa? This tyre's flat, too.
DOCTOR: Three point six seven metres normal to the back surface.
ADRIC: How much more of this is there?
DOCTOR: It has to be measured in every dimension.
ADRIC: But it can't have thirty seven dimensions! You said it was an ordinary Earth object.
DOCTOR: In every dimension. I need every detail. The Logopolitans convert that into a precise mathematical model.
ADRIC: Why?
DOCTOR: Well, to overlay it on the Tardis.
ADRIC: And that's block transfer computation.
DOCTOR: Well, it's a way of modelling space-time events through pure calculation.
ADRIC: Really?
DOCTOR: No, transcendentally. It's quite hard to explain in a word.
ADRIC: Creating solid objects through pure mathematics.
DOCTOR: Yes. I meant to do it all of course when they first offered to do the chameleon conversion for me. It's highly specialised. But they say it'll work. Leg up.
VANESSA: Oh, please, dear, do let's get a man from the garage.
TEGAN: No way. The stories I've heard about the way they exploit helpless women. You want the job done well, you do it yourself, that's what Dad used to say.
VANESSA: Perhaps some knight errant will stop for us.
TEGAN: You have to learn to fend for yourself in the outback, you know.
VANESSA: Your father's farm is hardly the outback, my dear, and neither is this. You know, I can see a garage not even a quarter of a mile away.
TEGAN: Industry and application, Aunt Vanessa. Air stewardesses are supposed to be resourceful.
VANESSA: You're not an air stewardess yes, dear.
TEGAN: I will be after today.
VANESSA: If ever we get to the airport.
TEGAN: We will, just as soon as I get this wheel off.
VANESSA: Oh, god. You know, I thought I saw a man hovering over there. Perhaps he needed a wave of encouragement.
TEGAN: It's the 1980s, Aunt Vanessa. No knight errants.
ADRIC: So why do we have to go to Logopolis if the theory's as simple as you say?
DOCTOR: Because the actual working-out's incredibly tedious. Lots of fiddly computations. Much better to leave it to the Logopolitans. They do it standing on their heads.
ADRIC: Not with a computer?
DOCTOR: Standing on their heads is an expression.
ADRIC: Oh.
DOCTOR: As a matter of fact, they don't use computers, they use word of mouth.
ADRIC: Is that another expression?
DOCTOR: No.
ADRIC: They speak it?
DOCTOR: Mutter. Intone.
ADRIC: Intone the computations?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: Why?
DOCTOR: I've wondered that myself. I never quite had the nerve to ask them.
DOCTOR: Another instrumentation failure.
ADRIC: A gravity bubble?
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Definitely a gravity bubble. Pretty local too, by the look of it.
ADRIC: Is that dangerous?
DOCTOR: Well, we'd better not dematerialise till I've investigated. I have a feeling I'm overlooking the obvious again. Back in two shakes.
DOCTOR: What are you doing, Adric?
ADRIC: I thought it might have something to do with the gravity bubble.
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid you're right. No! You'd better leave this to me.
DOCTOR: Get back to the Tardis.
ADRIC: But this is the Tardis.
DOCTOR: A Tardis, perhaps.
ADRIC: It looks just like yours.
DOCTOR: Yes, down to the last detail. No, wait, wait.
DOCTOR: This could be terribly dangerous. You'd better stay with me.
VANESSA: There you are, Tegan, dear. I've got the knack too.
TEGAN: I wish there was a knack to blowing up a spare tyre with a hole in it. Really, Aunt Vanessa, what's the point in driving around with a dud spare tyre?
VANESSA: It's the garage, then.
TEGAN: Crooks and swindlers, but I suppose we've got no choice.
VANESSA: Unless we wait for a knight errant?
TEGAN: No, thank you. Look, you stay here and get your breath back, and I'll go.
VANESSA: Take your bag, dear. You might have to pay for it. Ah, there's a girl. Good girl.
TEGAN:  Police telephone, free for use of public. Advice and assistance obtainable immediately. Officers and cars respond to urgent calls. Pull to open.
TEGAN: That's funny. It's very peculiar indeed.
ADRIC: So it is another Tardis.
DOCTOR: It's too early to tell.
DOCTOR: There are other things that can cause this sort of dimensional anomaly. See if you can do that again.
TEGAN: Hello? Anybody there?
TEGAN: Well, there must be intelligent life at the end of this lot.
TEGAN: Hello? Anybody receiving me? Hello? Come in, anybody. My name's Tegan Jovanka. I'd like to speak to the pilot.
TEGAN: Is that the crew in there?
VANESSA: Tegan? Goodness me.
ADRIC: How many more of these are there?
ADRIC: It couldn't be an infinite regression, could it?
DOCTOR: I hope not, because if it is, we'll never get out of it.
DOCTOR: Here, you do it.
ADRIC: Listen.
VANESSA: No!
ADRIC: Someone's trying to get in touch with us.
DOCTOR: We can't go back now.
ADRIC: Done it.
DOCTOR: We must be getting near to the nucleus of the bubble.
ADRIC: What's causing it?
DOCTOR: Another Tardis.
ADRIC: What? Materialising round the police box just as we planned to do?
DOCTOR: Yes. Someone's been here before us. Stay here, Adric.
DOCTOR: Ah, good morning.
DETECTIVE: Good morning. This your vehicle?
DOCTOR: Which vehicle?
DETECTIVE: The sports car.
DOCTOR: No.
DETECTIVE: Ah.
DETECTIVE : I just wondered how you came to be here. There is only the road, after all.
DOCTOR : It isn't easy to explain.
DETECTIVE: Well, while you're trying to work that one out, perhaps you'd like to explain this?
DOCTOR: So he did escape from Traken.
DETECTIVE: I think you'd better come along with us.
DOCTOR: But he's still about, somewhere.
DETECTIVE: He, sir?
DOCTOR: Yes. The Master.
Part Two
DOCTOR: Now just a minute, officer. You don't realise what's going on here.
DETECTIVE: No, sir, and I don't want to have to go into detail. You want to think yourself lucky that I don't have to be the judge.
DOCTOR: Me lucky? You don't think that I? You do think.
DETECTIVE: I'm not paid to have opinions, sir. I'm paid to do my duty.
DOCTOR: Well, I do have opinions. This is the calling card of the most evil genius in the universe and I have to tell you gentlemen, I've got to get after him. Now, if you'll just help me to create a diversion, hmm?
DETECTIVE: I think you'd just better come along to the station with us, sir.
DOCTOR: I'd love to.
DETECTIVE: Just to assist us in our enquiries.
DOCTOR: Would you mind awfully if I stopped to telephone my solicitor?
DETECTIVE: You can do that back at the station.
DOCTOR: It seems we're going to be awfully busy at this station of yours. I mean, isn't that a telephone box?
DETECTIVE: That's a police box, sir, not for
DOCTOR: But that would do fine, don't you agree?
DETECTIVE: Look, sir, if you want a formal arrest
DOCTOR: Er, no.
ADRIC: Help! Help me, please! Quickly! Help! Please help!
ADRIC: Help!
DETECTIVE: Get him, Davis!
ADRIC: Help!
DETECTIVE: Not that one, you fool! The other one!
ADRIC: The box has gone.
DOCTOR: It could be anywhere in the Tardis.
ADRIC: Battle stations?
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
DETECTIVE: Come on now, sir.
ADRIC: The Cloister Bell!
DOCTOR: A choice of emergencies. We'd better dematerialise first.
ADRIC: What's the matter?
DOCTOR: The Tardis is very sluggish. We may not have any choice at all.
DETECTIVE: Get the key.
DOCTOR: It's dragging us back. We'll have to find some more power from somewhere.
ADRIC: The Cloister Bell!
DOCTOR: Well, shut the door, then. There must be some way of simplifying this. Architectural configuration, that's the one.
ADRIC: What's that?
DOCTOR: Interior allocation of space. Adric, I'm going to jettison Romana's room.
ADRIC: Are you sure?
DOCTOR: This is life. Nothing's sure.
ADRIC: I'm sorry, I just
DOCTOR: Look, do you want a quick decision or a debate?
ADRIC: Sorry!
DOCTOR: You see? There's no need to shout.
ADRIC: We're moving.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: So that other Tardis really has gone.
DOCTOR: Somehow I rather doubt that. Come on, Adric.
ADRIC: But aren't you going to answer the Cloister Bell?
DOCTOR: Why don't you answer it? Go on. Go on.
DETECTIVE: There's got to me some trick to this, Davis.
TEGAN: This place is unreal.
ADRIC: Doctor, it stopped.
DOCTOR: Yes, so now we know.
ADRIC: Know what?
DOCTOR: The message was very faint. It was from Traken.
ADRIC: Traken? How's Nyssa?
DOCTOR: Nyssa's all right.
ADRIC: Tremas?
DOCTOR: Vanished. The Master must have had a second Tardis hidden away somewhere.
ADRIC: The Master's escaped from Traken? But why take Nyssa's father?
DOCTOR: To renew himself. He was very near the end of his twelfth regeneration.
ADRIC: He's taken over Tremas?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: Can a Time Lord do that?
DOCTOR: Well, not just a Time Lord by himself, but with some of the powers of the Keepership still lingering. Huh, and I was so sure. I was so sure. He must have known I was going to fix the chameleon circuit.
ADRIC: He read your mind?
DOCTOR: Well, he's a Time Lord! In many ways, we have the same mind.
ADRIC: Are we still going to Logopolis?
DOCTOR: No, how can we with the Master in the Tardis? They're a retiring people. They like a quiet life. There's no telling what a creature like that would do on Logopolis.
ADRIC: So how do we flush him out?
DOCTOR: And there's no saying what that might do to the Tardis systems. Can you swim?
ADRIC: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good. Materialise the Tardis underwater and open the door.
DOCTOR: That's the River Thames. We'll put down there.
ADRIC: And water sluices in and floods out the whole Tardis.
DOCTOR: Yes. Adric, shut down everything. Fold back the Omega configuration.
ADRIC: Folded back.
DOCTOR: Good. Exponential cross-field?
ADRIC: Halted.
DOCTOR: Good. Pathways to conditional states seven to seventeen?
ADRIC: Closed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Main and auxiliary drive?
ADRIC: Ended.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, we're partially materialised, so there'll be a slight jolt. Are you ready?
ADRIC: If you are.
DOCTOR: What? Well, I'd feel more confident if you just said yes.
ADRIC: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good. Here we go, then.
TEGAN: This is too much!
DOCTOR: A gentle splash-down.
DOCTOR: We must have touched bottom.
ADRIC: Touched bottom?
DOCTOR: Yes. Good thing the water was there to break our fall.
TEGAN: Crazy idiot of a pilot! Wait till I have a word with him.
TEGAN: Who's that?
DOCTOR: Careful, now. The water pressure could send us both flying. Ready?
ADRIC: Yes.
DOCTOR: Now!
DOCTOR: That's odd. There's no pressure on those doors at all.
ADRIC: Perhaps we aren't down very deep.
DOCTOR: Ah. I thought there's be a perfectly simple explanation.
ADRIC: Nearly got it right.
DOCTOR: Nearly, but not quite right. There's something not quite right about all of this.
ADRIC: The Master.
DOCTOR: Nothing like this has ever happened before. I've got to get to the bottom of this. You stay here.
TEGAN: I definitely came in this way. So this must be the way out.
TEGAN: Round and round like a hamster in a cage! Somebody must be in charge here!
TEGAN: We'll just have to give it one more go.
DOCTOR: Door.
ADRIC: Who was that? Doctor, who was that?
DOCTOR: Set.
ADRIC: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Logopolis.
ADRIC: What?
DOCTOR: I've just dipped into the future. We must be prepared for the worst.
ADRIC: So that was the Master?
DOCTOR: Hmm? How do you deduce that?
ADRIC: I just guessed.
DOCTOR: Never guess. Unless you have to. There's enough uncertainty in the universe as it is.
ADRIC: But I can help you. Well, can't I?
DOCTOR: In the ordinary way, yes. This is something far too serious.
ADRIC: What sort of something?
DOCTOR: A chain of circumstances that fragments the law that holds the universe together.
ADRIC: Logopolis?
DOCTOR: Yes. That aerial's a recent addition.
ADRIC: Are we going to be staying long?
DOCTOR: You are.
ADRIC: What?
DOCTOR: You and I have to part company.
ADRIC: Look, if you're going after Nyssa, I'm coming too.
DOCTOR: Adric, don't argue.
TEGAN: I demand to see whoever's in charge of this ship!
TEGAN: Tegan Jovanka. And I'm not answering any more questions until you tell me exactly who you are.
ADRIC: I'm Adric. That's the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Who is she? Where did she come from? What are we going to do with her?
TEGAN: You can take me right back where you found me, Doctor whoever you are. My aunt's waiting in the car to take me to the airport.
DOCTOR: Your aunt? Woman in the white hat, red sports car?
TEGAN: You've seen her?
DOCTOR: Well, a little of her. That settles it. She's got to come with us.
TEGAN: Settles what? Now wait a minute, Doctor.
MONITOR: My dear Doctor. Logopolis is honoured by your visit.
DOCTOR: Well, it's very nice of you to put it like that, Monitor.
TEGAN: I demand to know what's
DOCTOR: Shush. We're all very honoured to be here.
TEGAN:  Where's here?
DOCTOR: Logopolis.
MONITOR: Welcome. Time has changed little for either of us, Doctor. You continue to roam the universe, while we persist in our simple existence on this planet.
DOCTOR: Yes. The antenna's new, Monitor.
MONITOR: Occasionally our researches require what is sometimes called technology. But for the most part, our computations are enough.
DOCTOR: If your computations can help solve a problem in my Tardis, I'd be eternally grateful, Monitor.
MONITOR: You have recorded the dimensions we need as data?
DOCTOR: Yes, all noted down. Monitor, I don't wish to press you but my problem is now extremely urgent.
MONITOR: It will only take a moment.
MONITOR: Why don't we proceed to business immediately?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: But all this is new, Monitor, and vaguely familiar.
MONITOR: This is purely for our advanced researches.
ADRIC: I thought you said they didn't use computers.
DOCTOR: That's right.
MONITOR: May I have the dimensions?
DOCTOR: Yes, historically the Logopolitans do everything
MONITOR: The dimensions, Doctor.
MONITOR: This will only take a moment.
MONITOR: Keree gorok gorok, keree gorok per denesta zel octa zarel gorok gorok keree
TEGAN:  What's he doing?
DOCTOR: The numbers. He's recreating the Tardis.
MONITOR: The code is being compiled.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Monitor. I'm certainly looking forward to having a properly functioning Tardis.
ADRIC: You mean those people we saw in the streets are working it out for themselves?
MONITOR: Yes.
ADRIC: What, without technology?
MONITOR: Block transfer computation is a complex discipline, way beyond the capabilities of simple machines. It requires all the subtleties of the living mind. Is that not so, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, indeed, Monitor, indeed.
TEGAN: When am I going to get an explanation for all this?
DOCTOR: Do you really feel up to an explanation?
TEGAN: I'll try.
DOCTOR: Well. Adric, you explain.
ADRIC: It's not the Doctor's fault you wandered aboard.
TEGAN: Wandered? Listen, that ship was deliberately disguised as a police box. I just want to know who you are and where I am.
ADRIC: Look, I'd better explain.
MONITOR: This will restore your chameleon circuit, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Splendid, Monitor. I've really been looking forward to this. Of course! The Pharos Project! But this is a near replica of the Pharos computer room.
MONITOR: It is a perfectly logical copy.
DOCTOR: What?
MONITOR: I always thought you underestimated the possibilities of block transfer computation, Doctor. You see, structure is the essence of matter, and the essence of structure is mathematics.
DOCTOR: What, you can model the Pharos Project mathematically?
MONITOR: Of course, and supply the necessary raw energy.
DOCTOR: Well, then, you can model any space-time event in the universe.
MONITOR: That is true. Now, shall we implement the solution to your little problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes.
ADRIC: What's a Pharos, Doctor?
TEGAN: Ancient Greek for lighthouse.
ADRIC: What's a lighthouse?
DOCTOR: A famous Earth project to transmit signals to remote planets.
MONITOR: I understand they're trying to get intelligent life to respond.
DOCTOR: Ah.
DOCTOR: Monitor, I must ask you a very special favour.
MONITOR: My dear Doctor, of course.
DOCTOR: Adric and the girl. Would you look after them for me?
MONITOR: You don't want them with you in the Tardis?
DOCTOR: No. What lies ahead is for me, not for them. I hate farewells.
MONITOR: There is a chance the computation may produce an instability.
ADRIC: The Doctor's in danger?
MONITOR: A simple precaution. There is very little that could go wrong. In fact, nothing at all.
ADRIC: But he said he was expecting danger.
MONITOR: I must confess, I misled the Doctor in order to have the pleasure of your company while he engages in this mundane task. Now, perhaps you would like to see more of Logopolis.
TEGAN: I'd prefer to see a lot less of it. Can you give me some idea how long we're going to be delayed here?
ADRIC: I'm sorry. She's upset.
TEGAN: Too right I'm upset. Wouldn't you be?
NYSSA : Adric!
TEGAN: I've got a job to do.
NYSSA: Adric.
ADRIC: Nyssa! How did you get here?
NYSSA: A friend of the Doctor's brought me. He's here, somewhere.
TEGAN: Who's Nyssa?
ADRIC: She's the friend who helped me on Traken.
NYSSA: Is the Doctor here?
ADRIC: In the Tardis.
TEGAN: Hi, I'm Tegan. Did they hijack you, too?
ADRIC: What's the matter?
MONITOR: Transfer instability. It may be only temporary.
ADRIC: Something's wrong.
MONITOR: Yes, you're right.
TEGAN: It's getting smaller.
ADRIC: Can't you do something?
MONITOR: I don't understand. I don't understand.
ADRIC: But the Doctor's in there!
Part Three
ADRIC: It's your codes that are doing this.
MONITOR: This is unheard of.
TEGAN: Well, how do we get him out of this?
MONITOR: A fault in the computation?
ADRIC: There must be something you can do to put him right.
MONITOR: Take the machine to the Central Register.
NYSSA: What are you going to do with it?
MONITOR: The Central Register, quickly. There may still be time. The honour of Logopolis is at stake.
DOCTOR: Must dematerialise. Dematerialise. Nothing working. Nothing.
TEGAN: Will he be all right, Monitor?
MONITOR: If we can trace the error in time.
MASTER: At last, Doctor. At last I've cut you down to size.
NYSSA: Hold on, Doctor. The Monitor is going to help you.
TEGAN: What's he doing?
MONITOR: The fault is in the dimensioning routine. We can trace it, if there's time.
ADRIC: Can I help?
MONITOR: Perhaps you can.
MONITOR: This is the machine code of the section that contains the error. I must check the external registers. Read it to me as we go. It is a copy of an Earth machine, so I'm afraid we have to make do with their clumsy symbols.
ADRIC: The Doctor taught me to read Earth numbering.
TEGAN: Where are you off to? There's work to be done.
ADRIC: We're doing it.
ADRIC: A zero. Zero A. Four A. Nine two. Two C.
ADRIC: A zero. Three zero.
MONITOR: I'm sorry, I thought we had found something. It's somewhere in the subroutine. Somewhere.
ADRIC: Monitor, I still don't see why you need all these people. Why can't it all be done on machinery?
MONITOR: For many uses machinery is unsurpassed, but Logopolis is not interested in such uses. Block transfer computation cannot be done with computers.
ADRIC: Why not?
MONITOR: Our manipulation of numbers directly changes the physical world. There is no other mathematics like ours.
ADRIC: You mean the computations themselves would affect a computer?
MONITOR: Of course. Change its nature, cause it to malfunction. Only the living brain is immune.
ADRIC: But you had a computer out there. You were using it.
MONITOR: To record the code, yes. To prepare new algorithms, yes. But we must not use it to run our programme. Now, we had reached zero four, zero seven, A zero, three zero, three eight. There are no errors in the registers. We must search the streets.
NYSSA: Sonic projectors.
TEGAN: What are they for?
NYSSA: They must be creating a temporary zone of stasis around the Tardis, but I don't really understand their science.
TEGAN: That goes double for me.
ADRIC: Fourth block begins. A three. F eight.
MONITOR: E eight.
ADRIC: Sorry. E eight.
MONITOR: It is difficult, I know, but accuracy is of a vital importance.
ADRIC: Three three.
TEGAN: You can tell they're exploited.
NYSSA: These people are scientists.
TEGAN: So?
NYSSA: I've seen that look of dedication on my father's face.
TEGAN: Well, it doesn't seem to be doing any good, does it.
NYSSA: At least the dimensions are stabilised.
ADRIC: Eight nine. Nine A. E seven.
MONITOR: E nine.
ADRIC: Sorry. E nine. Two three. Wait! Wait. Did you say E nine? Look, it says E seven there.
MONITOR: You're right. And the next three numbers are wrong. This way.
TEGAN: The Tardis isn't much use to anybody that size, stable or not.
NYSSA: It gives us time.
TEGAN: Time to do what? We don't even know if he's alive in there.
DOCTOR: They've arrested the dimension spiral. Things are looking up.
MONITOR: This is the street. The error should be somewhere here.
MONITOR: Sabotage.
ADRIC: Murder.
MONITOR: Interfering with the working of Logopolis. The most dangerous crime in the universe.
DOCTOR: An error in the dimension subroutine. Somewhere here. I will not be beaten. I simply will not be beaten. But I could certainly do with a little more help from outside.
MONITOR: We must return to the Central Register, quickly.
ADRIC: The Monitor's done it. He's found the error.
MONITOR: The Doctor must reprogram block four of the dimensioning routine.
ADRIC: Those numbers are the ones that have to be changed.
TEGAN: If I show this to him, will he know what to do?
ADRIC: Yes.
TEGAN: Leave it to me.
NYSSA: Adric?
ADRIC: The Master's out here somewhere.
NYSSA: I came here to find the Master.
ADRIC: No.
NYSSA: I must know what's happened to my father.
ADRIC: This could be very dangerous.
NYSSA: I'm coming with you.
DOCTOR: The cheeseboard is the world, and the pieces the phenomena of the universe, as my old friend Huxley used to say. Cheese board? Chess board. And the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes nor makes the smallest concession to ignorance.
DOCTOR: I'm an ignorant old Doctor, and I've made a mistake. There's only one direction help can come from now. I'll just have to sit here and wait.
DOCTOR: Ah yes! Something along those lines.
ADRIC: The mark of the Master.
NYSSA: He must have added his own voice to the numbers and corrupted the Doctor's code.
ADRIC: And he's still here, somewhere. I saw him. He's been following us.
NYSSA: The Master?
ADRIC: I think so.
ADRIC: Come on.
TEGAN: I hope he's seen it.
MONITOR: I'm sure he has. And with those figures, he will be able to restore the Tardis. It won't take long.
TEGAN: Well, while he's sorting that out, perhaps you wouldn't mind explaining something to me.
TEGAN: Back home in Brisbane, we call that a sweatshop.
ADRIC: This street.
MASTER : Nyssa. Nyssa. Nyssa.
MASTER : Nyssa, my dear.
NYSSA: Father.
TEGAN: They don't smile, they don't talk to anybody.
MONITOR: Their language is the language of numbers. And they have no need to smile.
TEGAN: No need to smile?
MONITOR: We are a people driven not by individual need but by mathematical necessity. The language of the numbers is as much as we need. Now, it is important that we do not disturb them.
TEGAN: But if they don't talk to each other. You've done it!
MONITOR: Yes, there does seem to be some positive development.
NYSSA: But what is this mission of yours, father? You're so changed by it. You look younger, but so cold.
MASTER: Logopolis is a cold place. A cold, high place overlooking the universe. It holds a single great secret, Nyssa, which you and I must discover together.
NYSSA: And the Doctor. The Doctor can help us.
MASTER: Oh yes, the Doctor can certainly help us. You must return to him.
NYSSA: Father, I don't want to be parted from you.
MASTER: No need to, my dear. Here, wear this.
MASTER: It will keep us in mind of one another. Remember to tell no one that you've seen me, yet.
DOCTOR: Monitor?
MONITOR: My dear Doctor.
DOCTOR: I can't thank you enough.
MONITOR: There is no need.
DOCTOR: You too, Tegan. You too. Where are the others?
TEGAN: Adric and Nyssa went to look for the Master.
DOCTOR: What? They should know better than that. There've been enough unnecessary deaths as it is.
TEGAN: What deaths?
MONITOR: The murder of innocent Logopolitans.
DOCTOR: And the murder of innocent Earth people.
TEGAN: Earth people?
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEGAN: Aunty Vanessa?
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm so sorry, Tegan. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: The Master's already at work on Logopolis. I'm going to stop him if it's the last thing I do.
ADRIC: Nyssa!
NYSSA: Did you find him?
ADRIC: No. We'd better go back to the Doctor.
NYSSA: Ow!
ADRIC: Where did you get that?
NYSSA: It's too small for me.
ADRIC: What is it?
NYSSA: It's a present. I've been trying to get it off.
ADRIC: Who from?
NYSSA: I hope you haven't broken it.
ADRIC: Nyssa?
DOCTOR: Adric, Nyssa. Come on.
ADRIC + NYSSA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: I don't want you two chasing after the Master independently. You, Adric, should know how dangerous he is.
NYSSA: That's the man who brought me from Traken.
DOCTOR: Yes.
NYSSA: He said he was a friend of yours.
ADRIC: But he's the man on the bridge.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: You said to be prepared for the worst.
DOCTOR: Indeed I did, and I am prepared for the worst.
ADRIC: Why are you prepared for the worst, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Because he's here.
MASTER: Please remain where you are. I have it in my power to bring Logopolis to a complete halt.
DOCTOR: There's much more to this block transfer computation than we thought.
ADRIC: Yes, that's how they built a replica of the Pharos Project.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, but why? Why build a replica of the Pharos Project? Central Register.
NYSSA: Listen.
ADRIC: I don't
NYSSA: Shush.
ADRIC:  I can't hear anything.
DOCTOR: Quite.
NYSSA: Logopolis has stopped.
DOCTOR: And I was vain enough to think it was me he was after. Logopolis is his target.
MONITOR: Turn that machine off. You have no idea what you're doing.
MASTER: Merely emitting a sound-cancelling wave, Monitor. Logopolis is now temporarily suspended. The silence gives us an opportunity to discuss its future.
MONITOR: There will be no future. You are eroding structure, generating entropy.
MASTER: An absurd assertion. I know the power of this device down to the last decibel.
MONITOR: But you do not know Logopolis!
MASTER: But I shall, shan't I, when you've told me of the secret work you're doing here.
MONITOR: I cannot tell you.
MASTER: Why have you created a copy of the Pharos Project? Hmm. The time has come for you to share your secret with me.
MONITOR: No! No one must know. That has been our firm decision.
MASTER: Very well, we'll wait until you change it. Patience is a particular virtue of mine.
NYSSA: Father!
DOCTOR: That's not your father. Tremas is dead, murdered by him, the Master.
MASTER: Nyssa.
NYSSA: You killed my father?
MASTER: But his body remains useful. Without it I could not have conquered Logopolis.
DOCTOR: This is not conquest, it's devastation.
MASTER: It's nothing more than a blanket of silence.
DOCTOR: Which is killing the Logopolitans and turning them to dust.
MASTER: You expect me to believe that?
DOCTOR: Yes!
MONITOR: You're destroying everything. It may already be too late.
MASTER: You exaggerate, Monitor. Logopolis is not the universe.
MONITOR: But it is! Logopolis is the keystone. If you destroy Logopolis, you unravel the whole causal nexus.
MASTER: Causal nexus? You insult my intelligence.
DOCTOR: You're interfering with the law of cause and effect.
ADRIC: Nyssa! Nyssa, let go.
MASTER: That is a demonstration of the causal nexus.
TEGAN: You revolting man!
MASTER: The electro-muscular constrictor gives me complete control over that hand. Please replace the screen.
TEGAN: I wouldn't take orders from you if you were the last man in the universe.
MASTER: Very well, one of your young friends will eliminate the other.
DOCTOR: Don't you understand? Logopolis is crucial to the whole of creation. This could mean the end of the universe.
MASTER: I've never been persuaded by hyperbole, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Then come into the streets and see what's happening.
MASTER: No need for that. I can demonstrate the continued functioning of Logopolis from here. This device only creates temporary silence and can be switched off.
MONITOR: You will hear nothing. Local disruption of structure is now irreversible. Logopolis is dead.
MASTER: They've done this deliberately. You've done this deliberately to deprive me of my prize!
MONITOR: Nothing is solid now. Entropy has taken over.
TEGAN: What's he done?
ADRIC: Everything began to waste away when he interfered. But why?
DOCTOR: The numbers were supporting the whole system.
MASTER: I don't believe it. My biomechanism's untouched.
MONITOR: The degradation is random.
MASTER: No, Monitor. This is some crude defence mechanism. A device to delude me. Come, Nyssa.
NYSSA: No. No.
MASTER: I will wring the truth out of it.
DOCTOR: The entropy you released is eroding your systems, too.
MASTER: Entropy? Absurd. The power is weak. Some freak interference. Increase the power.
MONITOR: More power would simply speed the collapse.
DOCTOR: Don't.
MONITOR: From this point, the unravelling will spread out until the whole universe is reduced to nothing.
MASTER: So it's true.
MONITOR: Yes, Doctor, you were right. Our numbers were holding the fabric of the universe together.
NYSSA: But how? Surely in a closed system like the universe, entropy is bound to increase?
MONITOR: Certainly. The universe long ago passed the point of total collapse.
DOCTOR: Passed the point?
MONITOR: If it had remained closed. But we have the means to postpone the time.
MASTER: So that's why you adapted the Pharos Project.
MONITOR: Yes. We opened the system by creating voids into other universes.
ADRIC: The Charged Vacuum Emboitments!
DOCTOR: We passed through one of your voids, Monitor.
MONITOR: It all depended on our continued endeavours. A temporary solution while the advanced research unit worked on a more permanent plan. But nothing will come of that now. Our labours wasted. The voids will be closing.
TEGAN: There must be something we can do?
TEGAN: This'll teach you to meddle in things you don't understand.
MONITOR: We are beyond recriminations now. Beyond everything.
DOCTOR: Not quite.
DOCTOR: We must pool our resources.
NYSSA: The creature that killed my father
DOCTOR: I can't choose the company I keep!
MASTER: An alliance with you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: In the circumstances, yes.
MASTER: If we do cooperate, there'll be no question of you ever returning to Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: If we don't cooperate, there'll be no question of Gallifrey.
TEGAN: Doctor, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Please. Shush. As Time Lords, you and I have special responsibilities.
MASTER: Together, then.
NYSSA: But Doctor!
DOCTOR: I've never chosen my own company. Nyssa, it was you who contacted me and begged me to help you find your father. Tegan, it's your own curiosity that got you into this. And Adric, a stowaway.
TEGAN: The Tardis!
NYSSA: It's followed us from the Central Register.
ADRIC: But how can it get here when there's no one in it?
DOCTOR: Did I say there was no one in it?
NYSSA: It must be the man who brought be to Logopolis.
DOCTOR: I don't want any further argument. One, two, three of you into the Tardis, quickly. Go on.
ADRIC: Look, we want to help you.
DOCTOR: It's impossible. My friend in there will look after you. I'm collaborating with the Master. Now go on. Battle stations.
NYSSA: The man's a murderer!
ADRIC: Come on, Nyssa. He means it.
MASTER: Together?
DOCTOR: One last hope.
Part Four
DOCTOR: Monitor? He's gone.
MASTER: You do realise he's no chance of survival without our help?
DOCTOR: The Monitor wouldn't abandon us.
MASTER: He's trying to salvage the research team's work. He must have gone to the Central Register, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, maybe. It was the last addition to Logopolis. It might be the last one to survive. We need his knowledge. Come on.
ADRIC: We all want to help the Doctor, but we've got to do as he says.
TEGAN: Listen. The Doctor's my ticket back to London Airport, so I'm going after him.
ADRIC: Tegan!
TEGAN: Have a nice trip.
DOCTOR: The rot is spilling outwards into the universe from this point after eons of constraint. Come on. Let's collect the Monitor and get out.
MASTER: In my Tardis?
DOCTOR: There's no other way.
MASTER: You're assuming a lot, aren't you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, aren't I.
DOCTOR: Monitor?
MASTER: Logopolitan maths on a computer?
DOCTOR: Monitor, the stability of
MONITOR: This is the programme we were developing to take the burden from our own shoulders. A series of data statements to keep the Charged Vacuum Emboitments open of their own accord.
DOCTOR: What, do you mean the advanced research project?
MONITOR: The computer holds a complete log of the research.
MASTER: Then the answer's here.
MONITOR: Take care. The research is far from complete.
DOCTOR: Monitor, were you on the right track? You must tell us about the project in every detail.
MONITOR: There is nothing to tell. It's all there for you to read. Now, I must get on with my work.
TEGAN: Doctor! Doctor!
MONITOR: I've done what I can, with the Registry in ruins. We must now realign the aerial, beam the programme out to space. There is a CVE close by we might still be able to re-open.
TEGAN: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEGAN: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tegan, I told you to get out of here.
TEGAN: No thanks, Doctor. I'm staying with you. You're the only insurance policy I've got.
DOCTOR: As safe as houses, eh?
MASTER: Doctor, we must form a plan. I propose one, we withdraw to a position of temporary security. Two, we reconfigure our two Tardises into time cone inverters. Three, we create a stable safe zone by applying temporal inversion isometry to as much of space-time as we can isolate.
TEGAN: Look!
MASTER: Horrible.
TEGAN: Hardly more horrible than shrinking people.
MASTER: No. Do what you like, Doctor. Logopolis is yours.
TEGAN: Doctor, stop him. He's getting away.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, listen. Reconfigure the two Tardises into time cone inverters? It would work. What a brilliant mind.
TEGAN: And what a waste of two more brilliant minds if we don't do something soon.
DOCTOR: The Monitor's programme. You can help me.
TEGAN: I can?
DOCTOR: Yes. I want this in pieces.
DOCTOR: As I thought.
TEGAN: What?
DOCTOR: Bubble memory.
TEGAN: Bubble memory.
DOCTOR: Yes. You realise what this means?
TEGAN: No, as a matter of fact I don't, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Bubble memory is non-volatile. Remove the power and the bit patterns are still retained in tiny magnetic domains in these chips. The research team's final project is still here.
TEGAN: Which would be great if we had a computer to run it on.
DOCTOR: I've an idea where we could find one. On Earth.
TEGAN: Earth.
TEGAN: Earth?
DOCTOR: Yes. The Master's Tardis. Come on.
ADRIC: He's unsetting the coordinates. He's disconnecting the entire coordinate subsystem. But he can't do that. No!
NYSSA: What's the matter?
ADRIC: Down!
NYSSA: What's happening?
ADRIC: We're being taken right out of time and space.
DOCTOR: One good lift deserves another, don't you think?
MASTER: I'm very grateful.
DOCTOR: Earth, please.
ADRIC: We're hovering.
NYSSA: Outside space and time.
ADRIC: But the Tardis isn't supposed to do that.
NYSSA: We seem to be safe.
ADRIC: Safe. Yes. The Doctor told the Watcher to look after us.
NYSSA: I'd rather be with the Doctor.
MASTER: The Pharos computer room.
DOCTOR: Yes. I envy you your Tardis, Master.
MASTER: Excellent, Doctor. Envy is the beginning of all true greatness.
DOCTOR: Shush.
DOCTOR: No!
MASTER: It's the lightspeed overdrive, Doctor. You'll need that to accelerate the signal from the transmitter.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry. I thought you meant to shoot him.
MASTER: Oh, Doctor. You can explain.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: Ahem. Good morning. Good evening.
DOCTOR: He's unconscious.
MASTER: Never mind. I feel we've been spared a very difficult conversation.
ADRIC: When all this began, the Doctor wanted to reconfigure the Tardis so it'd work like the Master's.
NYSSA: What's wrong with it?
ADRIC: It's getting old.
NYSSA: Entropy again. You can't get away from it.
ADRIC: He wants to talk to us.
NYSSA: To you.
MASTER: What makes you think this programme of the Monitor's is going to work, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. It's a sort of vague faith in the nature of things, I suppose.
MASTER: It's in the very nature of things for entropy to win.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it's the age-old battle, isn't it? Entropy versus structure. Still, while there's life there's six of one and half a dozen of the other.
MASTER: Woolly thinking, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, but very comforting when worn next to the skin.
NYSSA: Well, what did he want? What did he say to you?
ADRIC: It's as if he knows what's going to happen.
NYSSA: But what did he say to you, Adric?
ADRIC: Come on, we've got work to do.
NYSSA: But where are we going?
ADRIC: The Pharos Project on Earth. Now, I've got to set the exact coordinates. Earth is in sector eighty twenty three of the third quadrant. The temporal settings are laid in on this panel. It always looks so easy when the Doctor does it.
NYSSA: Adric, the scanner. Adric.
ADRIC: The whole universe. Of course. We're beyond space and time.
NYSSA: That must be the entropy field. Where's the Earth?
ADRIC: I can't see it.
NYSSA: It's there.
ADRIC: Earth's galaxy has a few more hours left.
NYSSA: Adric, I can't see Traken.
ADRIC: Traken should be
NYSSA: I can't even see Metulla Orionsis. The Master killed my stepmother, and then my father, and now the world that I grew up in, blotted out forever.
TEGAN: The dawn's coming up. There are security guards outside.
DOCTOR: Any good?
MASTER: It's still not running. The programme's useless. It's time to abandon this line of reasoning.
DOCTOR: Of course. The programme's not being fed into the core.
MASTER: Well?
DOCTOR: We start again.
ADRIC: Right, hold on. We're going back.
ADRIC: Now!
NYSSA: Just like Logopolis.
ADRIC: The Earth people use it to beam messages to the stars. The Doctor calls it reiterated invitation to alien intelligences in deep space.
NYSSA: And that's us.
ADRIC: So they'll be very pleased to see us.
DOCTOR: It's running.
MASTER: If you call this alien gibberish a programme.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to wait until the data reaches the CVE.
MASTER: First we must reach the transmitter and connect up the light speed overdrive.
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEGAN: What about the guards?
DOCTOR: I suggest we use your Tardis.
MASTER: Impossible. The light speed overdrive's disconnected.
DOCTOR: We've still got to get across to the antenna control room.
MASTER: I agree.
TEGAN: I agree too, for what it's worth.
DOCTOR: Good.
GUARD: Intruders! After them!
MASTER: Sentimental fool. Thanks to you, we're now weaponless.
ADRIC: Nyssa and I have heard your message across the universe and have come to answer your call.
GUARD: Message? What? Now who are you?
NYSSA: We are the alien beings who
TEGAN: Listen. Here, you fellows, you've got this all topsy turvy.
MASTER: From here, Charged Vacuum Emboitment is in line with the constellation Cassiopeia.
DOCTOR: Three C four six one.
MASTER: I decided to use my Tardis after all. Three C four six one. Three zero four four.
MASTER: You see, Doctor, I overlook nothing.
DOCTOR: You overlooked the light speed overdrive.
MASTER: I gave you this to demonstrate my trust.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
DOCTOR: What?
MASTER: But I don't take foolish risks. The real light speed overdrive is here.
DOCTOR: What? And powered up, I see.
MASTER: We have only to connect this cable from the computer room and the job is done. The aerial's now aligned to the CVE. As you devised the plan, I think the honour should be yours, Doctor.
MASTER: Peoples of the universe, please attend carefully. The message that follows is vital to the future of you all.
MASTER: Well?
DOCTOR: The data's reached the CVE. It's stabilising.
MASTER: So it works. Congratulations, Doctor. I always knew you'd do it.
DOCTOR: You did most of this.
MASTER: Oh, no. I was little more than a humble assistant, but I have learned a great deal. And now I think it's time for you to go and explain the presence of your friends. There's quite a hubbub outside.
DOCTOR: You're quite right. One mistake now could ruin everything.
MASTER: I know that, Doctor, and it could happen so easily.
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
MASTER: The universe is hanging on a thread. A single recursive pulse down that cable and the CVE would close forever. Even a humble assistant could do it.
DOCTOR: You're mad!
MASTER : Peoples of the universe, please attend carefully. The message that follows is vital to the future of you all. The choice for you all is simple. A continued existence under my guidance, or total annihilation. At the time of speaking, the
DOCTOR: Blackmail.
MASTER: No, Doctor, I'm merely reporting the state of affairs. I have it in my power now to save them or destroy them.
DOCTOR: You're utterly mad.
MASTER: Back, Doctor. The proceedings must not be interrupted. It's mine. The CVE. It's all mine.
DOCTOR: Only while that cable holds.
MASTER:  Predictable as ever, Doctor.
DALEK: Doctor.
CAPTAIN:  Doctor.
CYBERMAN: Doctor.
DAVROS: Doctor.
SONTARAN: Doctor.
ZYGON: Doctor.
BLACK GUARDIAN: Doctor, you shall die for this!

ADRIC: The Watcher.
NYSSA: He was the Doctor all the time.
