The Visitation
Part One
ELIZABETH: Papa!
ELIZABETH: Papa! Papa!
SQUIRE: Oh! What's all the noise Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH: Have you seen the sky? It's beautiful.
SQUIRE: What're you talking about?
ELIZABETH: The whole sky is ablaze.
ELIZABETH: Oh! They've gone.
SQUIRE: What have gone?
ELIZABETH: The lights.
SQUIRE: What sort of lights were they?
ELIZABETH: Like a hundred shooting stars. I wish you'd seen them.
SQUIRE: I don't like the sound of it.
ELIZABETH: Papa.
SQUIRE: Strange lights in the sky never bode well for the future.
ELIZABETH: You're so old-fashioned.
SQUIRE: Yes.
SQUIRE: Ralph! Bring a log!
RALPH  Yes, sir!
SQUIRE: I feel a chill.
ELIZABETH: You can't, Papa. It's a perfectly warm evening.
CHARLES: Father always feels a chill when he's losing. It's either that or his gout bothers him.
SQUIRE: Arrant nonsense!
SQUIRE: I feel a definite chill about me shoulders.
SQUIRE: There you are, you see. Have you left the door open?
RALPH: Me, sir? No. Would you like me to fetch your shawl?
SQUIRE: No. Er, no, I think I'd prefer a warmer. I'll have me posset now.
RALPH: Yes, sir.
CHARLES: You're incorrigible, Father. Haven't you drunk enough already?
SQUIRE: This is medicinal.
CHARLES: I'm going to bed. Goodnight, Father.
RALPH: Are you sure you're not having a posset, Master Charles?
CHARLES: No, thank you.
RALPH: In that case I'll bid you good night, sir.
CHARLES: Good night, Ralph.
SQUIRE: Oh! It's you, sir. What the Hades is going on?
CHARLES: There's someone down there with a gun the likes I've never seen before.
SQUIRE: Ralph. Where's Ralph?
CHARLES: I fear he's hit.
SQUIRE: Fire and brimstone!
SQUIRE: God protect us!
SQUIRE: What was that?
CHARLES: I don't know!
ELIZABETH: Papa! What's happening, Papa?
CHARLES: Take this.
SQUIRE: Would it be too obvious to say, we are under attack?
ELIZABETH: But from whom?
SQUIRE: From whatever that is.
CHARLES: Our shots stopped its comrade on the stairs.
SQUIRE: But this one's in armour.
CHARLES: Which at this range is useless. Come on, Father, now!
DOCTOR: How many times have I told you, Adric, not to interfere with, with things that you don't understand.
ADRIC: I was trying to escape.
DOCTOR: In the TSS? You were lucky you didn't destroy the whole Kinda tribe.
ADRIC: I didn't realise it would be that difficult to control.
DOCTOR: That isn't the point. You should never have got into that unit.
ADRIC: Well, as it turned out no one was hurt.
DOCTOR: Apart from Aris.
ADRIC: A flesh wound.
DOCTOR: Try to understand, Adric, because you get away with something, it doesn't justify it.
ADRIC: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Next time you want to escape from somewhere, walk.
NYSSA: Poor old Adric. Always in trouble.
ADRIC: And I try so hard.
DOCTOR: Is Tegan ready?
NYSSA: I'll check.
ADRIC: What's that?
DOCTOR: A fault.
ADRIC: Serious?
DOCTOR: Must be the lateral balance cones again. You know, I must do some maintenance after we've delivered Tegan.
ADRIC: It's going to seem strange without her, though I must admit I'm not entirely convinced that she likes me.
DOCTOR: Now, don't jump to conclusions, Adric. Sometimes we humanoids try to disguise our, our true feelings. Well, don't just stand there, Adric, help me.
NYSSA: What's the matter?
TEGAN: It's only sunk in properly, what happened to me on Deva Loka.
NYSSA: What? The Doctor said nothing eventful had occurred.
TEGAN: He would. But while you were enjoying forty eight hours peaceful sleep in the delta wave augmenter, my mind was occupied. Taken over.
NYSSA: By whom?
TEGAN: More a what. Something called a Mara. It makes me shiver to think of it.
NYSSA: You weren't hurt?
TEGAN: No. No, but that's not the point. It's unnerved me.
NYSSA: You'll soon be on Earth with all this unpleasantness forgotten.
TEGAN: Can't wait.
NYSSA: At leas, you won't have any awkward questions to answer about where you've been.
TEGAN: So the Doctor says. I don't understand how.
NYSSA: Just accept what he says.
NYSSA: You'll arrive back at the airport exactly on time for your flight, half an hour after you entered the Tardis.
TEGAN: Some half hour. Now I have to pretend that nothing's happened in the mean time.
NYSSA: You'll soon settle down.
TEGAN: I hope so. Nyssa, I know I haven't always been the best of companions. I'll miss you. All of you.
DOCTOR: Earth, Heathrow, 1981.
ADRIC: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not one of the most stimulating places in the universe, but nevertheless, where requested to be.
ADRIC: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
TEGAN: Is that supposed to be Heathrow?
ADRIC: It is.
TEGAN: Well, they've certainly let the grass grow since I was last there.
ADRIC: Well, actually, they haven't built the airport yet. We're about three hundred years early.
TEGAN: That's great. Perhaps I can go out, file a claim on the land. When they get round to inventing the aircraft, I'll make a fortune.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, a small error has been made.
TEGAN: You call three hundred years a small error?
DOCTOR: It's probably due to nothing more than a temperamental solenoid on the lateral balance cones.
TEGAN: Why do you always have some incomprehensible answer?
DOCTOR: And, as you know, the Tardis isn't always
DOCTOR: Er, reliable.
TEGAN: Call yourself a Time Lord? A broken clock keeps better time than you do. At least it's accurate twice a day, which is more than you ever are.
DOCTOR: Why does she always overreact?
NYSSA: I think she's finding the idea of going more painful than she thought.
DOCTOR: Then why didn't she say so, rather than fly off the handle like that.
NYSSA: That's Tegan.
ADRIC: Perhaps you'd better talk to her.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Too much has been said already. Earthlings.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry. I realise how disappointed you must be.
TEGAN: I'm sorry, too, but you did make a promise.
DOCTOR: And I'll keep it. Consider this a fortuitous mistake. It isn't everyone who gets the chance to wander round their own history.
TEGAN: I'm not sure I want to. This place stinks.
DOCTOR: What? I suppose it does a bit.
ADRIC: Look, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Sulphur.
ADRIC: Some sort of volcanic action?
DOCTOR: Wrong time and place for that.
TEGAN: Are you sure this is Earth?
DOCTOR: Undoubtedly. When we find the person who's burning the sulphur, perhaps you'll believe him.
VILLAGER: Four strangers coming this way.
NYSSA: Is it sensible to go on?
DOCTOR: Probably not.
TEGAN: I've lost my bearings already.
DOCTOR: There's potassium nitrate in with the sulphur.
TEGAN: Oh, that's great.
ADRIC: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: Potassium nitrate and sulphur are constituents of a primitive explosive. Gunpowder.
TEGAN: I don't like this place.
NYSSA: Doctor!
TEGAN: Shouldn't we get back to the Tardis?
DOCTOR: This time I agree.
DOCTOR: Ah! Good morning.
DOCTOR: Come on, back to the Tardis.
VILLAGER: You all right? Don't worry, we'll get them.
NYSSA: Now which way?
ADRIC: I don't know.
NYSSA: Use your homing devise.
ADRIC: I must have dropped it during the fight.
TEGAN: Oh, tremendous.
DOCTOR: Come on, come on. This way.
ADRIC: Ow!
NYSSA: Are you all right?
ADRIC: I don't know.
DOCTOR: There's nothing broken. Can you stand?
ADRIC: I'll try.
NYSSA: Lean on me.
ADRIC: I'll be all right in a minute.
TEGAN: We may not have a minute.
MACE: Can I be of any assistance?
DOCTOR: Can you help us?
MACE: I have a convenient refuge nearby.
TEGAN: How do we know we can trust him?
MACE: You have little choice. You either trust me or give yourselves up to your pursuers, who would probably cudgel you to death.
MACE: I don't think they will bother us again. If the lad can walk, my camp is this way.
DOCTOR: Lead on, sir.
VILLAGER: Go back to the village for help. We'll follow them.
TEGAN: This is home?
MACE: For the last night or two. Fortune has made me itinerant.
DOCTOR: Why were those men following us?
MACE: You don't know?
DOCTOR: Well, we're new to the area.
MACE: You must be new to the world, sir. Have not you heard there is plague?
TEGAN: Where?
MACE: Everywhere. That is why the village is guarded so vigilantly. They're terrified of strangers and the pestilence they may carry.
DOCTOR: Of course. The reason for the sulphuric smoke. Purification fires.
NYSSA: Is that why you're not staying in the village?
MACE: Alas, because of the plague, everywhere is unfriendly.
DOCTOR: Hence the guns.
MACE: No, not entirely. I was once a noted thespian until forced into rural exile by the closure of the theatres. It is only with the aid of these properties I am able to command the attention of an audience nowadays.
TEGAN: You sound like a highwayman or a robber.
MACE: A gentleman of the road, madam. Richard Mace at your service.
MACE: Though I only plan to rob you of a little of your time and company. After many weeks alone in the woods, I would risk anything for an hour's good conversation.
MACE: Yes.
DOCTOR: How bad is the plague?
MACE: Oh, the worst I've ever seen. More virulent here than in the city, but that's only to be expected.
DOCTOR: Why?
MACE: Did you not see the comet a few weeks ago? A portent of doom, if ever I saw one. Its aurora barely faded from the sky before the first local case was reported.
ADRIC: You were clear until then?
MACE: Oh, completely.
DOCTOR: They're not due for a comet for years.
MACE: It lit up the sky as I've never experienced it before.
NYSSA: Are you sure it wasn't a meteor?
MACE: Call it what you wish. I have seen many falling stars, but this was without parallel.
DOCTOR: Interesting, and so is the ornament around your neck.
TEGAN: Doctor, don't you think we should be getting back to the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Yes. Not yet. May I see?
MACE: Oh, surely. I found it in the loft last night.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Interesting piece of work. What do you think?
NYSSA: It's made from polygrite, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes.
NYSSA: From such a primitive society?
DOCTOR: Do you mind if I have a look around your loft?
MACE: As you wish, sir.
DOCTOR: Fit for a climb, Adric?
TEGAN: Doctor, he should rest.
ADRIC: Don't worry, Tegan. We Alzarians are different from you. We recover faster.
NYSSA: Is there anything I can do?
DOCTOR : Oh, have a look round down there.
TEGAN: What exactly are we looking for?
ADRIC: What is it he's wearing?
DOCTOR: Part of an alien bracelet made for a very special purpose.
ADRIC: How could it have got here?
DOCTOR: Oh, make your own guess. A comet when there shouldn't have been a comet, a meteor that doesn't look like a meteor. Whatever the phenomenon was, it certainly wasn't natural.
ADRIC: Some sort of a spacecraft landing?
DOCTOR: Or burning up in the atmosphere.
ADRIC: But surely, for the bracelet to be here some of the crew must have survived?
DOCTOR: Ah, not necessarily. The bracelet is strong enough to have survived the crash. However, if we find something more fragile.
ADRIC: Then there are survivors.
DOCTOR: Correct.
NYSSA: Doctor! Power packs!
DOCTOR: Well done!
DOCTOR: Tell me, who owns this barn?
MACE: I will show you.
VILLAGER: Now what are they up to?
MACE: Surely you must be aware, sir, that there is a certain protocol to be observed when approaching the gentry.
DOCTOR: Of course. I've met kings, emperors, megalomaniacs in my time.
MACE: Ah, then you must know, sir, that the nobility will not take kindly to being knocked up and questioned about the contents of their barns. It's a sure way of us all being horse-whipped. And I have a particularly sensitive skin, sir.
NYSSA: Is the man blind?
ADRIC: He nearly killed us.
MACE: The miller. A man of very sour disposition.
TEGAN: And not much road sense.
MACE: Shouldn't we use the tradesman's entrance?
DOCTOR: I'm calling on the master of the house, not his servants.
MACE: Please, sir, knock with a little more humility.
DOCTOR: You knock while I look around.
TEGAN: Can we come with you?
DOCTOR: Just Nyssa. If anyone opens the door, call me.
DOCTOR: No one at home.
NYSSA: Then who was the miller visiting?
DOCTOR: Perhaps we should find out. That window doesn't look fastened properly.
MACE: What do we say if the door is opened?
ADRIC: Hello?
DOCTOR: What a very pleasant room.
NYSSA: Shall I let the others in?
DOCTOR: No, not yet. Let's see who's at home first. Hello?
NYSSA: Why are you so certain the aliens have come here?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not. For all I know they went to the village.
NYSSA: They could also have died from the plague.
DOCTOR: Indeed. So, the sooner we find out, the sooner we can return Tegan to her own time. Anyone at home?
NYSSA: Have you any idea who the aliens might be?
DOCTOR: No, not really. Polygrite is found in many parts of the universe. So are power packs.
NYSSA: Why are you so concerned about them? They might be friendly.
DOCTOR: Well, if I'm right, the comet that actor saw was their ship burning up in the atmosphere. They're probably stranded here, desperate. They could wreak havoc.
NYSSA: So, what are you going to do if you find them?
DOCTOR: Oh, twist their arms a bit to let me take them back to their own planet.
NYSSA: I hope they have arms to twist.
DOCTOR: I'll find something.
DOCTOR: There are weapons missing.
NYSSA: What's that?
DOCTOR: Gunpowder. Someone's been careless.
NYSSA: Look, a power pack.
DOCTOR: So they have been here.
NYSSA: I think we should go, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're beginning to sound like Tegan.
NYSSA: I begin to understand how she feels.
DOCTOR: Oh.
NYSSA: What?
DOCTOR: Look.
NYSSA: Scarring from a high energy beam.
DOCTOR: And fired from a weapon.
NYSSA: So much for my friendly aliens.
DOCTOR: Hold this.
DOCTOR: There.
DOCTOR: Let's give them the benefit of the doubt, assume it was an accident.
DOCTOR: But this isn't.
NYSSA: Now what?
DOCTOR: Well, you only build a staircase to lead somewhere.
NYSSA: As a rule.
DOCTOR: Why should anyone want to build a wall here?
NYSSA: Does it matter?
DOCTOR: Well, this should be a very important staircase. Logically it should lead from the main hall to the kitchens.
NYSSA: Perhaps there's another way.
DOCTOR: No. There's something wrong. I can feel it.
TEGAN: At last.
TEGAN: How did you get in?
NYSSA: We found an open window.
MACE: You broke in?
NYSSA: It's perfectly safe. There isn't anyone here.
MACE: Are you sure?
NYSSA: Come in and look.
ADRIC: Where's the Doctor?
NYSSA: Downstairs. He's found a wall that seems to fascinate him.
TEGAN: Is there anyone else here?
NYSSA: Not that we've found.
TEGAN: I don't like this house. I think it's a bit spooky.
MACE: I find this house full of style and quality.
NYSSA: We should join the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ah.
ADRIC: Any sign of survivors?
NYSSA: They've been here. We found yet another power pack.
ADRIC: I wonder what they use those things for?
TEGAN: I'll bet it isn't transistor radios.
MACE: What are these words you are using?
NYSSA: The Doctor will explain.
TEGAN: Come on.
ADRIC: Where's he gone?
NYSSA: Doctor?
NYSSA: Doctor! 
TEGAN: Doctor!
Part Two
DOCTOR: Yes?
NYSSA: Oh, thank heavens.
MACE: What an incredible illusion.
DOCTOR: It is, isn't it.
TEGAN: How do you do that?
DOCTOR: Very simple. I found the door.
TEGAN: I don't see it.
DOCTOR: It's there all the same. I knew there was something peculiar about this wall.
NYSSA: Is it an energy barrier?
DOCTOR: Right! I picked the lock.
ADRIC: But if the barrier's open, why can't we see through it?
DOCTOR: Camouflage. As you pass through it, it opens around you.
MACE: With a trick like that you could make a fortune around the fairgrounds.
DOCTOR: I must speak to the people who invented it.
NYSSA: Any survivors?
DOCTOR: Not yet.
MACE: An amazing illusion. I must learn how it's done.
ADRIC: What's that smell?
DOCTOR: Soliton gas.
NYSSA: I thought I recognised it.
TEGAN: Who'd want this sort of atmosphere? It's stifling.
DOCTOR: Well, someone who needs it to breathe properly. Let's find them.
DOCTOR: I said, let's find them.
MACE: Er, should you find the wine cellar, sir, a bottle of sack'd be most appreciated.
TEGAN: That's stealing.
MACE: I am a highwayman, madam.
TEGAN: This isn't a highway.
NYSSA: It's locked.
DOCTOR: So
DOCTOR: This must be it.
TEGAN: It's so gloomy.
DOCTOR: They're near.
TEGAN: How do you know?
NYSSA: The smell of soliton is much stronger.
MACE: Why do we lurk in this cellar when there is a whole house to loot?
DOCTOR: You said you wanted wine. Help yourself.
MACE: Ah! I'm so impetuous. Always looking to the hills and missing the treasure at my feet.
TEGAN: I wonder what those are for?
DOCTOR: Just don't disturb anything.
NYSSA: You recognise any characteristics?
DOCTOR: The regulator isn't pulsing properly.
TEGAN: Doctor, look.
DOCTOR: Oh. Well, perhaps they're just for research.
TEGAN: I feel itchy just looking at them.
ADRIC: What does that stuff taste like?
MACE: Nectar.
ADRIC: Oh. What does that taste like?
MACE: You stupid
DOCTOR: No, don't!
DOCTOR: Nyssa, get out of here.
NYSSA: What about Tegan?
DOCTOR: Just get out of here.
MACE: I can't find the gap.
NYSSA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Now, I don't know if you can understand me, but I would like to point out how volatile soliton is when mixed freely with oxygen.
DOCTOR: You fire that beam of yours, you'll turn this house into an inferno.
 
DOCTOR: Adric, can you move?
DOCTOR: Tegan!
DOCTOR: Adric, look after her. I'll be back.
NYSSA: We must wait for the Doctor!
MACE: Your Doctor is a dead man. You saw what was in the cellar. The great reaper, Death.
DOCTOR: That's what you're supposed to think.
MACE: Well, what was it then?
DOCTOR: An android. A mechanical man. A machine.
MACE: Android? Your brain is addled, sir. That was Death. You saw what effect my pistols had on him.
DOCTOR: Oh, it takes more than a pair of flintlocks to damage an android.
NYSSA: Is Tegan dead?
DOCTOR: No, but I don't know how badly hurt she is. Where are you going?
MACE: Away!
DOCTOR: I came up here to get you.
MACE: I would rather be sealed up in a plague house, sir, than stay here.
DOCTOR: Adric and Tegan are hurt. I need your help to get them out.
DOCTOR: You see this? This a part of a control bracelet. It's a device used on prison planets to control difficult prisoners. It isn't an ornament. And the thing you saw in the cellar comes from the same place as the bracelet.
MACE: How can that control anyone?
DOCTOR: Like this.
DOCTOR: If this was on your wrist, you'd have lost control of your mind by now.
MACE: Nonsense, sir. That glow is a conjuring trick. I'm a man of the theatre. I'm not impressed by trickery, however clever it is.
DOCTOR: Well.
DOCTOR: This is a trick you won't see done for many a day.
DOCTOR: That's what happens when you discharge a power pack.
MACE: How does this android, as you call him, come from another world? There are no other worlds. Any fool knows that.
DOCTOR: Why are Earth people so parochial?
LEADER: Who is this man?
TEGAN: Who said that?
LEADER: Answer my question!
ADRIC: The Doctor.
LEADER: And where is this Doctor from?
TEGAN: He's never told us. He likes to be mysterious, although he talks a lot about, er, Guildford. I think that's where he comes from.
LEADER: You are being a very stupid woman.
TEGAN: That isn't a very original observation.
LEADER: I know that he is not of this planet or time.
ADRIC: What rubbish.
LEADER: The Doctor has a sonic device which he used to dismantle the energy barrier. He also has an understanding of the gas known as soliton.
ADRIC: We don't know anything about that.
LEADER: You are wearing synthetic garments manufactured by technology as yet unknown on this planet.
TEGAN: You'll have to ask my tailor about that.
LEADER: I'm asking you! For the last time. Where are you from?
MACE: You are asking too much of me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on, Nyssa, let's go.
NYSSA: What about Adric and Tegan?
DOCTOR: Well, there's nothing we can do now until we've dealt with the android.
NYSSA: But how? We haven't any weapons.
DOCTOR: No. Well, er, we'll try modifying the sonic booster in the Tardis. If we connect it to a frequency accelerator
NYSSA: Yes?
DOCTOR: Well, we may just get a high enough pitch to vibrate the android to pieces.
NYSSA: Really. And how close do we have to get for it to have an effect?
DOCTOR: Very.
NYSSA: The android's armed. If it wanted, it could destroy us ten times over.
MACE: Once would be enough.
NYSSA: Doctor, you cannot afford to improvise against an armed android.
DOCTOR: I have no intention of doing so. Now, if you've quite finished lecturing me, I suggest we go back to the Tardis and get started.
DOCTOR: That way's locked. Good day!
LEADER: Now, tell me about your mode of transport.
ADRIC: The Tardis. A sort of time-space machine.
LEADER: And where is this Tardis now?
ADRIC: I don't know. In the woods somewhere. Only the Doctor knows exactly where.
LEADER: And you are both crew members of this ship?
TEGAN: That's right. Vital members. Kill us and you'll never get to ride in it.
LEADER: It seems that your companions have abandoned you. Perhaps you overrate your importance.
NYSSA: Where will you go?
MACE: As far away from that house as possible.
NYSSA: You won't reconsider helping us?
MACE: Madam, it shames me to tell you, but I, I will not go back inside that house.
DOCTOR: We're wasting time, Nyssa.
DOCTOR: If you see anyone wearing a bracelet like this, stay away from them.
MACE: Yes, I will, sir.
DOCTOR: Come on.
MACE: Doctor! Doctor! What is that?
LEADER: Activate the poacher and his friends. I want them to bring me the Doctor. Then get a group of villagers to search for the Tardis.
DOCTOR: No one here.
NYSSA: The place has been stripped.
DOCTOR: Most of the hardware is up at the house, I should think.
MACE: What is this structure?
DOCTOR: An escape pod. A sort of life boat, only from a ship that flies.
MACE: Flies?
DOCTOR: That's right.
MACE: But how are the dimensions greater within?
DOCTOR: Because it buried itself on impact.
MACE: And how is it lit?
DOCTOR: Vintaric crystals. Quite a common form of lighting.
MACE: I don't understand any of this.
NYSSA: This is all that's left of the craft that brought the android to Earth.
DOCTOR: The lights you saw in the sky a few weeks ago, were the main part of the ship burning up in the atmosphere.
MACE: I can't believe any of the things you are telling me.
NYSSA: It's true.
DOCTOR: The presence of the pod confirms it.
MACE: How do you know all these things?
DOCTOR: Ah. That would be rather difficult to explain.
NYSSA: You can trust us.
DOCTOR: Which is more than you can say for the owners of this ship.
TEGAN: Bleak, isn't it?
ADRIC: I'm a fool. I should never have told him about the Tardis.
TEGAN: Don't let it get you down. If you hadn't have told him, I would have. I don't think he was joking about torturing us.
ADRIC: We've got to get out of here.
TEGAN: Oh sure, but how?
DOCTOR: I wonder how many Terileptils this pod could carry?
NYSSA: And androids.
DOCTOR: Yes. Terileptils build those things too well.
NYSSA: Are you still sure the sonic booster can deal with it?
DOCTOR: It has to. The androids are programmed to protect. The only way around them is to destroy them before they destroy you.
MACE: Oh, dear.
NYSSA: But it didn't kill Tegan.
DOCTOR: Well, it obviously wanted prisoners. We can't rely on it remaining so benign.
NYSSA: Then we'd better hurry up with that booster.
DOCTOR: Yes. A refresher course in android design might help as well.
MACE: How can you possibly get that?
DOCTOR: I, too, have a ship of sorts. It isn't the most reliable of machines, but it's aged memory banks might contain something of use.
MACE: Then may I accompany you?
DOCTOR: Are you beginning to believe that I'm telling the truth?
MACE: It seems I've little choice.
DOCTOR: Let's see if the coast is clear.
ADRIC: It's solid. We'd never break it down, we'd make too much noise.
TEGAN: Any way through the bars in that window?
ADRIC: Not without a cutting device.
TEGAN: The key's still in the lock.
ADRIC: Can you think of a way to get it in here?
TEGAN: No, can you?
MACE: He has a bracelet.
DOCTOR: I see it.
DOCTOR: They won't do any good.
MACE: You forget, sir, I'm an actor as well as a highwayman.
DOCTOR: The bracelet overrides fear. Unless you're prepared to use them, they're quite useless.
MACE: They're useless anyway. I didn't have time to reload them.
DOCTOR: Go back to the pod.
POACHER: You are the Doctor?
DOCTOR: I am indeed. How do you do?
NYSSA: What's going on out there?
MACE: Controlled villagers.
NYSSA: It didn't take them long to find us.
MACE: The poacher can smell you on the wind.
POACHER: You will come with us.
DOCTOR: Another time, perhaps.
POACHER: Stop!
DOCTOR: Down!
MACE: Right, we are ready to engage them.
DOCTOR: There are three at the moment. Fire those, we could have a dozen to contend with.
MACE: What is that?
DOCTOR: Our friendly neighbourhood axe man.
NYSSA: He'll never cut through that hatch.
DOCTOR: He might get lucky. Could hit an opening mechanism on the other side. Hang on.
DOCTOR: There must be some sort of trigger for the escape hatch.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: I just hope this part of the pod isn't buried. Are you ready?
NYSSA: What are you trying to do?
DOCTOR: Get down!
DOCTOR: Let's go.
TEGAN: Look, there's a fan light above the door.
ADRIC: What's that for?
TEGAN: It's a window to give natural light onto the passage. Steady the stool for me.
TEGAN: I think I can move them.
ADRIC: Let me try. I'm stronger.
TEGAN: Yeah, but not as determined.
ADRIC: What's wrong?
TEGAN: The android.
LEADER: Report.
LEADER: Concentrate on your thoughts!
POACHER : Found. The Doctor. At your craft. But escaped. We are tracking him.
LEADER: Good Change of order. Follow, but do not apprehend. Report when he reaches his Tardis.
MACE: Oh, I'm dead. I'm afraid my frame was never designed for rapid acceleration.
DOCTOR: Well, you can't rest yet.
MACE: I'm not moving from this spot unless supported by a horse.
NYSSA: A horse?
MACE: Yes, the miller has one. You could steal it.
DOCTOR: The miller. Of course. Why didn't I think of that?
NYSSA: Doctor, you can't steal the poor man's horse.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's him I'm interested in, not his horse. He comes and goes from the house as he pleases. Maybe he can help us. Why don't you go back to the Tardis and start work on the booster while we look for him.
NYSSA: Alone?
DOCTOR: Well, you're more than capable.
NYSSA: Well, I
DOCTOR: We may not be able to find the miller. We can't afford to waste any time.
NYSSA: Very well.
DOCTOR: And I'll be back as quickly as I can.
NYSSA: Even sooner, if at all possible.
DOCTOR: Now then, which way to the mill?
MACE: I am not moving.
DOCTOR: Just direct me, then. You can wait here for the poacher and his friend.
MACE: Sir, you have a very mean way of exposing a man's cowardice.
MACE: Ah, the object of my desire.
DOCTOR: Hello!
MACE: Shush! Shush, shush, sir! Thievery is a matter of stealth, not hearty greetings.
DOCTOR: We're here to see the miller.
MACE: You are without pity, sir. Ah!
TEGAN: What are you doing?
ADRIC: What do you think?
TEGAN: I was going to unlock the door for you.
ADRIC: Now she tells me.
LEADER: There is someone in the house. Destroy them. Go!
DOCTOR: Ah, good day. I'm the Doctor. You must be the miller.
DOCTOR: Er, I'd like a word with you. We'll only keep you a moment.
MACE: You heard what the gentleman said.
DOCTOR: No, no. Let him go.
MILLER: Gid up. Walk on. 
TEGAN: Hurry!
ADRIC: It's stiff.
TEGAN: You were boasting of your strength a few minutes ago. Get on with it.
TEGAN: Jump!
ADRIC: What about you?
TEGAN: Get out of here!
TEGAN: I hope you realise this means I've surrendered.
MACE: Are you capable of carrying a tired thespian, eh?
DOCTOR: Nothing in there. Let's get back to the Tardis, help Nyssa.
MACE: Now?
DOCTOR: At once.
VILLAGER: Plague carriers.
MACE: You jest, sir. I am without plague.
VILLAGER: The mark of the plague is on you.
MACE: You're mistaken, sir.
DOCTOR: We haven't got the plague. I can help you. Wait. Listen.
VILLAGER: Execute them!
DOCTOR: Not again.
Part Three
HEADMAN: Wait!
VILLAGER: They must die. They bring plague to the village.
HEADMAN: These men are wanted vandals.
VILLAGER: And the sooner they're dispatched the better.
HEADMAN: They are wanted alive.
POACHER: There is a reward.
VILLAGER: What use is that if you're dead?
HEADMAN: No! I am the head man of your village, you will listen to me.
POACHER: Kill them, scythe man, and you die as well.
HEADMAN: No! Trust me.
DOCTOR: Thank you! I'm the Doctor. I can help
HEADMAN: Lock them in the harness room.
TEGAN: No, please.
LEADER: Do not struggle, and you will feel no pain.
LEADER: Report!
HEADMAN : Carried out your instructions.
LEADER: The primitiveness of these creatures astounds me. Listen to the state of this fool's brain. I said report! Concentrate on your thoughts, then I will hear them.
HEADMAN : The Doctor is my prisoner.
LEADER: Excellent. Bring him to the house at once.
LEADER: Do not try to fight it and you will feel no pain. Do you understand?
TEGAN: Yes.
LEADER: Take these to the cellar and pack them with the rest.
LEADER: Take care not drop them. If you do, you will be dead in minutes. Go.
NYSSA: Adric! What's the matter?
ADRIC: Where's the Doctor?
NYSSA: Come and sit down.
ADRIC: Where is he?
NYSSA: He went to find the miller.
ADRIC: We've got to get back to the house. Tegan's still there.
NYSSA: What happened?
ADRIC: The android caught us escaping, and I had to leave her behind.
NYSSA: Was she hurt?
ADRIC: I don't know! We've got to get back there and find out.
NYSSA: We should wait for the Doctor. We can't take on the android by ourselves.
ADRIC: Why isn't he here? Why's he never around when you want him?
MACE: I have appeared before some of the most hostile audiences in the world. Today I met Death in a cellar, but I've never been so afraid until I met the man with the scythe.
DOCTOR: The headman was wearing a bracelet.
MACE: Should I care? He saved our lives.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for the Terileptils.
MACE: I thought you wanted to meet them.
DOCTOR: Not as their prisoner.
MACE: It couldn't be worse than what we've just experienced.
DOCTOR: It might be more subtle.
MACE: I feel my mind slipping into a bottomless pit of gloom and despair.
DOCTOR: Well, you'd better snatch it back again quickly. The headman's coming. I want to get his bracelet off.
MACE: Is that wise?
DOCTOR: We have no choice. Free of it, we might be able to reason with him.
HEADMAN: You are to be taken to the manor house.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course, of course. But first I would like to thank you very much for saving our lives.
VILLAGER: What happened?
MACE: Well, that didn't get us very far
DOCTOR: It was worth a try.
MACE: So what do we do now, ransom the poacher?
LEADER: Primitive fools! They have allowed the Doctor to disconnect their power packs. Bring me the Doctor and his companion. I want them here. Go!
HEADMAN: I don't remember anything very clearly.
VILLAGER: Who are those two? And why were you taking them to the manor house?
HEADMAN: Was I?
VILLAGER: That's what you said.
HEADMAN: I don't know. I heard a voice and then I was here.
VILLAGER: A voice?
HEADMAN: Find the Doctor, it said, and then I saw a picture of that man inside my head.
VILLAGER: A vision?
HEADMAN: It was horrible! It was horrible! I couldn't control my mind. I had to do what this voice said.
VILLAGER: You were possessed. There's evil at work here. The plague carriers are warlocks as well.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. How is he?
MACE: I think he's asleep.
DOCTOR: He'll be all right.
MACE: But what about us, eh? I think our jailers sound decidedly against us.
DOCTOR: There must be some way out of here. Adric and Tegan are depending on me.
MACE: Wait, wait, wait.
MACE: Maybe I could test the strength of this blade against the planking of the wall.
NYSSA: We'll need the heavy duty cable and an adapter.
ADRIC: Will that thing really work?
NYSSA: Of course.
ADRIC: It doesn't look very portable.
NYSSA: I know. I wish the Doctor would hurry up. He knows far more about these things than I do.
ADRIC: I'll go and look for him.
NYSSA: No. If you missed each other, we'd then have to send out a search party for you.
LEADER: Our work is complete. I will deliver it to our base in London this evening for immediate release. And I have more news. I have discovered a group of time travellers. Soon they will be our prisoners, and their ship under our control.
VILLAGER: Come on, lads, quick as you can. Let's have them burnt before they can work anymore of their magic.
MACE: I fear the gentleman who built this wall knew his trade too well.
DOCTOR: Here, let me try.
MACE: If only we had some of the skills of which we are accused. A small spell would work wonders.
MACE: I didn't say a word.
VILLAGER: Build it high!
HEADMAN: What was that?
VILLAGER: The warlocks are escaping! Quickly!
HEADMAN: Death!
ADRIC: I can't see why you wanted to work in here.
NYSSA: I need the extra space.
ADRIC: Why? You're not going to operate it in here.
NYSSA: Only to test it.
ADRIC: Won't it damage the Tardis?
NYSSA: It's less likely to here than in the console room, and I'm not really sure it will work at all.
ADRIC: It'd better.
DOCTOR: Tegan?
TEGAN: Yes?
MACE: She is wearing a bracelet.
DOCTOR: Concentrate, Tegan. You can override the effects. Concentrate hard. Get back to the Tardis and tell Nyssa what's happening.
DOCTOR: You'd better prepare yourself for a shock.
MACE: What now?
DOCTOR: I don't think you'll have seen anything quite like a Terileptil before.
DOCTOR: It's all right. How do you do? I'm the Doctor. Are you in charge here?
LEADER: You will remain silent.
DOCTOR: Sorry, it's just I'm quite concerned about a couple of friends I left here. I've already seen Tegan, but I'd like to know that the boy Adric is
LEADER: Your friends are of no interest to me.
DOCTOR: Well, that's unfortunate, because we had intended to help you.
LEADER: Help me? You would help a Terileptil?
DOCTOR: To get back to your own planet, yes.
LEADER: You must think me a fool!
DOCTOR: Not at all.
LEADER: Look at me, Doctor. Do you see this? This is not natural to my physiognomy.
DOCTOR: So you've been to prison. What does that matter?
LEADER: How do you know that?
DOCTOR: There's only one place in the universe a Terileptil can acquire such scaring. The tinclavic mines on Raaga.
LEADER: And to be sentenced to Raaga is always for life.
DOCTOR: Terileptian law was never my strong point.
LEADER: Doctor, I am a fugitive. The last place I want to go is home. Only death awaits me there.
DOCTOR: I see your point, but there are countless uninhabited planets you could settle on.
LEADER: Ah, yes, to live a primitive life without grace or beauty.
DOCTOR: You're highly intelligent. You have your android, your skills. Your way of life wouldn't remain primitive for long.
LEADER: But we would have no ship, and without one we would be defenceless, prey to any Terileptil scout party.
DOCTOR: I can take you anywhere you want. A billion light years from your home planet. You'd never be found.
LEADER: No, Doctor, a barren rock in space is not an acceptable alternative, especially when you are my prisoner and your ship is for the taking.
DOCTOR: I can't let you do that.
LEADER: You are not in a position to refuse.
DOCTOR: The Tardis is a very temperamental machine, needing very careful handling.
LEADER: Oh, we shall see that it is handled with the utmost care.
DOCTOR: You didn't take very good care of your own ship.
LEADER: If it not been badly damaged in an asteroid storm, it would have not succumbed to the gravitational pull of this planet.
DOCTOR: I gather it's break-up made an impressive spectacle.
LEADER: It cost the lives of all but myself and three of my comrades.
DOCTOR: There are only four of you?
LEADER: Three now, but it is enough.
DOCTOR: Against the millions who already live on this planet? You'd never establish yourself here.
LEADER: You are assuming we plan to coexist.
DOCTOR: Genocide.
LEADER: The primitives on this planet are too wilful and aggressive. I have little need for them, especially now we have your Tardis.
DOCTOR: You'll find their annihilation more difficult than you think, and the Tardis will not help you.
LEADER: The Tardis will not be necessary.
MACE: This thing is talking of mass murder,
LEADER: Is he a primitive?
DOCTOR: Ahem.
MACE: There is nothing primitive about me, sir.
LEADER: So much pride in something so stupid. I could destroy you now.
MACE: Let me see you try.
LEADER: Fit the primitive with a bracelet.
DOCTOR: He is one untrained man. What will you do when they send thousands of their soldiers against you?
LEADER: Oh, you are so right, Doctor. We cannot fight as warriors, but I have devised a plan that will make that unnecessary.
ADRIC: Are these what you wanted?
NYSSA: That's right.
ADRIC: How much more have you got to do on that?
NYSSA: Not much, although the Doctor will have to check some of the adjustments.
ADRIC: If we ever see him again.
NYSSA: I'm sure he's all right.
ADRIC: What about Tegan?
NYSSA: Try not to worry. You can't do anything for her.
ADRIC: No, I can't do anything for anyone. I can't even help you on that. I'm going to look for the Doctor.
NYSSA: Adric!
ADRIC: He might be in trouble.
NYSSA: And what will you be able to do?
ADRIC: More than just wait.
NYSSA: Adric, where will you go?
ADRIC: To the mill.
NYSSA: You could easily miss him.
ADRIC: So you keep saying. Look, just don't worry, Nyssa. Everything'll be all right.
NYSSA: Adric, no! Oh, why won't he listen to me?
NYSSA: Oh, no!
DOCTOR: A neat idea, dressing the android up as Death.
LEADER: It created the confusion I wanted.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: I saw him in action in the stable.
LEADER: I have always found fear an excellent tool.
DOCTOR: Tell me, what happened to the occupants of this house?
LEADER: A noble death. They were allowed to die fighting.
DOCTOR: I've never been able to reconcile the Terileptil's love of art and beauty with their love of war. Don't I qualify for a bracelet?
LEADER: No. Your mind would override the effects.
DOCTOR: Cruder but more effective, hey?
LEADER: War is honourable, Doctor. Even on this planet it is considered so.
DOCTOR: Oh, I know, but by your admission these people are still primitive. What's your excuse?
NYSSA: Stupid machine!
ADRIC: Get off!
DOCTOR: Oh, for a proper key.
LEADER: Hurry. Help the others.
DOCTOR: Someday I must get a proper survival kit together.
LEADER: Stay where you are, Doctor. Shoot him if he moves. Now, turn around.
LEADER: Drop the sonic device.
DOCTOR: It isn't my day, is it.
DOCTOR: I feel as though you've just killed an old friend.
LEADER: It is with some sadness that I tell you you are about to join it.
DOCTOR: Why not smile and let me live?
LEADER: If I did that, you'd be more of a menace than all the primitives on this planet.
DOCTOR: You overestimate me.
LEADER: And then there would be the argument over the Tardis. Ah, you would have made a useful ally, but I'm afraid I think you are better dead. I said I would demonstrate how I'm to rid this planet of all it's primitives. It's very simple.
DOCTOR: The poor old black rat and his flea.
LEADER: The infection it now carries has been genetically re-engineered. Although heavily infected, it will outlive you all.
DOCTOR: But you'd need thousands of them.
LEADER: I have thousands of them. They are awaiting release in a nearby city. Their infection will kill every living thing.
DOCTOR: I thought the local plague was already doing that?
LEADER: Ah, but our rats will ensure there are no survivors. A final visitation.
DOCTOR: Then who will serve you?
LEADER: Now we have your Tardis, we can travel the universe and acquire androids.
DOCTOR: This carnage isn't necessary.
LEADER: It's survival, Doctor. Just as these primitives kill lesser species to protect themselves, so I kill them.
DOCTOR: That's hardly an argument.
LEADER: It's not supposed to be an argument. It's a statement! If you try to escape or interfere with this cage, your friends' controlled minds have but one thought. To kill you.
DOCTOR: Tegan, I know you never listen to a word I say but, please put the cover back on the cage. You can do it. Just concentrate and you can override the control. Think hard! Cover the cage!
DOCTOR: No, Tegan, don't! Please, listen to me! It's the Doctor. Don't open it! If you do it's the end for us all!
Part Four
DOCTOR: Tegan! Tegan, we haven't got time to fight.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling?
MACE: What happened?
DOCTOR: Steady. You'll be all right.
MACE: How do you know that?
DOCTOR: I'm the Doctor. Take it easy.
LEADER: Go, search for the Tardis, and when you find it, pilot it to the base yourself.
DOCTOR: How do you feel, now?
TEGAN: Groggy, sore and bad-tempered.
DOCTOR: Oh, almost your old self.
TEGAN: It's not very funny. I feel awful. Why is he so full of beans?
MACE: I'm a man of iron.
DOCTOR: It's more likely the electrical charge I gave him. So, what am I to do about these?
MACE: Have no fear, I am at hand. Have you a piece of wire?
DOCTOR: Will this be any good?
MACE: Ah. Interesting device. Perfect! I once knew a French acrobat. He wasn't very good at tumbling, but his skill with a piece of bent iron was phenomenal. Luckily, he passed his skill onto me which enabled me to extricate my fee from the strong boxes of more than one disreputable theatre manager. Eureka!
LEADER: Return to the laboratory. You have my instructions.
MILLER: Gid up. Walk on. Get on.
TEGAN: Can the Terileptil really do what he said?
DOCTOR: Open the cage and find out.
TEGAN: Well, I meant on such a scale?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes.
TEGAN: But to kill all those people, it's monstrous.
DOCTOR: The Terileptils find it disturbingly easy to justify themselves. How are you doing with that lock?
MACE: Gently, sir. Picking a lock is an art.
TEGAN: Can't you use your screwdriver?
TEGAN: What about the gun?
MACE: No, no, no, no. That would be heard.
TEGAN: Can't we risk it?
DOCTOR: Er, just a moment more.
MACE: I'm nearly there.
TEGAN: It's impossible. You can't pick a lock with a safety pin.
MACE: I released the Doctor.
TEGAN: Yeah, but that was handcuffs. I'm talking about a door lock. Look, for all we know the Terileptil and the android could be miles away by now.
DOCTOR: You're right. Stand back.
MACE: Five seconds longer.
DOCTOR: I said, stand back.
MACE: You missed. You wasted our only shot.
DOCTOR: I never miss.
MACE: There's your shot, there is the lock. A span separates them both.
DOCTOR: Try the door.
DOCTOR: You see?
MACE: Impossible. I must have picked it.
NYSSA: Done it.
TEGAN: Not again.
DOCTOR: The master control is overriding the switch. Stack some of these empty boxes up along here.
TEGAN: Now what are you up to?
TEGAN: G'day!
TEGAN: Is he all right?
DOCTOR: Just stunned.
DOCTOR: They've gone.
TEGAN: But where?
DOCTOR: A nearby city. Which is the nearest city?
MACE: London.
TEGAN: We'll never find them there.
DOCTOR: Have a look around. See what papers you can find.
TEGAN: Oh, you think they'll have left a forwarding address?
DOCTOR: Will you! Just look around. There might be something.
MACE: I can't make head nor tail of this.
DOCTOR: You wouldn't.
TEGAN: It's all mathematical formulae.
DOCTOR: Or Terileptian script. You know, I didn't realise their technology was so advanced.
TEGAN: I'm so glad you're impressed.
DOCTOR: What? Oh, yes.
MACE: I mean, we can't even read them.
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Ah, this is it. Let's see them replace this in a hurry.
TEGAN: What is it?
DOCTOR: The control panel. I've disconnected it.
TEGAN: Oh, great. You've liberated a whole lot of villagers. What about the base?
DOCTOR: Oh, we'll find it.
TEGAN: Just like you found Heathrow?
DOCTOR: Let's get back to the Tardis.
ADRIC: Look out!
ADRIC: You did it.
NYSSA: I did it.
ADRIC: You're all right? Not hurt?
NYSSA: I'm fine. Just a little sad. It was such a magnificent machine.
ADRIC: That machine tried to kill you.
NYSSA: It was a slave. It was only doing what it was told. I think we should check how much damage has been done to the Tardis.
ADRIC: What about the Doctor and Tegan?
NYSSA: Where do we look?
ADRIC: Tegan will still be at the house. Now you've destroyed the android it's perfectly safe to go there.
NYSSA: It's beginning to get dark. Aren't you forgetting the woods are still full of your friendly villagers?
ADRIC: We could go in the Tardis.
NYSSA: No, Adric. You move this ship and we could finish up anywhere.
ADRIC: And if we don't, the Doctor and Tegan could finish up dead.
TEGAN: It's still locked.
DOCTOR: So's this.
DOCTOR: Ah, we'll try this one.
TEGAN: Oh, not again.
MACE: That exit is impossible, my dear sir. I would never get through it.
DOCTOR: If you abandoned some of that junk, you might.
MACE: This, my Doctor, is our insurance.
TEGAN: Looks more like overkill to me.
DOCTOR: It's stuck.
TEGAN: Can't be.
DOCTOR: It's been sealed. We'll have to find the back door.
MACE: What is that?
DOCTOR: Help, if we're lucky.
TEGAN: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: I don't know.
TEGAN: Not the android.
NYSSA: Stay calm. Why won't it work?
ADRIC: Perhaps I'm pushing the wrong buttons.
NYSSA: Maybe she was damaged by the booster.
MACE: What is this?
DOCTOR: It may be the only glimpse you ever get of my Tardis.
NYSSA: Try and think what the Doctor would do if he were here.
ADRIC: He'd probably get angry.
NYSSA: I said empathise, not be silly.
ADRIC: Got it!
NYSSA: Brilliant!
TEGAN: At last! You really should get this crate serviced, you know.
ADRIC: We made it. Doctor! Tegan! You're safe.
DOCTOR: So, you got here at last.
TEGAN: Come on, Doctor, be grateful. If nothing else, it saved us a long walk.
DOCTOR: I like long walks.
NYSSA: It worked.
TEGAN: Anyway, I'm pleased to see you.
MACE: I, too, my friend.
ADRIC: Where's the Terileptil?
TEGAN: Ask the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, I knew the booster would work in theory, but practice is another matter.
NYSSA: Thank you.
MACE: This isn't possible.
ADRIC: That's what I thought at first, but it is.
MACE: It's amazing! Quite amazing.
NYSSA: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Ah, in search of our Terileptil.
ADRIC: You know where he is?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's why I'm searching.
TEGAN: Will you, please, tell me why we're doing this?
DOCTOR: Wait and see.
DOCTOR: That's it!
TEGAN: What is it?
DOCTOR: The Terileptil base.
TEGAN: How do you know?
ADRIC: There's something there.
TEGAN: How do you know it's their base?
DOCTOR: It's an electrical emission from a piece of scientific equipment. Not something you'd expect to find in seventeenth century Earth.
TEGAN: Why didn't you say that's what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Because I wasn't looking for it until I found it.
LEADER: Enough!
DOCTOR: Here's an old friend.
ADRIC: But where are the Terileptils? They could be anywhere around here.
DOCTOR: When a miller's cart stands outside a bakery, it isn't hard to deduce where the miller is.
DOCTOR: Almost as if we were expect.
LEADER: Quickly, the door!
 
NYSSA: Where are they?
DOCTOR: Good evening.
LEADER: Welcome, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You were expecting me.
LEADER: I was expecting my android, but if you have brought the Tardis here yourself, so be it.
DOCTOR: I brought the android as well.
LEADER: And your friends. Please, come in, but first put away your gun.
MACE: You jest, sir.
LEADER: No. See.
LEADER: I mean you no harm. I have obviously underestimated you all. Now!
TEGAN: What's that?
DOCTOR: The gun's about to explode!
DOCTOR: Quick, everyone out of here!
NYSSA: Shouldn't we try and help them?
DOCTOR: Too late! That's the soliton machine exploding.
DOCTOR: Wait! Quick, everything into the flames.
MACE: Nightwatchman! Fetch a squirter! Arouse the street!
DOCTOR: We must go. Our presence here would raise too many awkward questions. Can we drop you anywhere?
MACE: I'm afraid your pace of life is a little to fast for me, sir. I shall stay here and fight the fire. A much, much quieter occupation.
DOCTOR: Into the Tardis!
MACE: Goodbye, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Oh, a keepsake.
MACE: Ah.
DOCTOR: Good luck.
NYSSA: Won't it confuse the archaeologists?
MACE: Goodbye, Doctor!
TEGAN: Doctor, shouldn't we have helped put out the fire? We are partially responsible.
DOCTOR: I have a sneaking suspicion this fire should be allowed to run its course.
ADRIC: How do you mean?
DOCTOR: I'll explain someday.
