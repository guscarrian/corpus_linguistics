Black Orchid
Part One
NYSSA: Where are we?
ADRIC: Earth again.
TEGAN: I did say I wanted to stay with the crew for a while. You can stop trying to get me back to Heathrow.
DOCTOR: I have.
TEGAN: You certainly know how to fly this crate, don't you.
DOCTOR: What's the matter, old girl? Why this compulsion for planet Earth?
NYSSA: What is this place?
DOCTOR: A railway station.
TEGAN: Ah, but when?
DOCTOR: Three o'clock, June the 11th, 1925.
TEGAN: I haven't been born yet.
DOCTOR: It's interesting, isn't it. And no jet lag. Shall we go outside?
NYSSA: You think that wise, considering what we've just done to London?
DOCTOR: Oh, that would have happened if we'd been there or not. All part of Earth's history.
NYSSA: I hope you're right.
TEGAN: Well, I'd like to take a look.
DOCTOR: Come on.
ADRIC: So what is a railway station?
DOCTOR: Well, a place where one embarks and disembarks from compartments on wheels, drawn along these rails by a steam engine. Rarely on time.
NYSSA: What a very silly activity.
DOCTOR: You think so? As a boy I always wanted to drive one.
TANNER: Please, sir, if you don't mind. The game's already started. His lordship won the toss and decided to bat first to give you time to get here. That train's always slate.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of his Lordship.
TANNER: Er, yes, sir. But I do think we should hurry. His lordship is a first class bat, but I'm not quite sure how strong his support is this year.
DOCTOR: Come on, you lot.
TEGAN: Now what? Where are we going?
DOCTOR: To a cricket match.
TEGAN: Why?
DOCTOR: Why not?
STATIONMASTER: It's out here on the platform.
STATIONMASTER: Here, what do you make of that, Constable?
CHARLES: Ah, there you are, man, good. I'm Cranleigh. Didn't expect four of you.
CHARLES: Good lord. Er, I'm so sorry. Do forgive me for staring. You look exactly like my fianc�e. It's quite uncanny.
DOCTOR: This is Nyssa.
CHARLES: You must meet her.
DOCTOR: And Adric and Tegan.
CHARLES: How do you do. Well, you'd better pad up, Doctor. Got your gear?
DOCTOR: Ah, I regret I have none.
CHARLES: No matter, I'll fix you up. We're taking a terrible thrashing. 54 for 8. I made a duck.
CHARLES: Smutty said he'd send a useful bat.
DOCTOR: Smutty?
CHARLES: Smutty Thomas. Oh, don't you call him Smutty at Guys?
DOCTOR: Er, no, as a matter of fact.
CHARLES: Oh, he was Smutty at school. Now, the wicket's very green, the ball's keeping low. Any good with the ball?
DOCTOR: Not bad.
CHARLES: Good. Medium pace? Slow?
DOCTOR: Fast.
CHARLES: Top hole.
CHARLES: Good luck, old boy.
DOCTOR: Middle stump!
CHARLES: Well played, sir.
CHARLES: Splendid!
CHARLES: Mother, may I introduce Tegan and Adric.
LADY C: How do you do? What enchanting names.
CHARLES: And this is Nyssa.
LADY C: How extraordinary!
CHARLES: Yes, isn't it.
LADY C: Worcestershire.
CHARLES: Apparently not.
LADY C: Nyssa, did you say?
CHARLES: Yes.
LADY C: Forgive me, my dear, but you must be a Worcestershire Talbot.
NYSSA: No, I'm not.
LADY C: Are you quite sure?
NYSSA: Quite sure.
LADY C: Robert?
MUIR: Uncanny. Quite uncanny.
LADY C: Two peas in a pod. Positively two peas in a pod.
NYSSA: I beg your pardon?
LADY C: Forgive a pardonably curiosity, my dear, but where are you from?
NYSSA: The Empire of Traken.
LADY C: Really.
LADY C: Your Doctor substitute has made your score almost respectable, Charles.
CHARLES: Perfectly ripping performance. Much better player than Smutty.
DOCTOR: Howzat!
TEGAN: Oh, well bowled!
WICKET: Howzat!
CHARLES: Well done.
DOCTOR: Howzat!
DOCTOR: Howzat!
DOCTOR: Howzat!
CHARLES: Ripping performance, old boy. Come over to the house and meet the mater.
CHARLES: Mother, may I present the Doctor.
LADY C: How do you do?
DOCTOR: How do you do.
LADY C: Doctor who?
CHARLES: I'm sorry, Mother, but he'd like to remain incognito, and I think we should respect that after what he's done today.
LADY C: Of course.
MUIR: First rate, sir.
CHARLES: Sir Robert Muir, the Chief Constable.
MUIR: A superb innings, worthy of the master.
DOCTOR: The Master?
MUIR: Well, the other doctor.
MUIR: W G Grace.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.
LADY C: Are you able to stay for the ball, Doctor?
CHARLES: Yes, you must. I insist now, all of you.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
LADY C: We have one every year in aid of the Hospital for Sick Children.
TEGAN: It's fancy dress, isn't it?
CHARLES: Yes.
TEGAN: We haven't got any costumes.
MUIR: I was just thinking how charming yours was.
CHARLES: Costumes are no problem. We keep a selection for last minute guests. I'm sure we can fix you up. Well, Doctor, how would you like to take a cocktail to your bath?
DOCTOR: Well, certainly a cold drink.
ADRIC: What do you do with a cocktail in a bath?
CHARLES: Drink it, old boy.
CHARLES: Ah, Ann, my dear. Come and meet the hero of the day, and.
DOCTOR: Great Scott.
CHARLES: Ann Talbot, my fianc�e, this is Nyssa.
ANN: How do you do?
NYSSA: How do you do?
CHARLES: And this is the Doctor, and Tegan and Adric.
ANN: Worcester. Have you an Uncle Percy?
LADY C: Not a Worcestershire Talbot.
ANN: Then where are you from?
NYSSA: Traken.
ANN: Where's that?
MUIR: Near Esher, isn't it?
ANN: Could there be Talbots near Esher?
LADY C: Not possible. The hunt isn't good enough.
CHARLES: Well, Doctor, what can I offer you? Brewster here can make absolutely anything quite superbly.
DOCTOR: Well, I do have a terrible thirst. Perhaps a lemonade with lots of ice.
CHARLES: Ann?
ANN: The same as the Doctor, please.
CHARLES: My dear?
TEGAN: A screwdriver, please.
CHARLES: Ah, a screwdriver, Brewster. And?
NYSSA: Thank you. I'll have the same.
CHARLES: Better make that orange juice for the children, Brewster.
BREWSTER: My lord.
CHARLES: Bob, same again?
MUIR: Thank you, Charles.
CHARLES: And a Tom Collins.
DOCTOR: Well, it's very charming of you to make us so welcome.
ANN: Not at all, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
CHARLES: Thank you. Shall we?
ANN: Are you really from Esher?
NYSSA: I don't even know where Esher is.
TEGAN: How beautiful.
LADY C: The black orchid. Yes, it is beautiful. It was found on the Orinoco by my eldest son, George.
TEGAN: Of course. I thought I recognised the name. George Cranleigh the botanist, the explorer.
LADY C: But the Brazilian forests took their toll. He never returned from his last expedition two years ago.
TEGAN: I'm sorry.
LADY C: Ann was engaged to him, but I'm delighted to say that we're still going to have her in the family.
MUIR: If Charles marries the right girl.
ANN: Nyssa doesn't even know where Esher is.
LADY C: Which shows great taste. I'm sorry, Nyssa. Our curiosity has been vulgar enough. It's high time we all change.
CHARLES: Yes, well, I'm ready for a bath, so if the ladies will excuse us, I'll show you to your room, Doctor. Bring your drink.  You too, old boy.
CHARLES: Well, I must flatter myself. Call that an admirable choice.
DOCTOR: It certainly is. What are you going to wear?
CHARLES: Ah, that's better left as a surprise, I think. Now then, I'd better attend to that young man. What was his name again?
DOCTOR: Adric.
CHARLES: Scandinavian?
DOCTOR: Er, not quite. He's Alzarian.
CHARLES: I never could remember all those funny Baltic bits. Geography was never my strong point. My brother stole all the thunder there. Positive Odin. Till later, then.
DOCTOR: Yes.
NYSSA: You know the dances of this period?
TEGAN: Well, I know the Charleston. I learned it for a play when I was at school.
NYSSA: How's it performed?
TEGAN: I'll show you.
NYSSA: Is that dancing?
TEGAN: Well, it's not bad.
NYSSA: No, it's just that on Traken our dancing is much more formalised, and far more complex.
TEGAN: You dance?
NYSSA: It's part of my training. And although I say it myself, I'm considered quite good.
TEGAN: Come in.
ANN: My dears, I've had an absolutely ripping idea.
NYSSA: Oh, how lovely. That's lovely.
ANN: My dear, I'm so glad you think so. Look.
ANN: There. With the headdress nobody, but nobody, will be able to tell us apart. Isn't that topping?
NYSSA: Quite topping.
ANN: Just as long as I don't show this.
TEGAN: A mole?
ANN: Yes. You haven't got one, have you?
NYSSA: No.
ANN: Good.
DOCTOR : I want to be happy, but I can't be happy, till I make you
DOCTOR : Hello?
DOCTOR: Who's that?
LADY C: Splendid.
NYSSA: I rather think this will be fun. I think you have to ask me to dance.
ADRIC: Why?
NYSSA: Because that's what everybody else is doing.
ADRIC: What, all those people?
NYSSA: Not me, you idiot. Each other. Come on, ask me.
ADRIC: I don't think I could do it.
NYSSA: Yes, you can. Just follow me. Come on.
MUIR: I hope Lord Cranleigh's dancing with the right girl. It's a little naughty, really.
TEGAN: I think it's a great hoot.
MUIR: A great what?
TEGAN: Hoot.
MUIR: Hoot. Oh yes.
CHARLES: There is one way of not getting you mixed up.
ANN: What's that?
CHARLES: By having every dance with you.
ANN: Foiled again. You're the host.
ADRIC: Nyssa?
NYSSANN: Guess.
CHARLES: Ann?
NYSSANN: Guess.
MUIR: I might have known they were up to something. Now no one can tell them apart.
TEGAN: I can.
MUIR: How?
TEGAN: That's a secret.
NYSSANN: Where's the Doctor?
ADRIC: Don't know.
NYSSANN: What's he wearing?
ADRIC: I don't know that either.
NYSSANN: You should ask Lady Cranleigh to dance.
ADRIC: Well, look, I'm not really very good at it. Anyway, I'd much rather eat.
MAN: Shall we dance?
DOCTOR: Why didn't I leave after the cricket?
LADY C: You'll have to excuse me for a moment.
LADY C: Latoni, what are you doing here? Get back to your quarters at once.
LATONI: My friend has escaped.
LADY C: What?
LATONI: He hit me from behind and escaped.
LADY C: Where was Digby?
LATONI: Digby has gone.
LADY C: Where?
LATONI: I don't know. I have not seen him today.
LADY C: Come with me.
CHARLES: I've got every chance of having all 
DOCTOR: At last!
DOCTOR: Wherever this is.
MUIR: You deserve a better dancer than me, my dear. I must find you someone your own age.
TEGAN: But you're a beaut dancer, Sir Robert.
MUIR: Beaut? That, I think, is a great hoot.
TEGAN: The Charleston!
MUIR: What? Oh.
CHARLES: Marvellous! Absolutely excellent!
CHARLES: Oh, excuse me.
ADRIC: Enjoying yourself, Nyssa? 
NYSSANN: Nyssa? Are you sure, Adric?
ADRIC: Yes. You can't do that.
NYSSANN: Can't I?
DOCTOR: Hello?
DOCTOR: Hello?
DOCTOR: Hello?
DOCTOR: Portuguese.
DOCTOR: Well, one of these must get me out of here.
ANN: That was great fun. Shall we go back to the terrace? I'm afraid we must return to the others. Who are you?
ANN: Let me go. Please let me go! Stop it! Let me go, whoever you are! Help! Help!
LADY C: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Lady Cranleigh.
LADY C: This is Dittar Latoni, an old friend from Brazil.
DOCTOR: How do you do?
LATONI: Sir.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid I'm lost.
LADY C: You are indeed.
DOCTOR: I should explain.
LADY C: Please don't. There's no need.
DOCTOR: Oh, but there is. You see, in my meanderings I've come across something rather unpleasant.
LADY C: Go on.
DOCTOR: There's a body through there.
LADY C: What!
DOCTOR: A dead man in a cupboard.
LADY C: Oh, really!
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's true. May I show you?
LADY C: Please do.
LADY C: Allow me.
DOCTOR: Fascinating.
LADY C: Ten bedrooms and four receptions have access to this area.
DOCTOR: A larger than average priest hole.
LADY C: The Cranleighs of the time were devout and very hospitable. The priesthood came here from all over the country.
DOCTOR: It's in here. Are you sure you want to look?
LADY C: It's all right, Doctor. I'm made of quite stern stuff.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.
LADY C: Poor fellow. How very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Do you know him?
LADY C: Yes, he's one of the servants. Please.
LADY C: I'm very sorry, Doctor, that you've had this dreadful experience. I wonder, would you be kind enough to help me keep it from my other guests? I wouldn't want to upset them.
DOCTOR: Well
LADY C: There's no point in involving them, unless the police decide otherwise.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course.
LADY C: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Now, if you could tell me how to get back to my room, I think it's about time I got changed.
LADY C: Yes, I'll show you.
TEGAN: I wonder where the Doctor is?
MUIR: Well, it could be a number of these fellows, since he wishes to remain incognito. Not being bored by this old codger, are you?
TEGAN: Of course not, Sir Robert.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
ANN: Let me out!
ANN: I had such an awful dream. My head's throbbing.
LADY C: Oh, there, there, my dear. There, there.
ANN: How did I get here? I hurt my head. There was someone in fancy dress.
LADY C: Try to put the whole incident out of your mind.
ANN: I can't. It was too awful.
LADY C: Come on. Some brandy will help calm you down.
BREWSTER: Some more of this, sir?
ADRIC: Er, no thank you. This will do to be going along with.
BREWSTER: Where's James with that bucket? Hurry him up will you, Henry?
HENRY: Yes.
CHARLES: A cold collation?
NYSSA: What's that?
CHARLES: Something to eat.
NYSSA: Oh, yes, please.
NYSSA: Is that seconds?
ADRIC: So?
NYSSA: You pig!
ADRIC: You can only be Nyssa.
NYSSA: Just look at that!
ADRIC: Well, I didn't have any breakfast.
MUIR: Of course, my dear.
TEGAN: Thank you.
MUIR: Lord Cranleigh.
CHARLES: Sir Robert.
TEGAN: Have you seen the Doctor?
NYSSA: No.
TEGAN: Sure you've got enough there? 
ADRIC: Don't you start.
CHARLES: His neck's broken.
MUIR: By the look of him, it couldn't have happened in a fall.
CHARLES: What's that?
CHARLES: Ann was wearing this.
MUIR: Or the other one.
CHARLES: No, no, that was the other one out there on the terrace. Something's happened to Ann.
MUIR: I'll telephone the station.
DOCTOR: Had an accident?
CHARLES: I'm afraid it's a little more serious than that, Doctor.
ANN: That's him! That's who attacked me!
DOCTOR: It's me.
ANN: Yes, you. And he did that. I saw him.
CHARLES: Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid Miss Talbot is mistaken. I've just this minute come down the stairs.
ANN: I am not mistaken! He danced with me and then pulled me in here. I shouted for help, James came and he killed him.
DOCTOR: I say, look here.
ANN: Sir Robert! Arrest that man. He killed James. I saw him.
DOCTOR: Lady Cranleigh, please.
LADY C: Charles, shouldn't you
MUIR: No, Madge. Wait until the Sergeant gets here.
LADY C: But our guests
MUIR: I suggest, Charles, that you call it a day. Tell your guests there's been an accident and ask them to go home.
CHARLES: What about him?
MUIR: I'll deal with this.
CHARLES: Right-o.
MUIR: Now, Ann.
ANN: This man attacked me and then killed James.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
ANN: You did! He did. He danced with me on the terrace, brought me in here and then he
DOCTOR: Miss Talbot is quite mistaken. I have just come down these stairs. Before that, I was. Wait a minute. Was I like this?
ANN: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well, that's it, then.
MUIR: What is it?
DOCTOR: A completely logical explanation. A duplication of fancy dress. Someone else must be wearing an identical costume.
ANN: No.
MUIR: But my dear.
ANN: No!
MUIR: Now be reasonable.
ANN: I am being reasonable.
MUIR: What about your own costume? There are two of those.
ANN: My little joke, Sir Robert. I was in charge of the costumes. There was only one harlequin. That one.
MUIR: Doctor?
DOCTOR: And only one murderer. Lady Cranleigh, I agreed to keep it from your guests, but I have the distinct feeling I'm in rather hot water.
DOCTOR: Miss Talbot.
ANN: Yes?
DOCTOR: Why?
ANN: Why what?
DOCTOR: Why would I attack you? Have you done me any harm?
ANN: No!
DOCTOR: No, then I've no reason to harm you. And besides
MUIR: Besides what?
DOCTOR: Well, it wouldn't be cricket.
LADY C: Robert.
MUIR: I respect the sentiment, sir, but I have known Miss Talbot all her life. She has laid a complaint.
LADY C: Ahem.
MUIR: Made an accusation. There's more to this than meets the eye. Is this the reason that you wish to remain incognito?
DOCTOR: No, of course not.
MUIR: What is your name?
DOCTOR: That's a very difficult question.
MUIR: Have you any means of identification?
DOCTOR: No, I've never needed any.
MUIR: Fortunate man. Just exactly who are you and what are you doing here?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
MUIR: I am the Chief Constable of this county and you, sir, are under suspicion of murder.
DOCTOR: I'm a Time Lord.
MUIR: A what?
DOCTOR: I told you.
MUIR: Try again.
DOCTOR: I travel in time and space. I have a time machine. You've read H G Wells?
MUIR: I know of him, of course, yes. He writes fiction.
DOCTOR: Lady Cranleigh, please help me.
MUIR: How can Lady Cranleigh help you?
DOCTOR: There's something terribly wrong here. Lady Cranleigh knows. I showed her another dead body.
MUIR: What? Madge?
LADY C: I'm afraid like Mister Well, the Doctor has a vivid imagination.
DOCTOR: I showed you a body in a cupboard up there. You and the Indian.
MUIR: Indian?
DOCTOR: An Indian, with a lip. I give up.
MUIR: Perhaps you'd show me?
DOCTOR: Willingly. This way.
ANN: Please don't leave me.
LADY C: Go and find Charles, my dear.
ADRIC: I don't believe it. The Doctor would never do a thing like that.
TEGAN: We can all speak for him.
NYSSA: Yes.
CHARLES: Miss Talbot was a witness.
ADRIC: Her word against his.
CHARLES: That's enough. You'd better get inside the house. The police will be here any minute.
BREWSTER: There's a telephone call for you, sir.
DOCTOR: This one.
LADY C: My father gave me that when I was six.
DOCTOR: Where's the Indian? There was an Indian. I showed you the body of a man in there. A man of about thirty, in a white coat. A short white coat. You said he was a servant.
MUIR: An Indian?
DOCTOR: Well, not in there, no. With Lady Cranleigh. A South American native.
MUIR: Madge?
DOCTOR: I'm not imagining all this.
MUIR: No?
DOCTOR: Lady Cranleigh, I appeal to you. It was you who introduced me to this man.
MUIR: The man in the cupboard.
DOCTOR: No, the Indian.
MUIR: With the lip?
DOCTOR: Yes. His name was Ditoni, or something like that. You said he was a friend from Brazil.
MUIR: From Brazil?
DOCTOR: Where the nuts come from.
CHARLES: Hello? Cranleigh here. Smutty! Now listen, that fellow you sent us. What? What? Well, there was a fellow here. Yes. Won the blessed game for us. First class bat and a demon bowler.
MUIR: You refuse to name yourself or give any good account of yourself except some irresponsible fiction, and you were seen to kill a man. Heaven knows what your motive was, but no doubt that will come out during the course of the enquiries.
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope so.
CHARLES: Bob, I've just received a telephone call from Smutty Thomas, apologising for the fact that the replacement he arranged missed his train.
LADY C: Then this man is an imposter as well.
CHARLES: Indeed.
TEGAN: Is he?
CHARLES: I beg your pardon?
TEGAN: I don't know what this is all about, but I do know that the Doctor is no imposter.
CHARLES: I've just received a telephone call from
MUIR: All right, Charles. I'm arresting this man, Sergeant, on suspicion of murder.
MARKHAM: Yes, Sir Robert.
MUIR: I must warn you that anything you say will be taken down and may be used in evidence.
DOCTOR: That's very kind of you.
MUIR: I shall prefer the charge later at the Station, Sergeant.
MARKHAM: Very good, Sir Robert.
MUIR: His accomplices must come too.
DOCTOR: Accomplices?
MUIR: Well, perhaps I should say accessories.
NYSSA: What are accessories?
MUIR: Accessories to murder. And they suffer the same penalty.
MARKHAM: Right, you'd better all come along with me, then.
CHARLES: Tanner will take you, Bob.
MUIR: Thank you, Charles.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Lady Cranleigh, for a delightfully unexpected afternoon.
NYSSA: Why don't you show them the Tardis, Doctor?
ADRIC: What will that prove?
TEGAN: That he isn't lying.
DOCTOR: Sergeant, do we pass the station?
MARKHAM: You're going to the station.
DOCTOR: I mean the railway station.
MARKHAM: Yes.
DOCTOR: Would you stop there a moment?
MARKHAM: Certainly not.
TEGAN: Oh, please?
DOCTOR: There's vital evidence that will prove what I'm saying is true.
MARKHAM: What evidence?
DOCTOR: Stop, and I'll show you.
MUIR: What's the idea?
DOCTOR: There's something I'd like to show you.
MUIR: Well?
DOCTOR: It's not here.
MUIR: What?
DOCTOR: What I wanted to show you.
MUIR: Come along, Markham. He's wasting time.
CUMMINGS: Did you see it, Sarge?
MARKHAM: See what?
CUMMINGS: The police box in the yard.
MARKHAM: No.
CUMMINGS: It was on the north bound platform at the railway station. We've been able to move it, but we can't break in. No key will unlock it.
DOCTOR: This one will.
LADY C: The male nurse was killed.
CHARLES: Digby? When?
LADY C: Must have been last night.
CHARLES: And you said nothing?
LADY C: No. It would do no good.
CHARLES: Do no good? We can't let that Doctor fellow suffer for something he hasn't done.
LADY C: He will come to no harm. He is innocent.
CHARLES: We've got to tell the police.
LADY C: No!
ANN: Charles, please don't leave me alone.
CHARLES: Ann. Now there's something you've got to know.
LADY C: No, Charles!
CHARLES: Yes, Mother!
DOCTOR: Please.
DOCTOR: After you, Sergeant.
MARKHAM: But there won't be any room.
TEGAN: You are in for a surprise.
MUIR: Unbelievable. Quite unbelievable.
MUIR: I must say, all this is going to be rather difficult to explain in my report. In this sense, you are owed an apology.
DOCTOR: In this sense?
MUIR: Well, there is still a murder to be explained.
CUMMINGS : Sir Robert?
DOCTOR: Come in.
CUMMINGS: Strike me pink!
MUIR: What is it, Cummings?
CUMMINGS: A call from Lord Cranleigh, sir, up at the Hall. He's found another body. A man called Digby. His neck's broken, just like the servant, James.
DOCTOR: The man in the cupboard?
MUIR: Yes. Thank you, Cummings.
CUMMINGS: Sir.
MUIR: Come on, Markham.
DOCTOR: I could get you there sooner.
MUIR: You could? All right, you do that.
ANN: How could you? Oh, how could you?
ANN: Oh, Sir Robert!
CHARLES: Now, Mother, don't worry. I'll look after Ann.
LADY C: Yes, I know.
CHARLES: All right, old chap. All right.
ADRIC: Nyssa!
CHARLES: He's started a fire! Get the Brigade!
DOCTOR: The stairs are burning!
MUIR: What was that thing?
DOCTOR: Tell him, Lady Cranleigh, and why he's so interested in Ann.
MUIR: Well?
LADY C: They were engaged to be married. That thing, as you call him, was my elder son George.
CHARLES: How did you know?
DOCTOR: The black orchid for one, Latoni for another.
MUIR: Explain!
DOCTOR: I'll leave Lady Cranleigh to do that. I have to rescue Nyssa.
LADY C: He won't hurt her. He loves Ann.
DOCTOR: Really. And what will he do when he discovers he has the wrong girl?
CHARLES: There they are!
DOCTOR: Try and hold his attention here. I'll find a way up through the house.
MUIR: No, lad. Two are enough.
LADY C: I've done something terribly wrong, Robert. Charles is not to blame.
MUIR: What did the Doctor mean about the black orchid?
LADY C: Well, you saw how George looked. The Kojabe Indians did that to him. To them, the black orchid is sacred. And they cut out his tongue. His mind was affected. He was rescued by another tribe, and their chief befriended him and brought him home.
MUIR: Latoni.
LADY C: Yes. With Latoni and Digby's help I was able to keep George hidden in the house.
MUIR: Did George kill Digby?
LADY C: Yes.
MUIR: And the servant?
CHARLES: George. Please, George. Now George, she's done you no harm.
CHARLES: George. Please, George.
DOCTOR: George, that isn't Ann. Ann is down there. Look.
DOCTOR: Keep still, Nyssa! It's true, George. Please let me have her. Please.
CHARLES: Thank you, George.
LADY C: I'm grateful you stayed for the funeral.
NYSSA: What's that?
TEGAN: Our fancy dress. Do you really mean it? We can keep them?
ANN: Of course.
LADY C: There's something I'd like you to have.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I shall treasure it.
