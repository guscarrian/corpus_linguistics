The Horns of Nimon
Part One
COPILOT: When are we going to get modern equipment? Proper battleships? When are we going to fight again?
PILOT: It's only a matter of a short time now.
COPILOT: The computer's malfunctioning again.
PILOT: I warned you, you're overloading it. The instructions are quite clear. Until we get new equipment we must reroute all subsidiary functions through the backup computer.
COPILOT: But that takes hours to do!
PILOT: We're twelve hours out from Aneth. Only another twelve to Skonnos.
COPILOT: Be a lot faster if this equipment worked properly.
PILOT: Nimon will soon fulfil his great promise to us.
PILOT: We must be patient.
COPILOT: Patient? Patience is the virtue of the weak. Skonnons are meant to fight, to conquer, to rule, as in the days when these ships were built.
PILOT: We'll fight, and Nimon will give us all we need.
COPILOT: When?
PILOT: When we have fulfilled our part of the contract.
COPILOT: Oh, really?
PILOT: This is to be the last shipment.
COPILOT: The last?
PILOT: Yes. Our part of the contract will be fulfilled.
COPILOT: With this cargo?
PILOT: Yes.
COPILOT: I'll go and check it's safe.
COPILOT: Weakling scum!
[Spaceship bridge}
PILOT: How are they?
COPILOT: Same as the cargo always is. Inferior, craven beings. They'd have to be to surrender to us on an old ship like this.
PILOT: The Anethans remember the old days, when these were the most feared ships in the skies. Before we started fighting amongst ourselves.
COPILOT: Twelve hours to Skonnos. We can do it in six, right?
PILOT: Not without overloading the computer.
COPILOT: It can take it. We could do it in nine hours, okay?
PILOT: Well, it means cutting out the dogleg round sector L seventy five.
COPILOT: It means getting home quickly with this last cargo.
PILOT: Well, double check the programme. We mustn't overload it.
COPILOT: It hardly matters. This ship will never have to fly again. See? No problems at all. We could do it in six hours.
PILOT: Six hours? You said nine hours.
COPILOT: It'll make it.
PILOT: You blundering fool! You've wrecked it. The automatic pilot's gone dead.
COPILOT: Well, it'll be all right, won't it? We can fly her on manual.
PILOT: We're off course already.
COPILOT: All we have to do is to find the beacon again.  There, there's the beacon. We can fly back to it.
PILOT: We're moving further away from it.
COPILOT: Well, push the engines up to full power!
PILOT: You blundering idiot! The ship's completely out of control!
COPILOT: Steer, blast you! Steer!
PILOT: It's not working. There's nothing we can do.
TEKA: Seth, what's happening?
SETH: I don't know.
TEKA: You'll look after me, won't you?
SETH: Of course I will.
PILOT: The engines! They'll blow!
DOCTOR: There. That should immobilise her for the moment.
K9: Correction, master. The Tardis is moving.
DOCTOR: When making modifications, it's extremely important to shut everything down except that which is not necessary to shut down. Well, of course. Terribly easy to damage things otherwise.
DOCTOR: Ow! Like me, for instance. I'd better disconnect that. Good, that should hold her steady.
K9: Repeat, master. The Tardis is moving.
DOCTOR: How can it be? I just completely immobilised her.
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
K9: Still moving, and accelerating.
DOCTOR: What? But K9, how can it be?
ROMANA: He could be right, you know.
DOCTOR: What do you mean, he could be right? How could he possibly be right? He's only a dog, you know.
ROMANA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: We do seem to be moving.
ROMANA: Very fast.
DOCTOR: Yes. But everything's off. Except what's on, of course.
ROMANA: Doctor, what have you been doing?
DOCTOR: Well, I've just been trying out a little idea I had for a slight modification of the conceptual geometer.
ROMANA:  This is an old ship.
DOCTOR: So what?
ROMANA: Don't you think that's a bit dangerous?
DOCTOR: No, I don't. What could possibly go
DOCTOR: Ow! Wrong. You know, I've simply got to stop saying that. Every single time I say what could possibly go wrong, something goes
DOCTOR: Oh! It's uncanny, isn't it?
ROMANA: A gravitational field?
DOCTOR: There are no planets in the sector.
ROMANA: But Doctor, we are moving.
DOCTOR: Romana, do you think I'd dismantle half the control systems including the conceptual geometer, the dematerialisation circuits
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: The dematerialisation circuits. Do you think I'd do that if there was the slightest risk of our being brought into a gravitational field?
ROMANA: You've immobilised the dematerialisation circuits
DOCTOR: It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Stay calm. Watch.
DOCTOR: There we are. Look. Nothing. Blackness.
ROMANA: It may be black, but we are moving very fast.
DOCTOR: Romana, we're moving very fast.
ROMANA: Are we falling into a black hole?
DOCTOR: No. It's not pulling hard enough for that. Anyway, there's nothing charted.
ROMANA: I hope you're right, because we can't dematerialise.
DOCTOR: Fascinating, isn't it? I wonder what it would be like to be crushed to a singularity?
ROMANA: Don't stand there wondering, do something.
DOCTOR: Hmm? What?
ROMANA: Put it together again.
DOCTOR: Oh, right, right. K9. We'll put it together again. I need your help, K9.
DOCTOR: Ow! You all right, K9?
DOCTOR: K9? K9, are you all right? K9!
DOCTOR: K9. Come on, boy. Sorry about this, K9.
DOCTOR: K9, all you all right?
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
DOCTOR: It's all right. It's only the defence shields.
ROMANA: Only? Can you fix them?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I can fix anything, given time.
ROMANA: Which is exactly what we don't have.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: Look.
ROMANA: There is something. It's tiny. How can something so minute have such an enormous gravitational pull?
DOCTOR: How interesting. Ha, looks like a spaceship.
ROMANA: And we're heading straight for it.
COPILOT: Hello, Skonnos. Skonnos, can you hear me? Skonnos. Come in, Skonnos Control. Can you hear me?
SOLDEED: I have spoken with the Nimon.
SORAK: And what does he say, Soldeed?
SOLDEED: He says many things. He speaks of the great journey of life. He speaks of conquest. He speaks of Skonnos rising from its own ashes with wings of fire.
SORAK: Does he speak of the new ships?
SOLDEED: He says we shall have them, and soon. The new sacrifices from Aneth are the last that he demands.
SORAK: Then we really are on the brink of having the promise fulfilled.
SOLDEED: I believe we are, Sorak. I do believe we are. The Second Skonnon Empire will be born.
DOCTOR: It's no good. I can't fix them in time.
ROMANA: You mean we have no defence shields?
DOCTOR: Yes.
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: What is it, K9?
K9: Collision imminent.
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: You were right, K9. We have arrived.
ROMANA: Where?
DOCTOR: Well, we're jammed up against that spaceship. Pretty battered old ship. Been here for years. Centuries, probably. I think we'll go and take a look.
ROMANA: It's not going to be easy to get across there.
DOCTOR: No. Ah, here's a notion. The defence shield on the door's on a different circuit. It might be possible to extrude it.
ROMANA: How?
DOCTOR: Watch.
DOCTOR: There. What do you think of that?
ROMANA: Well done, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was nothing, nothing. K9?
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: Romana?
ROMANA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Let's go.
DOCTOR: Ah ha.
DOCTOR: Oh, how commonplace. It looks like a crystalline rock of some kind.
ROMANA: Hymetusite.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do believe it is.
ROMANA: Hymetusite is highly radioactive!
DOCTOR: What?
K9: Master, I detect ultra-radiation level Q seven point three two five.
DOCTOR: Thank you, K9. And now?
K9: Level falling. Q one point eight six one, falling.
DOCTOR: Good. Now listen, K9. We're going to explore this ship and see what makes it tick.
K9: Source of radiation probably hymetusite crystalline
DOCTOR: Not that sort of ticking, K9.
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: Listen, I want you to go back to the Tardis control room and check out all the damage. Inspect all circuits so we see what we need to put right.
K9: Affirmative, master.
DOCTOR: Off you go then.
ROMANA: I suppose it's some sort of freighter.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. No one in his right mind would mix hymetusite and passengers.
ROMANA: I wonder where it was heading?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Door's locked.
DOCTOR: Hello. How long have you been here, eh? Come, it's all right. Don't be frightened. Don't be frightened. Here, have a jelly baby. Go on, go on.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's all right. Go on, you show them.
DOCTOR: There we are. Now you have one. Go on, you can do it.
DOCTOR: No, I'll have that one. Here, pass them round. One each. Now, how long have you been here?
SETH: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm the Doctor. This is Romana. Who are you?
SETH: Seth.
TEKA: He is Prince of Aneth.
DOCTOR: Aneth! That's a charming place.
SETH: You've been to Aneth?
DOCTOR: Yes, but not yet.
SETH: Oh.
TEKA: Where are we now?
DOCTOR: Nowhere.
ROMANA: Where were you going?
SETH: Skonnos.
DOCTOR: Skonnos?
SETH: We are the bearers of Aneth's tribute to the Nimon.
DOCTOR: What?
TEKA: We are the bearers of Aneth's tribute to the Nimon.
DOCTOR: No, that's all right. I heard what you said. I was just thinking what a curious thing to be.
SETH: We were on our way to Skonnos when something went wrong with the ship.
DOCTOR: What?
SETH: It felt as if it went out of control. There was a crash, then silence, and here we are.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, here, as you so rightly say, we are. Huh.
SETH: What's that?
DOCTOR: Another thing's been drawn into the ship.
ROMANA: A gravity whirlpool?
DOCTOR: Yes. Sargasso Sea in space. Romana?
ROMANA: Yes?
DOCTOR: Suppose, just suppose, someone were beginning to create a black hole.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: Artificially, I mean.
ROMANA: Can it be done?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Fix gravity beam, attract matter to one point in space, and when there's enough it starts to collapse to a singularity. But who'd want to do that?
ROMANA: Is it my imagination, or is the gravity increasing all the time?
DOCTOR: I'd say it was increasing.
SETH: What's happening?
DOCTOR: Unless we find a way of getting out of here, we're all going to be crushed to a singularity.
TEKA: What's a singularity?
ROMANA: A mathematical point with no dimensions.
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind about that. Seth, who's in charge of this ship?
COPILOT: I am.
DOCTOR: Ah, pleased to see you.
COPILOT: Who are you? What are you doing with the sacrifices?
DOCTOR: Sacrifices?
COPILOT: Sacrifices to the Nimon. Who are you, space pirates?
DOCTOR: No!
COPILOT: Why should I believe that?
DOCTOR: Well, that's a good question. Er, can you get us out of here?
COPILOT: Can you?
DOCTOR: I might be able to. Why don't you put that thing away and show me your controls?
COPILOT: Through there.
DOCTOR: Aren't you going to put that thing away?
COPILOT: Through there!
DOCTOR: Well, all right, if that's the way you want to play it.
DOCTOR : Though how I'm going to mend the controls with my arms up in the air like this
COPILOT: Weakling scum!
DOCTOR: Hello, who's that?
COPILOT: The pilot.
DOCTOR: Ah.
COPILOT: He's dead.
DOCTOR: What?
COPILOT: He crashed the ship.
DOCTOR: But the ship hasn't crashed.
COPILOT: Well, it went out of control. At least the cargo is safe.
ROMANA: He means the hymetusite.
COPILOT: I mean the sacrifices.
ROMANA: Sacrifices?
COPILOT: The Anethans. I have to get them safely to Skonnos, whatever happens. They are our payment in the great contract.
DOCTOR: I don't like the sound of that.
COPILOT: It doesn't matter what you like the sound of.
SOLDEED: Why doesn't it respond?
SORAK: Soldeed?
SOLDEED: Leave me, Sorak. I'm engaged in important work.
SORAK: But sir, this is very important. I don't know how to tell you.
SOLDEED: Begin at the beginning and end at the end, Sorak.
SORAK: Well, it's the transport from Aneth, sir. The ship bringing the final sacrifices?
SOLDEED: What about it?
SORAK: It's disappeared.
SOLDEED: Disappeared? What are you talking about?
SORAK: Completely vanished, sir. The last two routine signals have not yet arrived. We thought it might be just a communications fault, but nothing we can do can raise them at all. There's absolutely no trace.
SOLDEED: No trace? Do everything in your power to locate that ship.
SORAK: Sir, I have!
SOLDEED: It must be found!
SOLDEED: The Nimon will have to be informed.
DOCTOR: These engines have seen better days.
COPILOT: This is a battleship of the First Skonnon Empire. It will soon be replaced.
DOCTOR: Well, the sooner the better. It's a right hodge-podge up there. Very old engines patched up with new equipment, a lot of it not really compatible.
ROMANA: Sounds like the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Yes.
COPILOT: Can you make it work?
DOCTOR: The odd thing is, the new equipment seems to be the product of an entirely different technology.
COPILOT: Can you make it work?
DOCTOR: Have to noticed how people's intellectual curiosity declines sharply the moment they start waving guns about?
COPILOT: Can you make it work?
DOCTOR: Yes. Oh yes, I can make it work. The question is, can we generate power soon enough to take the ship to escape velocity before we fall into a black hole with an event horizon.
COPILOT: A what?
DOCTOR: Shush. You just hold the gun steady. Don't tax your mind.
ROMANA: Do you think we have enough power?
DOCTOR: Not with that fuel.
ROMANA: What about the hymetusite? If we could convert the engines, it's an immensely rich energy source.
DOCTOR: Brilliant! I wish I'd thought of that.
ROMANA: Oh, you will, Doctor, you will.
DOCTOR: Ha ha. Take a look.
DOCTOR: Now, I've got to go back to my own ship to get some things. I want you to fetch up two pieces of hymetusite to lower into the fuel cell. Look, why don't you give me the gun and then I can keep an eye on myself so that I don't get up to any funny business?
COPILOT: Don't you play the fool with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: All right. What do you think, Romana?
ROMANA: I think it's possible. You're right, though. It's a strange mixture of technologies up here.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Well, listen. As soon as he brings the hymetusite
ROMANA: I shall know what to do with it.
DOCTOR: Good girl, Romana. Now listen. I'm popping back to the Tardis to get some gear. Here, take this. You might need it.
ROMANA: Er, no thank you. I've made my own.
DOCTOR: Oh, really? Really? You made this? Not bad. Bit basic though. Huh. Thank you.
ROMANA: Er Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes? Oh. Ha, ha. So sorry.
ROMANA: Thank you. Look, don't we both want to get out of here?
DOCTOR: Now, be kind to them.
COPILOT: Weakling scum. You two, go on.
SOLDEED: In the name of the Second Skonnon Empire.
DOCTOR: K9?
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are. How's it going, K9?
K9: Damage report almost complete, master.
DOCTOR: And?
K9: Defence shields are inoperative.
DOCTOR: Well, I know that.
K9: Dematerialisation circuits inoperative.
DOCTOR: We're up a gum tree without a paddle.
K9: Define gum tree.
DOCTOR: Well, it's a tree that gives gum.
K9: Explain use of paddle in gum tree.
DOCTOR: You wouldn't understand, K9.
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: How's the dimensional stabiliser?
K9: Fused, master.
DOCTOR: Gravitic anomoliser?
K9: Functioning normally, master.
DOCTOR: Good, good. I'll take that, then, and one or two other bits and pieces. Oh, by the way, K9. Skonnon Empire. Does that mean anything to you?
K9: Skonnon Empire. Military dictatorship extended over one hundred star systems. Lost in civil war.
SOLDEED: Lord Nimon? Lord Nimon? It is I, Soldeed.
ROMANA: It's getting worse.
DOCTOR: We're almost there. Get back to the flight deck and switch on the engines.
COPILOT: Then what?
DOCTOR: Then you wait until I come and give you the signal to start building up power. Hurry! And don't forget to wait for the signal.
COPILOT: All right.
DOCTOR: Right, now as soon as he switches on the power, you know what to do.
ROMANA: Plug the gravitic anomoliser into the main circuit.
DOCTOR: Good girl.
ROMANA: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: I'm going to move the Tardis into the hold of this ship, then we can ride out with it, park somewhere and repair it with as much time as we like.
ROMANA: Is that safe?
DOCTOR: Well, it would be if the dimensional stabiliser was working. It's all right, it's all right. K9 said it's just fused.
DOCTOR: Hello. Have some more jelly babies.
ROMANA: It's going to be all right. We just have to wait for the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not that bit, K9, that bit.
DOCTOR: Ow!
K9: Apologies, master.
DOCTOR: What is it, K9?
K9: Gravity still increasing, master.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's just what I thought.
ROMANA: I don't see why.
SETH: Because if we don't send a tribute every year, Skonnos will come and destroy Aneth.
ROMANA: With ships like these?
SETH: The Skonnon battlefleet is an awesome sight.
ROMANA: Have you seen it?
TEKA: Our grandparents did, in the days of the first conquest. They say it blotted out the daylight.
ROMANA: Well, if the whole fleet's in this condition, a good shout would see the lot of them off.
ROMANA: What's that noise?
SETH: Must be the ship in flight.
ROMANA: In flight? But the Doctor isn't back on board yet. The pilot was meant to wait! Oh, why didn't you tell me we were moving?
DOCTOR: We've been abandoned, K9!
K9: Affirmative, master.
DOCTOR: The co-pilot.
ROMANA: Despicable worm! Turn back!
COPILOT: My duty is to get my cargo to the Nimon. We're late already.
ROMANA: Your duty is to save the life of the man who's just saved yours.
COPILOT: We must fulfil our part of the pact.
ROMANA: Turn back!
COPILOT: The Nimon waits for no man!
NIMON: You dare disturb me at this time?
DOCTOR: The weasel.
K9: Master.
DOCTOR: Poor Romana.
K9: Master!
DOCTOR: What is it, K9?
K9: Scanner detects large object approaching at great speed.
DOCTOR: Looks like an asteroid. What do you make of it?
K9: Estimated mass equivalent to two hundred and twenty million tons.
DOCTOR: Two hundred and twenty million tons? That's not an asteroid, that's a planet!
K9: Diameter nine six point four kilometres, approaching at a speed of mach nine point three.
DOCTOR: Nine point three? It's coming right for us!
Part Two
K9: Affirmative.
DOCTOR: Estimated time to impact?
K9: Master?
DOCTOR: How long have we got?
K9: Estimated time to impact
DOCTOR: That's what I said.
K9: Eighty nine point four seconds.
DOCTOR: Eighty nine point four seconds. No dematerialisation, no defence shields, and only half power on full drive. K9, I think we're going to find out what it's like to be a cricket ball. Well, it's been a great, great partnership, old girl.
K9: Master.
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, K9. This is no time for emotional quibbling, you two. You've been a good dog to me, K9.
DOCTOR: The best I ever had.
K9: Thank you, master.
DOCTOR: It's a pleasure.
K9: Time to impact now fifty eight seconds dead.
DOCTOR: I wish you wouldn't say things like that, K9. Fifty eight seconds dead. Did I say cricket ball?
COPILOT: The beacon! We've made it. We're back on course.
ROMANA: We must go back.
COPILOT: Get away from those controls!
ROMANA: We can't just leave the Doctor back there!
COPILOT: Get up! Get up. Into the hold. Move!
COPILOT: Your friend can rot in his black hole for all I care.
DOCTOR: Brace yourself, K9. This is it.
DOCTOR: K9? K9? Are you all right, K9?
K9:  Affirmative.
DOCTOR: How am I, K9?
K9: There appears to be no damage to your circuits.
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, good! Good, good. Well, let's hope the same is true of the Tardis. You're a good boy, K9.
DOCTOR: Ha ha! We did it!
K9: Please clarify.
DOCTOR: Well, I just put a lot of spin on the Tardis, and the asteroid simply sliced us up out of the gravity whirlpool. Oh, you know, K9, sometimes I think I'm wasted just rushing around the universe saving planets from destruction. With a talent like mine, I might have been a great slow bowler.
NIMON: You dare to speak to me of failure? Be mindful of the terms of the pact, Soldeed.
SOLDEED: I am, Lord Nimon.
NIMON: Be mindful of what you have undertaken to perform. The tributes must be brought before me.
SOLDEED: They will be, Lord Nimon.
NIMON: There can be no stumbling in the great journey of life.
SOLDEED: Indeed not, Lord Nimon. We shall trace the ship. It is just possible the Anethans have attacked her to rescue the prisoners.
NIMON: And what have you done to exact vengeance and reparation for such a deed?
SOLDEED: Nothing as yet, Lord Nimon. I came to you as soon as I heard the news.
NIMON: You are idle, Soldeed. Neglectful of your undertakings.
SOLDEED: No, Lord Nimon. We have very nearly fulfilled our half of the contract. The condition of our ships makes it difficult for us to attack Aneth. If you would advance us a little of that technology you have promised us, we could complete our agreement and claim reparation from Aneth for both of us.
NIMON: No, Soldeed. The terms of our agreement are very clear. You are buying from me the power to conquer a galaxy. I will be paid in full.
SOLDEED: But, Lord Nimon
NIMON: In full!
SORAK: Soldeed?
SOLDEED: I have spoken with the Nimon.
SORAK: And what does the Nimon say?
SOLDEED: He speaks of many things. He speaks of the great journey of life.
SORAK: Again? What does he mean by the great journey of life?
SOLDEED: Mean? It is, it is a metaphor.
SORAK: For what?
SOLDEED: He also speaks of a retribution he shall exact from you, Sorak, if you do not find that ship or get a fresh shipment of sacrifices from Aneth immediately. We must attack Aneth.
SORAK: But Soldeed.
SOLDEED: We must do it, Sorak.
ROMANA: With eight of us it should be possible to overpower him and take over the ship.
SETH: It would be no use.
ROMANA: Of course it would! I can fly the ship. We go back for the Doctor then we take you all home, back to Aneth and your families.
TEKA: No!
SETH: We must go to Skonnos for the sake of Aneth and our families.
TEKA: If we don't go, the Nimon will destroy Aneth. The only way we can be free and our people stop living in fear is to defeat the Nimon.
SETH: Quiet, Teka. No one must know.
ROMANA: No one must know what?
TEKA: Seth is going to destroy the Nimon and take us home in triumph! His father's keeping a lookout so that he can have a welcome party ready.
ROMANA: He might not be so optimistic if he could see this lot. Well, you can hang around. I'm going to find a way out.
SETH: What's the matter?
ROMANA: The sonic screwdriver. I must have left it behind.
SORAK: Soldeed.
SOLDEED: Well? Have you arranged for another ship to attack Aneth?
SORAK: No, sir. It's the lost ship. We've located it!
SOLDEED: What?
SORAK: It's reappeared on the scanners. We've just had a signal. Apparently they had some sort of accident. The captain was killed, but it's all right now. And they're due to dock in two hours.
SOLDEED: Prepare for the ceremony at once.
SORAK: Yes, sir.
SOLDEED: The great pact nears it's completion! The Nimon be praised! Skonnos shall rise and conquer!
ROMANA: So what is this Nimon?
TEKA: The great god of Skonnos. They say he's a terrible creature with awesome powers.
SETH: If we don't pay tribute, the Nimon will destroy us.
ROMANA: Sounds like an insecure personality to me.
SETH: He lives in the power complex.
ROMANA: That fits.
SETH: Anyone who enters never returns, except the one called Soldeed.
ROMANA: Soldeed?
SETH: Well, yes. The great scientist and engineer of Skonnos. It is he who built the complex for the Nimon.
TEKA: They say he's the only scientist left on Skonnos.
ROMANA: Really? Why is that?
SETH: The great Civil War. Only the army survived.
ROMANA: That sounds like a well-organised war.
SETH: It was then that the Nimon arrived.
ROMANA: And started demanding tributes?
TEKA: Yes, but Seth's going to change all that, aren't you.
SETH: Yes. Yes.
ROMANA: You seem to have taken on quite a task.
SETH: It is.
ROMANA: Well, you don't sound awfully confident about it. I thought you were meant to be the great hero of Aneth.
SETH: But I'm not. I don't want to be a hero. I've never wanted to be. It's just that I've chanced to be around when things have happened. I'm not even a prince. I'd run away from home. I was on the road. They found me, and rather than be sent back, I made up some story. The King believed it and, well, here I am.
ROMANA: You have got problems, haven't you.
SETH: Look, I just have to do what I can. Please, don't tell Teka.
ROMANA: Don't worry, Seth. Your secret is safe with me.
SETH: Promise?
ROMANA: Cross my heart. Both of them.
COPILOT: You! I need you to help me land the ship. We're nearly there. Through there.
COPILOT: Weakling scum!
DOCTOR: Right, K9. Without our gravitic anomoliser, this is the best we can do. Let's give it a try, shall we? Ah, come on, old girl.
DOCTOR: That's very odd. Wouldn't you say that was odd, K9?
K9: Odd not computable, master.
SORAK: I have the honour to present the tribute from Aneth.
SOLDEED: Why have they brought only five crystals? There are two missing. Where are they?
ROMANA: I can answer that.
SOLDEED: Who are you?
ROMANA: I'm Romana. Who are you?
SORAK: How dare you speak to the great Soldeed like that!
ROMANA: I have a complaint to make.
SOLDEED: What?
ROMANA: Yes, that pilot of yours
SOLDEED: Who are you?
ROMANA: I've told you. Now where's the Doctor?
SOLDEED: Doctor? What doctor?
ROMANA: The one that creature left behind.
SOLDEED: Who is this woman and where does she come from?
ROMANA: I come from Gallifrey, if that means anything to you.
SOLDEED: If you speak again, I shall have you eliminated on the spot. Now you, tell me.
COPILOT: She's a space pirate, sir. She and her companions attacked our ship. They killed the captain but I managed to drive them off.
SOLDEED: Go on.
COPILOT: I captured this one, sir, at great personal risk.
SOLDEED: Yes, I'm sure.
COPILOT: Unfortunately, our engines had been damaged in their attack and I had to repair them.
ROMANA: That's a lie. We crashed into his ship, but it had already stopped and the captain was already dead.
SOLDEED: Silence. You have been warned.  How did you repair the damage?
COPILOT: I had to adapt the engines to use hymeTUsite, sir.
SOLDEED: HyMETusite.
COPILOT: HyMETusite. That's where the other two crystals went.
SOLDEED: You had to adapt the engines?
COPILOT: Yes, sir, or we'd never have got home at all. And I thought five crystals were better than none. And then there were the Anethans.
SOLDEED: Exactly how did you adapt those engines?
COPILOT: Well, sir. 
SOLDEED: Go on.
COPILOT: The fuel cells, sir. I modified the fuel cells.
SOLDEED: You are a liar.
COPILOT: No, sir. Truly.
SOLDEED: You wouldn't have the skill or the intelligence to adapt those engines in a million years. You deviated from the set course, didn't you. Didn't you?
COPILOT: It was a computer malfunction, sir.
SOLDEED: Your story alters by the second. You endangered the tribute to the Nimon.
COPILOT: It was a computer malfunction, sir!
SOLDEED: You know the penalty.
COPILOT: No, sir!
SOLDEED: The Nimon shall deal with you.
COPILOT: But sir!
SOLDEED: Into the complex!
SOLDEED: In the name of the Second Skonnon Empire!
SOLDEED: And now, the rest of them. Including her.
DOCTOR: Right, here we go again. After five, four, three, two, one.  Come on.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! Success at last, right, K9? Let's try and find our way to Skonnos and recover our gravitic anomoliser.
K9: Ahem. Master?
DOCTOR: And Romana. Don't forget Romana. Tut, tut, tut.
SOLDEED: The final tribute at this very moment, gentlemen, is being paid to the Nimon!
ALL: The Nimon!
SOLDEED: I think you all appreciate the irony that in providing these tributes for us, the planet Aneth has given us the power with which we shall reconquer them and from there go on to build the Second Skonnos Empire!
Even now our factories await the secrets the Nimon shall unfold to us. Secrets that will give Skonnos the most powerful fleet of ships this galaxy has seen. The galaxy shall shudder at the name of Skonnos!
ALL: Skonnos!
SOLDEED: Our fire shall infest their heavens. It shall be the greatest empire the galaxy has seen. An empire of fire, steel and blood! Skonnos shall rule!
TEKA: What was that?
SETH: Must be the Nimon.
ROMANA: He doesn't sound very happy, does he.
SETH: I wonder where he is? All these corridors look the same.
ROMANA: Don't worry. I have a feeling if we don't find him, he'll find us.
SETH: That's what I'm worried about.
TEKA: How can you joke about it?
ROMANA: Come on.
SETH: But, there was a wall here.
ROMANA: Yes.
DOCTOR: There we are. Hello, that looks interesting. Reminds me of something. Yes, I think we'll take a look in there to start with.
K9: Sensors detect hemispherical defence shield.
DOCTOR: Why should that be, I wonder, K9?
K9: Strength, seven thousand three hundred megazones.
DOCTOR: Yes, just as I thought. Oh well, never mind. We'll just have to land somewhere near it. Somewhere unobtrusive.
DOCTOR: Ah, good morning. Or is it evening here? Lovely day, isn't it? Wasn't it? No?
DOCTOR: Oh no, not again. How is it wherever I go in the universe there are always people like you pointing guns or phasers or blasters? Now don't do anything hasty. It's just a flying visit. Take me to your leader.
SETH: What is it?
TEKA: Is it dead?
ROMANA: Yes. It's as though something has sucked the life force out of it and left just a husk.
TEKA: That's what's going to happen to us, isn't it? It isn't just the hymetusite that's the tribute, it's us as well.
TEKA: The Nimon did this, didn't he? Seth will kill him.
SETH: If he can be destroyed.
TEKA: You'll destroy him.
ROMANA: He'll be waiting for us somewhere.
SOLDEED: What is this?
DOCTOR: Ah, hello. I'm the Doctor.
SOLDEED: The Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. I just dropped in.
SOLDEED: Dropped in?
DOCTOR: Mmm. You must be Soldeed.
SOLDEED: I am.
DOCTOR: I thought so.
SOLDEED: Release him.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I say, that looks interesting. Very interesting.
DOCTOR: Having a little trouble with the neutrino converter?
SOLDEED: Neutrino converter?
DOCTOR: Neutrino converter.
SOLDEED: What do you know about such matters?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've seen similar things here and there.
SOLDEED: Oh, come now, Doctor. This is my invention.
DOCTOR: How very odd, how very extraordinary, then, you don't know what a neutrino conversion is. Did you know that someone's building a black hole on your doorstep?
SOLDEED: What?
DOCTOR: Yes. I got stuck in it, along with one of your spacecraft.
SOLDEED: Digging a black hole on my doorstep.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. A good thing I got stuck in it, too, otherwise your ship would still have been there.
SOLDEED: So it was you that rescued my ship?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, with a little help from my friend. Nice girl. I don't suppose you've seen her, have you? Blonde, about so big, always sticking her nose in things that don't concern her.
SOLDEED: No. Why should I have seen her?
DOCTOR: I just thought she was heading this way.
SOLDEED: I haven't any idea what you're talking about.
SORAK: Soldeed, I searched that ship as you ordered, and I found this.
SOLDEED: Oh.
DOCTOR: Oh, no idea what I'm talking about? How do you explain that, Soldeed?
SOLDEED: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's my gravitic anomoliser from my Tardis.  Now, where's Romana?
SOLDEED: Out of harms way, where you should be, you meddling fool.
SOLDEED: After him, you fools, you dolts!
DOCTOR: Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I'd like to say one thing and let me make it perfectly clear, I stand before you desperate to find the exit. Can anybody help me?
SOLDEED: Doctor, in the name of the Second Skonnon Empire
SORAK: He went into the Complex.
SOLDEED: But of course. All according to plan. The Nimon will take care of him. Ha ha. Goodbye, Doctor. Bwahahahaha!
SETH: Are they dead?
ROMANA: No. They seem to be in some sort of suspended animation. This must be the Nimon's deep freeze.
TEKA: What's that?
ROMANA: Well, by the look of that poor husk in there, I'd guess that the Nimon feeds by ingesting the binding energy of organic compounds such as flesh. This must be his storeroom, his larder. This poor thing must be waiting her turn.
TEKA: That's horrible!
SETH: Look, what are we going to do?
ROMANA: Well, there's no point hanging around here. Let's see if we can find a way out.
COPILOT: Oh no you don't. Stay where you are.
ROMANA: And what are you doing? We're in this together, you know.
COPILOT: You may be, but I'm going to get out of here. Now, get through there. I want you all together.
COPILOT: Nimon! Nimon! They're here! I've brought you the tribute from Aneth!
NIMON: Who dares call the Nimon?
COPILOT: Er, it, it's me, I do, sir. I've brought you the latest sacrifices.
NIMON: I need no one to bring the sacrifices to me.
COPILOT: They were very rebellious, sir. I brought them all the way from Aneth. They were trouble, sir. Soldeed thought
NIMON: He did not send you to bring me sacrifices. He sent you to be executed.
COPILOT: No, really!
NIMON: You are a liar and a coward.
NIMON: You shall die.
COPILOT: Mercy, Lord Nimon. I brought you the tribute!
Part Three
DOCTOR: Hello, is this a private party?
DOCTOR: Or can anyone join in? So you're the mighty Nimon, eh?
DOCTOR: Tell me, Nimon. Tell me, are you really terribly fierce. Hmm? Is it true that you're very, very, very fierce?
ROMANA: Get out, everybody!
ROMANA: Go! Go!
NIMON: The fools. Did they think they could change the course of the great journey of life like this? These can be replaced very simply. The programme will continue. So, you bring me a mere five crystals? It will suffice.
ROMANA: Doctor? Doctor?
TEKA: Perhaps he went a different way with the others.
SETH: Perhaps the Nimon got him.
ROMANA: Thank you for that thought. The Doctor will make for the Tardis. Let's find the way out.
SORAK: Have you any idea where it came from?
SOLDEED: It is very strange. It has the external appearance of something from a fairly primitive society, and yet quite obviously it is some form of travel space capsule.
SORAK: If we could dismantle it, strip it down.
SOLDEED: No, Sorak, no. It may be a booby-trap. You can never tell with mysterious contraptions such as this.
SETH: Oh, dead end!
TEKA: We'll never find our way out, even if there is one.
ROMANA: There must be. Soldeed can come and go.
TEKA: Won't be long before the Nimon finds us and kills us.
SETH: He's coming. Give me the blaster, quick!
ROMANA: It's no use. It had no effect on the Nimon.
DOCTOR: Hello. What are you doing skulking down here.
TEKA: It's a dead end.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course, yes.
ROMANA: What about the way you've just come?
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't know. You call this a maze? It's a cheat!
ROMANA: Shush!
DOCTOR: Well, the walls keep changing.
ROMANA: There must be some sort of
DOCTOR: Just a minute. I saw this place from above just before I landed. It reminded me of something.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: I can't think what.
TEKA: If the Nimon comes along, we're trapped.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. He'll be too busy repairing his furnace.
SETH: Furnace?
TEKA: What's that for, burning the bodies?
DOCTOR: No, no, he has another use for those altogether.
ROMANA: Sustenance.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SETH: What's the furnace for, then?
DOCTOR: Looked like a nuclear reactor to me.
ROMANA: Fuelled by your crystals.
DOCTOR: Yes, your tribute had a very practical purpose. I think there's something horribly evil going on here. Let's go, shall we? Where are the others? Well?
ROMANA: They're with the Nimon.
DOCTOR: What! Come on. Come on!
NIMON: You may approach with your tribute. Come. You do not wish me to destroy Aneth.
DOCTOR: It's this way, I think.
ROMANA: Oh, surely not.
DOCTOR: Why not?
ROMANA: That must lead deeper into the complex.
DOCTOR: That's right.
SETH: We'll never get out that way.
DOCTOR: Well, of course not. Whatever gave you that idea?
SETH: What idea?
DOCTOR: That I was trying to find a way out. Oh no, we've got to go deeper into the complex.
ROMANA: We've got to find the others.
DOCTOR: Right. Come on, this way.
DOCTOR: Maybe it's this way.
NIMON: We have achieved operational power level. The next step in the great journey of life will soon be accomplished.
DOCTOR: Ah ha! This is more like it.
ROMANA: Doctor, look at this.
DOCTOR: Just as I thought.
ROMANA: It's quite a powerhouse, isn't it.
DOCTOR: It certainly is. What do you make of it?
ROMANA: Well, it seems to be some form of transmitter.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, with the horns on the top as the antennae.
ROMANA: But transmitting what?
DOCTOR: Energy.
ROMANA: Of course! That would account for the hymetusite in the nuclear furnace. It's immensely powerful. An amazing bit of engineering.
DOCTOR: Yes, but for what purpose?
ROMANA: Only the Nimon knows that.
DOCTOR: Yes. I think it's about time someone else found out.
DOCTOR: Give me that.
DOCTOR: Seth and Teka, come here. Take that. I want you to guard the door and look out for the Nimon, hmm?
SETH: Right. What do we do if he comes?
DOCTOR: Tell me and then run, in that order.
SETH: Right-o.
TEKA: Don't worry, Doctor. If the Nimon comes, Seth will deal with him.
SETH : Teka, come on!
DOCTOR: Got it!
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: Now I know what this place reminded me of when I saw it from the Tardis.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: A giant positronic circuit.
ROMANA: Of course.
DOCTOR: And the reason why the walls keep changing is when the circuit's in operation
ROMANA: They keep switching.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
ROMANA: But why? We still don't know what it's transmitting or where to.
DOCTOR: Need a computer to find that out.
ROMANA: K9?
DOCTOR: Got it! K9.
ROMANA: But will he be able to find us?
DOCTOR: Certainly, certainly. Well, I should think so. I mean, he could follow our psychospores, couldn't he?
K9: Master.
SOLDEED: It is very strange. It resists everything. It is totally impossible to open.
SORAK: You did it!
SOLDEED: Yes.
SORAK: Look out!
K9: Master?
SORAK: What is it?
SOLDEED: Some kind of machine.
SORAK: It's alive! Stop it.
SOLDEED: As I thought. Some form of electronic device. Go and see if there are any more inside that mysterious contraption.
SORAK: The door appears to be closed again, Soldeed.
SOLDEED: Very well. Leave the guards to watch that, and bring this machine to my to my laboratory and have it guarded.
DOCTOR: Got it! No, I haven't.
ROMANA: I've never seen anything quite like this before.
DOCTOR: No. I thought for a moment it was a giant transmat.
ROMANA: No transmat pad.
DOCTOR: That's right. It's a direction beam of some kind, though.
ROMANA: Hmm. It seems to be pumping out energy over vast distances.
DOCTOR: Yes. Wait a minute. That's some kind of bearing. Of course! It's focused on the black hole.
ROMANA: Our black hole?
DOCTOR: Well, we said it was artificially created.
ROMANA: From here?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: But why? What good is a black hole to anyone?
DOCTOR: It could be a gateway towards hyperspace.
ROMANA: With an exit somewhere else.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: Where?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I'll tell you something interesting. When I mentioned the black hole to Soldeed, he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.
ROMANA: Ah, well, people often don't know what you're talking about.
DOCTOR: Exactly. If Soldeed doesn't know about the black hole, what does he think all this if for?
SOLDEED: Power, drawn from the distant stars themselves, to power the new generation of Skonnon ship with which we shall conquer these stars! This is what the Nimon gives us.
ALL: Hail Nimon!
SOLDEED: Each of you shall command your own fleet and I, Soldeed, shall lead you into battle.
ALL: Soldeed!
SOLDEED: Skonnos shall rule the heavens!
ALL: Skonnos!
SOLDEED: Go now, and await your orders.
ALL: Skonnos.
SOLDEED: To the Second Empire.
SORAK: Soldeed, it sometimes occurs to me to wonder exactly why the Nimon is doing this for us. I mean, to be blunt, what's in it for him?
SOLDEED: Sorak, you dare to question?
SORAK: Well, to speculate, Soldeed. Not to question, merely to speculate.
SOLDEED: Sorak, you must understand the Nimon. The Nimon is as a god to us. It pleases him to be godlike, to receive tribute and to grant us power. We want that power, so we give him the tribute he asks, or rather, we get Aneth to do it for us.
SORAK: Something for nothing, in fact. That always makes me feel uneasy.
SOLDEED: Sorak, you are too scrupulous. You get what you want by giving people what they want. If there happens to be a little imbalance, make sure it's in your favour. The Nimon is simple. Powerful, brutal, yes, Scientifically advanced, yes, but simple in his desires. I fawn to him a little. That satisfies his bestial ego and he gives us what I ask. I play the Nimon on a long string.
TEKA: What was that? I think I heard something.
SETH: No. No, I didn't hear anything.
TEKA: Seth, what are we going to do?
SETH: I'll think of something.
TEKA: You'll get us out of this, won't you?
SETH: If I can think of a way.
TEKA: Listen. That was something. It's coming this way.
SETH: Go and warn the Doctor. Go and warn the Doctor now!
TEKA: Aren't you going to fight the Nimon?
SETH: Yes, but not now. Go on!
DOCTOR: Come on, K9.
TEKA: Doctor, there's something coming.
DOCTOR: That was quick. Good old K9.
TEKA: No, I think it's the Nimon.
ROMANA: Come on, let's get out of here.
SETH: It's too late. It's coming.
DOCTOR: Quick, come on. Hide! Hide!
ROMANA: Doctor, don't.
DOCTOR: I want to find out what he's doing.
ROMANA: Well? What is he doing?
DOCTOR: I don't know what he's doing. Whatever it is he's doing, I think we're too late to stop him doing it.
SOLDEED: So you see, Sorak, I have used the Anethans, I have used the Nimon, and I'd use this creature too if I knew how the infernal thing worked. There is power in this, Sorak. Power. It is a monumental piece of electronic engineering.
SORAK: But surely, Soldeed, with your skills?
SOLDEED: My skills, yes.
SORAK: Soldeed, look! The complex.
SOLDEED: Sorak, the time has come. From this moment, mark the beginning of the Second Skonnon Empire. With that power, let the onslaught begin!
SOLDEED: Calm yourselves, you craven fools. I shall speak to the Nimon.
SORAK: Take care, Soldeed.
SOLDEED: Sorak, you know I have nothing to fear. In the name of the Second Skonnon Empire!
ROMANA: Look!
DOCTOR: What?
TEKA: What's happening?
SETH: I don't know.
TEKA: Why don't you know?
SETH: I don't know.
NIMON: Welcome to Skonnos, my friends. Welcome to the new home of the Nimon race, the next step in the great journey of life.
NIMON 2: You have done well, but you're only just in time. Crinoth is finished.
NIMON: Now that you're here, come. We can begin the migration with all speed.
ROMANA: It's a space capsule.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SETH: I don't understand. There's no engines.
DOCTOR: It wouldn't need engines, would it, Romana.
ROMANA: The energy beam. The black hole.
DOCTOR: Two black holes. One at the beginning of the journey, one at the end, and a hyperspatial tunnel in between.
ROMANA: And that beam providing the motive power.
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEKA: I don't understand.
ROMANA: The Nimons have found a way of leaping across the universe as far as they want, instantaneously.
DOCTOR: That's right.
TEKA: I thought there was only one Nimon.
DOCTOR: So did Soldeed. They've been terribly clever. Fiendishly clever.
TEKA: Seth, what's happening?
DOCTOR: Invasion.
SETH: Invasion.
DOCTOR: Yes, it happens all the time. When a race runs out of space or destroys its home, it has to find somewhere else to live.
SETH: Skonnos?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SETH: But it's already inhabited.
DOCTOR: Yes.
TEKA: Then how many more are coming?
DOCTOR: Well
ROMANA: To make all this worthwhile, there must be thousands.
DOCTOR: Millions.
TEKA: What, two at a time?
DOCTOR: Well, as more arrive, they'll build more transmats and increase exponentially. You don't imagine this is the only planet that's been tricked, do you? We've got to stop them.
SETH: How?
DOCTOR: Seth and Teka
SETH: On guard again.
DOCTOR: Right.
DOCTOR: We're going to have to be very clever. Power on this scale could blow the whole planet to bits if I touch the wrong thing. Romana?
ROMANA: Yes?
DOCTOR: I want to know everything about that capsule.
ROMANA: Everything?
DOCTOR: Everything.
ROMANA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's all right.
ROMANA: Oh, I wish you wouldn't do that.
DOCTOR: I think I've found the main power control.
ROMANA: Really?
DOCTOR: Yes. If I can reverse the flow, the energy will go back to where the space-time tunnel begins.
ROMANA: Crinoth.
DOCTOR: Yes. I might even be able to send the Nimons back again.
ROMANA: Brilliant.
SOLDEED: Lord Nimon? Lord Nimon? It is I, Soldeed.
SOLDEED : Lord Nimon?
SETH: Listen.
SOLDEED : Lord Nimon, are you there?
SETH: Come on.
SETH: Doctor, there's someone coming.
DOCTOR: There, that should do it.
SETH: I said there's someone coming!
DOCTOR: I said that should do it.
DOCTOR: Come on. Ah ha. Romana? You're
SETH: Where is she?
DOCTOR: She must have been inside the capsule.
TEKA: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Well, I'll have to switch the whole thing back. Let's hope we've got time.
SOLDEED: You, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's all right, I can explain everything.
SOLDEED: Leave that alone!
DOCTOR: No, well, you see what happens is
DOCTOR: Romana.
SOLDEED: You meddling fool. You shall die.
Part Four
DOCTOR: Seth, well done!
SETH: Is he dead?
DOCTOR: No, just knocked out. Right, now let's see what the damage is. Oh, I don't like the look of that. Sorry, Romana.
ROMANA: Doctor, I. Doctor? Doctor, where are you?
NIMON 3: You.
NIMON 3: Stop! Pursue her.
SETH: Is it very bad?
DOCTOR: It's very bad. I might just be able to fix it if I can cannibalise one of the other circuits.
SETH: Is there anything I can do?
DOCTOR: No, no. You've done enough. It's K9 I need now.
DOCTOR: Oh, my gravitic anomoliser.
SETH: Will it help?
DOCTOR: It might help. You see, it's an entirely different system but it just might be compatible.
TEKA: Will it work?
DOCTOR: Well, if it's compatible it'll work better than the original. On the other hand, if it's not compatible
SETH: What?
DOCTOR: There'll be a bang so big you won't even hear it.
TEKA: Oh, Doctor, look!
SOLDEED : Bwhahahahahaha!
DOCTOR: He'll warn the Nimon. Quick, after him!
SETH: Come on!
SETH: Down there, come on.
ROMANA: Who are you?
SEZOM: I am Sezom.
ROMANA: You just saved my life. Are they dead?
SEZOM: Alas, no, but they will be unconscious for a while. Who are you? Why are you here?
ROMANA: I'm Romana. I'm here by accident. Where are we?
SEZOM: This is Crinoth, what's left of it.
ROMANA: Why, what happened?
SEZOM: The Nimons happened. They have destroyed everything, everyone. Everyone but me.
ROMANA: Are you all right? You look awful.
SEZOM: My time is almost up.
ROMANA: Here, sit down.
SEZOM: Thank you.
ROMANA: There, how's that?
SEZOM: Better. You're very kind.
ROMANA: You did just save my life.
SEZOM: But I have caused the deaths of so many others. The total destruction of our planet and all its people. I am to blame.
ROMANA: Why? What did you do?
SEZOM: I allowed the Nimons to come here. I worked for them, became their creature. They promised us technology, peace, prosperity. It
ROMANA: Go on.
SEZOM: It seemed so easy. Such a small price.
ROMANA: Did you have to provide them with some sort of tribute?
SEZOM: How did you know that?
ROMANA: I've seen something similar.
SEZOM: There was only one of them to start with. I never knew what was to come. I swear, I never knew what was to come. It seemed such a small price to pay.
ROMANA: It always does.
SETH: You stay here. I'll check.
SETH: Yes, come on. It's this way. Teka. Teka?
SETH: Teka!
TEKA: Seth? Seth!
DOCTOR: Ah.
SORAK: So you have power, do you? Power that even Soldeed cannot understand.
SEZOM: They're like a plague of locusts. They seem harmless enough
ROMANA: Till they start to swarm.
SEZOM: Yes, from planet to planet, sucking each one dry then moving on to another and another and another. Their numbers are multiplying.
ROMANA: I've got to get back to Skonnos.
SEZOM: Where's Skonnos?
ROMANA: It's their next victim planet. I've just come from there.
SEZOM: Then you must get back and warn them.
ROMANA: It could be easier said than done. Can you help me get back to the capsule.
SEZOM: I will try.
SETH: Teka! Where are you?
DOCTOR: Welcome back, Romana.
DOCTOR: Oh, my prophetic soul!
NIMON 6: This is Crinoth.
NIMON 7: We have not moved. Stay.
K9: What is this place?
SORAK: It's. You can speak.
K9: Affirmative. What is this place?
SORAK: It's Soldeed's laboratory.
K9: What am I doing here?
SORAK: Soldeed brought you here.
K9: Kindly remove me from this surface.
SORAK: First, give me a demonstration of your power.
K9: That was merely a warning. Kindly remove me from this surface.
SORAK: Wait a minute!
NIMON 7: Something has gone wrong on Skonnos.
NIMON 8: The way is blocked?
NIMON 9: Prepare the final contingency plan.
NIMON 8: That is too dangerous. There are too many of us still on this planet. If it explodes too soon
NIMON 9: We have no choice. The great journey of life must continue.
ROMANA: What do they mean, final contingency plan?
SEZOM: There is no energy left here. They rely on the power plant on the next planet to pull them through.
ROMANA: So if anything goes wrong there
SEZOM: The only way they can escape is to convert the matter of this planet itself into energy.
ROMANA: Can they do that?
SEZOM: Yes, but it's a chain reaction. Once it starts, there's no way of stopping it, and the whole planet will explode.
ROMANA: After they've gone, presumably. Poor Crinoth.
SEZOM: I wonder what's gone wrong on Skonnos?
ROMANA: Don't worry about that. If I know anything about the one who caused it, he'll find a way of undoing it.
SEZOM: Then you'll be able to get back and warn them?
ROMANA: Well, first I have to get back to the capsule. How are we going to deal with the Nimons?
SEZOM: I have my staff.
ROMANA: Can you kill them with that?
SEZOM: No, I can only stun them.
ROMANA: And they let you keep it?
SEZOM: It couldn't do them any harm when they gave it to me, but they overlooked the fact that I might be clever enough to modify it.)
SEZOM: I discovered that Jasonite increased the power considerably.
ROMANA: Jasonite?
SEZOM: It's a type of rock which carries a powerful electromagnetic charge. I've been experimenting with possible uses for it for years.)
SEZOM: I even tried to get the Nimons to help, but they weren't interested.
ROMANA: Can I have this?
SEZOM: Yes, of course.
ROMANA: How are we going to get past them?
SEZOM: Subterfuge.
SEZOM: Wait.
SEZOM: Right.
SEZOM: Alarm! Alarm! Crinoth is being invaded!
SEZOM: The complex is in danger!
SEZOM: Well done. Now quickly, into the capsule.
ROMANA: Sezom!
SEZOM: I, I'm done for.
ROMANA: Come with me.
SEZOM: No, it's too late for me.
ROMANA: Listen. More Nimons.
SEZOM: Hurry then, hurry.
ROMANA: I can't leave you!
SEZOM Get into the capsule. It's your only chance. Give me my staff. I'll try to hold them off as long as I can. Hurry now.
ROMANA: Thank you, Sezom.
SEZOM: Go! Go and warn Skonnos and the rest of the universe!
ROMANA: Come on, Doctor. Come on!
NIMON: Leave those controls.
DOCTOR: Ah, hello there. I was just
NIMON: Stand aside.
NIMON 2: Kill him. But not yet. We need to know who he is and what he is doing here.
DOCTOR: Well, really, I was just standing admiring the view.
NIMON 2: Silence. Later you will be questioned, tortured and killed.
DOCTOR: Well I hope you get it in the right order.
ROMANA: Come on, Doctor! Come on!
NIMON 6: There is an alien creature inside the capsule.
NIMON 7: Very well, prepare to blast it open.
NIMON: He has reversed the flow of the tunnel.
DOCTOR: Yes, you see, well, that's what I was trying to explain. When I
NIMON 2: Silence, Skonnon. Did you imagine you could you could prevent the great journey of life?
DOCTOR: No, but what I thought was
NIMON 2: Switch it back.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
ROMANA: Doctor, I don't know what you think you're playing at, but. Oh! Help.
NIMON 2: Another of the creature. Kill her!
SETH: Doctor, I've lost Teka.
ROMANA: Seth, catch!
SETH: What?
ROMANA; Jam it between the prongs.
SETH: Ah.
ROMANA: Now shoot it!
SETH: What?
ROMANA: Shoot!
SETH: What's going on?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Seth.
ROMANA: The invasion's started from Crinoth. Doctor, switch it back.
DOCTOR: I'll do better than that. I'll lock it off for good. Romana?
ROMANA: Yes.
DOCTOR: I think we're going to be all right.
ROMANA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: K9!
K9: Master.
DOCTOR: Well, you took your time getting here. Never mind, now you're here you can make yourself useful.
SETH: What is it?
DOCTOR: What do you mean, what is it? It's my dog.
SETH: Oh.
DOCTOR: He's called K9. K9? I want to modify the controls. I want to divert the space-time tunnel and send the Nimons back into the middle of nowhere. What do you think?
K9: Affirmative, master.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
SETH: What about Teka?
DOCTOR: Well, if the Nimons got her, she'll be in the larder.
SETH: Larder?
ROMANA: The room with the nuclear furnace.
DOCTOR: I'll meet you both there. Go on, off you go.
ROMANA: Right. Come on, Seth.
DOCTOR: K9, this is going to be a bit sticky.
SETH: Teka!
SOLDEED: You, you meddlesome hussy. Do not touch the sacrifices!
ROMANA: It's all over, Soldeed. You're finished.
SOLDEED: No, the Nimon will fulfil his great promise! The Nimon be praised!
ROMANA: The Nimon be praised? How many Nimons have you seen today?
SOLDEED: Don't dare blaspheme the Nimon.
ROMANA: How many!
SOLDEED: Skonnos will
ROMANA: How many Nimons?
SOLDEED: Three. I have seen three.
ROMANA: Well, I've just seen a whole lot more rampaging down the corridor. Face it, Soldeed, you're being invaded.
SOLDEED: He said he was the only one. The last survivor of his race.
ROMANA: He told you what you wanted to hear, promised you what you wanted to have.
SOLDEED: So this is the great journey of life?
ROMANA: They're parasitic nomads who've been feeding off your selfishness and gullibility.
SOLDEED: My dreams of conquest. You have brought this calamity upon me!
ROMANA: You've brought it on yourself!
SOLDEED: You will die for your interference!
ROMANA: Stop him!
SOLDEED: You fools. You are all doomed. Doomed.
SETH: Teka!
ROMANA: Get the others out of here.
SETH: But they're dead!
DOCTOR: No, they're not, they're just paralysed. K9, get them out quickly.
K9: Master.
ROMANA: The controls, they're jammed. It's gone critical. It's turned into a bomb and there's nothing we can do about it.
TEKA: I knew you'd save me, Seth. I knew it.
DOCTOR: Well, you're not saved yet. Come on, let's get out of here before the whole place explodes. Come on!
DOCTOR: Halt. Shush.
TEKA: You defeated the Nimon, Seth.
SETH: Not entirely.
TEKA: I knew you would. Now you'll get us out of this maze, won't you?
SETH: Doctor, how are we going to get out of this place if no one else has ever managed it before?
DOCTOR: Ah, but they didn't have a brilliant tracker dog like K9, did they. He can follow the scent all the way to the exit. Come on, K9. Come on.
NIMON: Pursue them!
DOCTOR: What is it, K9?
K9: Configuration has changed. It will be necessary for me to compute a suitable route as we proceed.
DOCTOR: What? Come on, K9. You can do it.
NIMON: Pursue them!
MAN: There he is.
SORAK: What is going on here?
MAN: We don't know.
K9: This is the exit, master.
DOCTOR: What? But it can't be. Try pointing the staff.
SETH: Nothing.
DOCTOR: In the name of the Second Skonnon Empire!
SETH: Nothing.
TEKA: We're trapped.
DOCTOR: K9, what do you make of that wall in front of you?
K9: Question not understood.
DOCTOR: There! There in front of you.
K9: That is the exit, master.
DOCTOR: No, no, the wall.
ROMANA: Come on, Doctor. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Shush. Just a minute. K9, is that a wall in front of us?
K9: Negative, master.
DOCTOR: Then off you go, then.
DOCTOR: Ah, a very clever illusion. Quick, everybody through. Quick! Quick!
SORAK: This is not possible! Where is Soldeed?
SETH: Soldeed's dead.
TEKA: And the Nimons are finished. Seth defeated them. I knew he would. He's the hero of Aneth.
SETH: Teka, please.
ROMANA: Get away, everybody. Get away!
DOCTOR: Everybody take cover. The whole place is about to explode!
ROMANA: Oh, no, not again.
DOCTOR: Well, I never finished the modifications to the conceptual geometer.
ROMANA: Immobilised again?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, what could possibly go wrong out here?
ROMANA: You said that once before, remember?
DOCTOR: I've said it hundreds of times before.
ROMANA: And how may times have you been right?
DOCTOR: Oh, four or three.
ROMANA: What do you think Skonnos will be like with Sorak in charge?
DOCTOR: Oh, not much better. Nasty race of people. Still, they're too busy fending for themselves to bother anyone else now.
ROMANA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
ROMANA: Look.
DOCTOR: Crinoth.
ROMANA: And the end of the Nimons.
DOCTOR: Good job, too.
ROMANA: I hope Seth and Teka and the others get back to Aneth safely.
DOCTOR: I should hope so. I made Sorak give them a ship.
ROMANA: Look, there they are.
DOCTOR: Poor old Seth.
ROMANA: Poor old Seth?
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, just imagine the legends Teka's going to build up around him. He'll have to spend the rest of his life trying to live up to them. It's terrible.
ROMANA: I suppose that's how legends are made.
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm glad this time I reminded them to paint their ship white. The last time anything like this happened, I completely forgot. Caused quite a hoo-ha.
ROMANA: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, other times, other places. Well, come on, old girl. There's quite few millennia left in you yet.
ROMANA: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not you, the Tardis.
