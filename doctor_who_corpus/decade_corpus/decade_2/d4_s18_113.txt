Warrior's Gate
Part One
SAGAN : Eighty. Seventy.
SAGAN : Sixty. Fifty. Forty.
SAGAN : Thirty, twenty nine, twenty eight, twenty seven, twenty six.
SAGAN : Twenty five, twenty four, twenty three, twenty two, twenty one, twenty.
SAGAN : Nineteen, eighteen, seventeen, sixteen, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
RORVIK: Hit it! Hit it!
PACKARD: How can I hit it? He's still not visualising.
RORVIK: Well, jump them.
PACKARD: What, the timelines? You can't do it blind.
RORVIK: I'll say what we can and can't do. Oh, anything's better than staying here. Ignition!
SAGAN: We have lift off.
RORVIK: Now we'll have to see, Biroc. Show us where we're going.
RORVIK: Right. High-tension cable. We'll run it to his feed point. That ought to boost him.
PACKARD: Kill him, more like.
RORVIK: Always looking on the gloomy side, Packard.
ALDO: He'll kill him.
ROYCE: You want to bet?
RORVIK: Connect the cable and switch on. 
SAGAN: We're closing on something.
ALDO: All right, it's fifty fifty. Okay.
PACKARD: He's right! We're heading for a time rift!
ROMANA: One more go.
DOCTOR: Haven't you done enough damage already?
ROMANA: It's not me, it's a time rift. She won't respond to the coordinates.
DOCTOR: Here, let me have a try. Just needs a little friendly persuasion, that's all. 
ROMANA: I have been friendly!
DOCTOR: Probably too friendly. I said a little friendly. Firm but friendly. Watch.
The juddering stops.)
DOCTOR: There.
DOCTOR: It's jammed. I've lost control. We're adrift in E-space.
ROMANA: Come on, Doctor. We've got to do something.
DOCTOR: Have we?
ROMANA: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Maybe that's it.
ROMANA: What, drifting? 
DOCTOR: The way out of E-space.
SAGAN: Helm readings show no space, no time, just like before.
RORVIK: Damn you, Biroc. Right back where we started. Stuck in this nothing for months and months and now this.
PACKARD: We've got damage!
RORVIK: Well, of course we've got damage! How bad?
SAGAN: Lane's taking a look.
LANE : Lane to Bridge.
PACKARD: What's the news?
LANE : The outer shell's torn. A rip you can climb right through. In fact, I just did.
PACKARD: Never mind the frills. What about the hull?
LANE : I'm checking that. Nothing structural that I can see.
LANE: The electrics are falling apart though. Tsk, dear oh dear. Ow.
RORVIK: Lane, will you stop fooling around and give me a proper report. Lane!
PACKARD: What about the warp drive?
RORVIK: Packard's worried about the warp drive.
LANE : If this power line goes up, there won't be any warp drive.
ROMANA: Go on, then, admit it. You don't know what your doing.
DOCTOR: I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just following intuition.
ROMANA: It's no better than tossing a coin.
DOCTOR: What's so improbable about tossing a coin? Never heard of the I-Ching?
ROMANA: Superstition.
DOCTOR: Random samplings that affect the broad flow of the material universe.
ROMANA: The holistic view?
DOCTOR: The holistic view.
ROMANA: Huh. Astral Jung.
ADRIC: What's the I-Ching?
K9: Ancient Chinese book of philosophy accessed by random sampling.
ADRIC: So how does that work then?
K9: One traditional method is tossing of coins. The I-Ching methodology casts doubt on the value of normal causalistic procedures.
K9: And, of course, vice versa.
LANE : You were asking about the warp drive?
PACKARD: Yes?
LANE : Don't ask. It's shot to hell.
RORVIK: Okay, Lane. Back in here.
RORVIK: Lane?
PACKARD: Lane? Lane? Lane! Huh! Communications are breaking up now!
RORVIK: What about you, Biroc? Are you breaking up? Why no pictures?
ALDO: He's going.
RORVIK: You blew out my warp drive. You did that on purpose.
ROYCE: What a waste. I wouldn't get much for his scrap value.
PACKARD: We've got to get him patched up. We'll lose him.
RORVIK: Typical Packard. Always thinking of your bonus.
RORVIK: Sagan, Kilroy. Take him below and get him fixed up.
RORVIK : Bridge, yes? Lane, is that you? What is it, man?
RORVIK : Well?
DOCTOR: It's always darkest before the storm.
ROMANA: Dawn.
DOCTOR: Dawn. Isn't that right, K9?
ROMANA: According to your theory, we just press any button and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Yes, well that might help.
ROMANA: But not that button!
DOCTOR: You didn't really think I'd activate the Reverse Bias, did you? Huh. It's extremely difficult to generate non-determinate action. I mean, ha. Maybe, subconsciously, I wanted to press that button.
ROMANA: In full flight?
DOCTOR: Yes. In full flight.
ROMANA: Ahem, Doctor, can I have a word with you?
ROMANA: Have you got a death wish?
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. Don't you want to get back to Gallifrey?
ROMANA: You know I don't want to get back to Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: Well, we'll burn that bridge when we come to it. It's all academic unless we find the CVE.
ROMANA: What about Adric?
DOCTOR: What about Adric?
ROMANA: Well, if we get out of E-Space, we'll be taking him away from his own universe.
DOCTOR: So?
ROMANA: Do we have that right?
DOCTOR: Oh, he'll love it on Gallifrey.
DOCTOR: What have you just done? What's he just done, K9? K9: Nondeterminate activity in accordance with the theory you were offering, master.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's perfectly all right then.
DOCTOR: You all right, Romana?
ROMANA: I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Adric?
ADRIC: I think so.
DOCTOR: Good.
DOCTOR: Ah! Time winds!
RORVIK: So now we've got a busted warp motor and no navigator. Nowhere to go and no way of getting there. Yes? Any views on that?
SAGAN: Wait a minute!
RORVIK: A minute. We've got all eternity.
SAGAN: I'm getting something on the short range scanner.
RORVIK: What is it?
SAGAN: I don't know, but it's solid and it's moving.
PACKARD: I've got it over here, too. It looks as if we've got company.
SAGAN: They're coming in to land.
ROMANA: He's out of phase.
DOCTOR: Of course. That's how he got in. He's on a different timeline.
ROMANA: But he should be torn apart.
PACKARD: They might have someone who can fix the warp motor.
RORVIK: So why are they caught between the timelines like us?
PACKARD: Well, we won't know that until we find out, will we?
RORVIK: And we still need Biroc back, or we'll have to get one of the other ones out of storage.
PACKARD: You can't revive any of them out here. You need the full apparatus.
RORVIK: Oh, we can jury rig something if necessary. So some of them may die. And that cuts into everybody's profits, a chunk out of everybody's bonus. If you want to complain, bring it to Mister Sagan here, because he's the one who managed to lose your navigator for you. We're going out to that ship.
LANE: How will I find it?
PACKARD: Portable Mass Detector. Aldo, Royce! Break it out from the stores, will you.
ROYCE: Let's have the keys then.
ALDO: I gave them to you.
ROYCE: It's non-stop, Aldo. Non-stop.
RORVIK: You'll be leading the way.
LANE: Why me?
RORVIK: In case they're hostile.
ROMANA: Can he see us?
DOCTOR: About the same way as we can see him.
ROMANA: Who are you?
BIROC: I am Biroc. Others follow.
DOCTOR: Others?
BIROC: Believe nothing they say. They are not Biroc's kind.
ROMANA: But what are you?
BIROC: The shadow of my past and of your future.
DOCTOR: The shadow of his past
ROMANA: And of our future.
DOCTOR: Romana, check those coordinates.
ROMANA: They're all locked off at zero.
DOCTOR: Yes. Now listen, you two stay here and hold the fort. I'm going to follow Biroc. Come on K9. K9? Come on. He wasn't built to withstand this type of punishment. Come on now, come on.
ADRIC: Maybe it was the time winds.
DOCTOR: He's still alive!
ROMANA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes?
ROMANA: Zero coordinates.
DOCTOR: Yes. Ponder on that.
ADRIC: Ponder on what?
ROMANA: Don't you see? Our N-space is positive and your E-space is negative.
ADRIC: I see. Then this must be the intersection. Well, somewhere near the intersection.
ROMANA: If the Doctor can find it.
ADRIC: You're sure you can repair him? What's N-space like?
ROMANA: I've just told you, Adric. It's positive.
ADRIC: Hmm. Well, I must say I'm quite looking forward to going there with you and the Doctor.
ROMANA: What if The Doctor and I went different ways?
ADRIC: But you wouldn't, would you.
ROMANA: Now, these are parts of his oops!
ROMANA: Memory. How are you feeling, K9?
K9: Misconception of the functional nature of this unit. I neither feel nor find it necessary to express states of efficiency or dysfunction.
ADRIC: Does that mean he feels all right?
ROMANA: I'll have to check.
K9: All systems functioning. Recommend priority transferred to the three humanoid life forms approaching the Tardis.
ADRIC: What? He's having delusions!
ROMANA: These stores really are the limit. Nothing's catalogued. Half the shelves are empty. This was all I could find. Adric? Adric.
ROMANA: But that's impossible. The coordinates are at zero.
K9: Probability computes at zero point zero zero zero five seven, mistress. Please apply point six seven error correction to this estimate. Error in error correction estimate estimated at point three seven zero five.
ROMANA: We should do something. He'll go like this forever.
K9: Correction. All present and correct. King's Regulations brackets Army close brackets report of the orderly sergeant to the officer of the day. Default is martial
ROMANA: It's all going to be all right, K9.
ADRIC: They've got guns! Oh, I wish the Doctor were here.
ROMANA: So do I. Oh, never mind. It's all going to be fine. I'm fully qualified. Bring me a box.
RORVIK: Well?
PACKARD: It's a solid object.
RORVIK: Check.
LANE: These readings don't make sense.
RORVIK: Oh, give me a printout.
LANE: It's a ship.
PACKARD: What, for midgets?
LANE: Or a coffin for a very large man.
RORVIK: Yes, all right, that's enough of that. Let's bust it open.
Part Two
DOCTOR: This could be a very short friendship.
ROMANA: If they've got a mass detector, they may have compatible memory wafers.
ADRIC: For K9?
ROMANA: Mmm.
ADRIC: Why don't we go out and ask them?
ROMANA: What, trust them? Remember what Biroc said.
ADRIC: And why believe Biroc?
ROMANA: Because he was running. Keep your eyes on the screen.
ADRIC: Well, then, what are we going to do?
ROMANA: I'll go. If they're all right, I'll give you a signal and you can come out. If not, stay put. Especially if I do this.
ROMANA: Hello.
RORVIK: Who are you?
ROMANA: Romanadvoratrelundar.
PACKARD: Are you alone?
ROMANA: Not now you're here. Can I help you?
RORVIK: Or can we help you?
ROMANA: It depends. Isn't that a mass detector? Rather handy for finding your way around in all this. Where are you from?
LANE: Our ship. The warp drive packed up.
RORVIK: She doesn't mean that. We're traders. Do you know what a Tharil looks like?
ROMANA: Would that be a sort of leonine mesomorph, with a lot of hair?
PACKARD: Yeah, that's him. Our navigator.
RORVIK: Have you seen him?
ROMANA: Vision is subjective. Particularly if the object is loosely connected to the time lines.
RORVIK: What do you know about the time lines?
ROMANA: My ship travels through them. So does yours.
PACKARD: How do you know that?
ROMANA: It must do. That's how we've all got stuck here. We are in the theoretical medium between the striations of the continuum.
PACKARD: Stuck? Who says we're stuck?
RORVIK: If you're time-travelling, where's your Tharil?
ROMANA: Tharils? I don't use Tharils.
PACKARD: You must use Tharils. How can you navigate if you can't see where you're going?
ROMANA: I use a digitally modelled time cone isometry parallel bussed into the image translator. Local motion is mapped in each refresh cycle
RORVIK: Yes, well, never mind all that. Biroc. Where did he go?
ROMANA: That's an interesting philosophical questions.
ADRIC: They may have compatible memory wafers. That's what Romana said.
K9: Wafers memory compatible have may they.
ADRIC: What?
K9: Query imprecise. Additional data required.
ROMANA: What's the matter with your warp drive?
LANE: It's the main power line. The insulation's gone. A few more
PACKARD: Nothing we can't fix.
RORVIK: No, wait a minute. You know about warp drive?
ROMANA: What are you using, continuum warp or implicate theory?
LANE: Supralight speed with dampers.
ROMANA: Huh. Well, it's probably your toroidal time dilators. They're usually the first to go.
ROMANA: Where is your ship?
ROMANA: This way.
PACKARD: We don't want her snooping around.
RORVIK: You don't think so?
PACKARD: No.
RORVIK: Good job you're not running this outfit. She must be a time sensitive, like the Tharils.
DOCTOR: You're a machine. I usually get on so well with machines. I don't suppose you happen to know the way out into N-space, do you? I believe it's somewhere around here. It's er.
DOCTOR: Uh oh.
K9: Alert. Danger.
ADRIC: Romana's in danger? Come on, let's get after her. No, I forgot. You stay there.
K9: Orientation in the void dangerous without computer assistance.
ADRIC: But are you up to it, K9?
K9: Question irrelevant. This unit will function at practical optimum.
RORVIK: That's her.
ROMANA: It does have a certain legendary quality. What is she? Passenger transport?
RORVIK: Bulk freighter. Full of questions, aren't you.
DOCTOR: They've cut each other dead.
PACKARD: Packard here. Party aboard. Make safe the hatchway.
MAN : What?
PACKARD: Close the door.
PACKARD : After I've gone through!
RORVIK: This way.
ADRIC: Well, I thought she went that way.
K9: Mass detection circuits indicate maximum reading on current vector. Probability of error 
ADRIC: Well, what is the probability of error, K9?
K9: Recomputing. Probability of error, eighty seven point seven nine four eight percent.
ADRIC: Eighty seven? But that's terrible!
K9: The accuracy of this unit has deteriorated below zero utility.
ADRIC: You mean you're worse than useless.
K9: Affirmative.
RORVIK: You two, get off my bridge. And stow that junk.
RORVIK: And this is the bridge, nerve centre of the whole operation.
ROMANA: What operation? What are you actually up to?
RORVIK: Oh, more questions.
ROMANA: Not many answers.
RORVIK: These are the lads with all the answers. My team. Best drill you can get. Efficient as anything on the space race, isn't that right, lads?
ALL: Yeah.
RORVIK: Isn't that right, lads?
ALL: Yes, Captain.
RORVIK: Nothing these boys can't do when they put their minds to it. Look what Captain Rorvik's brought you, lads. A new navigator.
ROMANA: Me? I can't navigate this.
RORVIK: Oh, you'll be surprised to see. Fix her up.
ALDO: Navigator? Wouldn't give her five minutes.
ROYCE: Wanna bet?
ALDO: You?
ADRIC: Perhaps you could teach me to detect mass.
K9: Zero feasibility, young master. Mass detection dependent on articulated sensors, thus.
ADRIC: Oh, I see. I suppose you use triangulation.
K9: Affirmative, young Adric.
ADRIC: Then your accuracy depends on the distance between your sensors.
K9: Deduction is correct. To anticipate logically consequent question, affirmative.
RORVIK: Let us start her off at seventy.
PACKARD: Are you sure she's a time sensitive?
RORVIK: No.
PACKARD: Oh. Because if she isn't, she'll be burnt to a frazzle.
LANE: That's how you tell.
ADRIC: You stay where you are.
K9: Mass detection error resolved. Resume.
PACKARD: That's it. Look!
RORVIK: Yes. Not very good. Step it up. Another twenty five. That's ninety five.
RORVIK: Right, cut it. Everybody here, shut up and listen. The girl was a long shot, and she isn't working out, so we're going to have to start reviving some of our precious cargo. And that'll lose a lot of bonuses if it goes wrong, and it will. We'll just have to keep at it until we find something we can use. This is a democratic ship, right? So I want to hear now from anyone who has any different ideas.
RORVIK: What in the name of all that's sacred's that? Quick, boost that voltage. Sagan, can you can get a fix?
SAGAN: It's not a time picture. It's geographical.
PACKARD: You mean something out there now?
RORVIK: Expedition gear. We're going out to it. Move! Time sensitive, huh? Don't think I've finished with you yet.
DOCTOR: Poor things. Hardly any better off than K9. Ah ha. Memory wafer.
GUNDAN: No Tharil shall outlive the day of the feast.
PACKARD: Right, stow her below.
RORVIK: No, leave her. Let's get this moving.
PACKARD: What's the hurry?
RORVIK: Up to you, Packard. Personally, I think we've just seen the way out.
RORVIK: Not joining us, gentlemen?
ROYCE: Er, well, sir, it's the string in me leg. It's gone again.
ALDO: It's the truth, sir. I saw it go.
RORVIK: Tragic. Right, you'd better break out one of the cargo and set it up for revival.
ROYCE: Revival? What, with no facilities? We can't do that.
RORVIK: I don't expect you to. We'll take care of it when we get back. Just set it up.
GUNDAN: We are Gundan. We exist to kill. Slaves made the Gundan to kill the brutes who rule.
DOCTOR: What particular brutes did you have in mind?
GUNDAN: The Gundan were sent where no slaves could go. We faced the time winds and we lived. They had only the gateway to flee for safety.
DOCTOR: Gateway? Gateway to where?
GUNDAN: Gateway. Gateway. Gateway.
DOCTOR: Gateway to where? Just as it was getting interesting. If only I had an alternative source of energy.
K9: Orders, master. Orders.
DOCTOR: K9. Just the chap I wanted.
ALDO: Heads you choose.
ROYCE: Right, that's the way it goes, I think.
ALDO: No, the other way round.
ROYCE: It don't matter. Works either way.
ALDO: Oh.
ALDO: What happens next?
ROYCE: Close down that solenoid and you're away. It's not as complicated as it looks.
ALDO: Go on, then.
ROYCE: Er, no, well, we'd better leave it to them.
ALDO: How do you know so much about it? You seen it done before?
ROYCE: Er, no, not on a ship. Something usually goes wrong. They don't like it.
ALDO: Yeah, because it means their bonus is up the spout.
ROYCE: But we're on the all-in contract.
ALDO: Switch it off!
ROYCE: You switch it off!
DOCTOR: Listen, K9, I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this, but all this stuff about the gateway is terribly important.
K9: Energy levels critical.
DOCTOR: The whole thing's critically critical, old chap. This could be the way out. Now come on, be a good dog and power up.
DOCTOR: Come on, power up. Up, up, up, up. Good dog. Now. Now. What's all this about the gateway?
GUNDAN: There were always slaves from the beginning of time. The masters descended out of the air riding the winds and took men as their prize, growing powerful on their stolen labours and their looted skills.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, look, look, I'm sure this is frightfully interesting. Could you get back on to the bit about the gateway, please?
GUNDAN: The masters created an empire, drained the life of the ordinary world.
DOCTOR: Your ordinary world. I'm from N-space.
GUNDAN: They came from the gateway.
DOCTOR: Ah ha.
GUNDAN: There are three physical gateways and the three are one.
DOCTOR: Well
GUNDAN: The whole of this domain, the ancient arch, the mirrors.
DOCTOR: The thing is, it's not actually a physical gateway that I'm looking for.
GUNDAN: All the gateways are one.
DOCTOR: Ah. So it is here. The way out.
RORVIK: Something we're all interested in, I think.
DOCTOR: Oh, hello. You seem to have attracted a big audience.
RORVIK: Let's have the rest of the recital.
DOCTOR: Ah, ahem, he, er, he doesn't seem to be too sure of his lines.
RORVIK: Prompt him. Go on, more.
DOCTOR: All the gateways are one. All the gateways are one. You see, I'm so sorry, he's completely run down. I'm the Doctor, by the way, and that's K9, and we just happened to
GUNDAN: There are three physical gateways and the three are one. This is the place from which the masters came. Here a great empire once stood, ruling all known space.
SAGAN: This must be the place
RORVIK: Shush!
GUNDAN: For all their skills, the slaves could not approach the gateway in their own persons. But once they learned its secret, we were built, the Gundan robots, to wage war on them.
DOCTOR: Gundans, eh?
RORVIK: And the secret of the gateway is?
GUNDAN: The secret of the gateway is
RORVIK: Yes? Yes?
DOCTOR: Stop that Gundan!
RORVIK: Move!
PACKARD: There's a way out through here.
RORVIK: If you know the trick.
PACKARD: We'll just have to find it, won't we?
RORVIK: That Doctor knows. Where's he gone? Find him!
PACKARD: There he is! Look!
DOCTOR: Come on, K9. Nearly there.
K9: Orders, master. Access required. Immediate priority.
Part Three
DOCTOR: Biroc, how did I get through the mirror?
BIROC: The time winds touched your hand. It will be healing now.
DOCTOR: What?
ALDO : I'll go down that way. You have a look in there.
ROYCE : Come back! It's in here!
ALDO : You first, then.
ROMANA: They're looking for you. Hide.
RORVIK: No! No brute force. This needs some thought.
K9: Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.
RORVIK: Thought, I said.
DOCTOR: But what about K9? The time winds positively blasted him. Can he pass through the mirror?
BIROC: When the time is right.
K9: Newton's third law of motion. Action and reaction are equal and opposite.
DOCTOR: K9! If we can get him through the mirror, will it repair him?
BIROC: You have in your pocket a memory wafer you took from the Gundan.
DOCTOR: What? That's right. Yes, I have. Look. Look.
BIROC: K9 will be restored in the same way.
DOCTOR: Then we must get him here.
BIROC: That will happen. But your hand is living matter and will remain healed when you return to the other side of the mirror.
DOCTOR: So K9 can only be revived on this side of the mirror?
BIROC: Where he must stay.
DOCTOR: No, don't go. Don't go, please. Where is this place? Where have you brought us?
BIROC: You are where you were.
DOCTOR: What? The gateway still? But that's nowhere.
BIROC: For the Tharils and those with us, it opens onto a whole universe.
DOCTOR: I see. I see. E-Space. That's right. Yes, for you people it's a jumping off point for E-space, but for non-time sensitives, Biroc. Biroc, I understand. Biroc? He's gone again. It's like talking to a Cheshire cat.
ROYCE: He's not in here.
ALDO: Her mind's gone. She's dreaming.
ROYCE: I knew she couldn't take that voltage.
ALDO: Yeah, that must be it. There's nobody here.
ROYCE: How long's she going to be doing this? We can't keep checking up every five minutes.
ALDO: Plug her up again. Give her another dose.
ROYCE: You're very generous with the amperage. Do you think we should?
ALDO: Who's to tell? Come on, let's get on with it. We'll never get through here.
ROMANA: What are you doing to those creatures?
ROYCE: She's talking!
ROMANA: That's right. I'm talking to you and I want some answers.
ALDO: She did see something.
ROYCE: What did you see?
ROMANA: A time sensitive. A Tharil, wasn't he? How many more of them are there?
ALDO: Where is he?
ROMANA: Answer it!
RORVIK: Who's that, Royce?
ALDO : Aldo here, sir.
RORVIK: Break out the MZ. I've sent Packard and Lane back for it.
ALDO: He wants the MZ.
ROYCE: Not the MZ. What's he up to?
RORVIK : At the double!
ALDO: Well, at least he doesn't want us out there.
ROYCE: That's something.
SAGAN : Sagan here, Aldo.
ROYCE: Royce, sir.
SAGAN : Right. You can bring the lunch over here.
K9: Orders, master. Orders.
PACKARD: Vanish!
K9: Orders, master.
PACKARD: That was an order. The MZ'll do it.
LANE: Can't be sure.
PACKARD: Why not?
LANE: We can't be sure of anything in this place. These readings don't make sense. How can it be a shorter distance coming back than going?
PACKARD: Is that what it says?
LANE: All the machinery is packing up. It's bad luck having that girl on board, that's what it is.
K9: Reference order quote vanish unquote. To vanish, to cease to exist, to become zero. Present environment fulfils this condition. This unit awaits next order.
PACKARD: There's our bad luck.
DOCTOR: I must be crossing the striations of the time lines.
K9: Orders, master. Orders.
LANE: This thing's getting heavier.
PACKARD: I don't know. We made that trip back fast enough.
K9: Mass instability anomaly. Further data required.
LANE: Yeah, seemed like that to me too. Not as far coming back as it was going out.
K9: Imminent decision necessary.
K9: Microcosm universe system unbalanced and contracting.
PACKARD: Right, close the doors.
PACKARD: Packard. Oh, yes sir, yes. The MZ's ready.
PACKARD: No, no, no, it's bound to do the trick. What?
LANE: The girl's gone.
PACKARD: Shut up. No, not you, sir. It's Rorvik. Yes, sir. Right. Soon as we can. What?
LANE: She got out of the harness.
PACKARD: Well, she must be here somewhere. What do you know about it?
ALDO: Nothing.
ROYCE: Not us.
ALDO: Never seen anything.
PACKARD: Typical. Typical. Come on, get the MZ outside. Come on, move!
PACKARD: Rorvik's thinking of giving it a back blast if the MZ doesn't move it.
LANE: The warp motors might just stand it.
PACKARD: Might? We'll have to do better than that, Lane.
ROYCE: Never a moment to yourself on this ship.
ALDO: You pull, I'll push.
ROYCE: I don't like the sound of that.
ALDO: All right. I'll push, you pull.
ROYCE: Right.
PACKARD: Right, search the ship.
ROYCE: When was the last time we had this out?
ALDO: Oh, the Tharil hunt on Shapeer.
ROYCE: Either we're getting old or this is getting heavier.
ALDO: Bit of both, I reckon.
ADRIC: We're outside.
ROMANA: Pity. I want to be on the inside.
ADRIC: But I've just rescued you.
ROMANA: Thank you, but I have got to find out what they're up to in there. Do you know what a Tharil is?
ADRIC: No.
ROMANA: Well, there's one loose on this ship and they're all terrified of it. It's like Biroc, but horribly burnt.
ADRIC: Where's the Doctor?
ROMANA: I have seen him.
ADRIC: What is it?
ROMANA: I'm not sure. That machine they put me into. It projected an image, a gateway. The Doctor might be there.
ROMANA: Come on, let's follow him. Follow.
ROMANA: So it wasn't just a trick. There really is warp damage.
LANE: No chance of taking off with the motors in this state. Should be good for a back blast, though.
PACKARD: What's that, Lane? Lane, I'm not getting you.
PACKARD : Lane!
LANE: There's something wrong with the electrics. I'll go and check the main cables.
ADRIC: We can get back into the ship this way.
ROMANA: No, it's just a breach in the outer skin. The hull's sealed. That's funny.
ADRIC: What is it?
ROMANA: Those warp motors are huge. Three times what they need for a ship this size.
LANE: Lane again. I'm worried about these main cables. A few more inches, we'll lose all our drive power. I'm going up to check the main routings. Hello, Packard?
ROMANA: Wait here.
ADRIC: Romana?
ROMANA: It's dwarf star alloy. The whole hull's made of it.
ADRIC: Dwarf star alloy?
ROMANA: Dwarf star molecules are compacted under enormous gravitational force. That's why the alloy's so heavy.
ADRIC: No wonder they need big motors.
K9: Alert. Danger. Warning. Present mass anomaly increasing. Dimensional contraction of microcosmic system. Orders.
ROMANA: Shush!
K9: Urgent request for orders. Imminent danger of mathematical vanishing. Orders. Mass conversion anomaly. This microcosm subject to imminent dimensional instability.
ROMANA: Shush, K9.
K9: Alarm. Warning. Danger.
ROMANA: Stop him.
ADRIC: Quiet!
LANE: That damn machine again.
ROMANA: Get K9 back to the!  Go to the gateway! Go to the gateway!
PACKARD: Put her in the hold. Who's that boy? He must be another one from the blue box.
LANE: He's somewhere out there now. Do you get the feeling it's closing in around you?
PACKARD: Hmm. It's time we got back. Get the mass detector.
LANE: Get the mass detector. If it's not too much trouble.
PACKARD: Right, we're here.
SAGAN: They're here.
RORVIK: That was quick.
LANE: Very odd. Seemed no distance at all this time.
RORVIK: Right, now I want your complete attention for the next couple of minutes. This is going to be a nasty job. The MZ isn't something to fool around with. You all remember what happened the last time.
ROYCE: Right. Lunch up, lads.
DOCTOR: My goodness. You live like kings.
BIROC: We are kings.
RORVIK: Now listen, I'm only going to say this once. We're stuck here with no warp motors and no navigator. Now in practical terms that means we stay here forever unless we do something about it. Listen! And that means the mirror. There's a way through. You've all seen it. That's why we brought up the MZ. Will you listen to me when I'm talking!
RORVIK: This is very serious. We are in a terminal situation. A dead end.
DOCTOR: Such variety. Where did it all come from?
BIROC: The universe is our garden.
DOCTOR: Ah. So this is what it was all like.
BIROC: At the height of our empire, before the Tharils became the slaves of men.
DOCTOR: I notice you don't do too badly for staff. This garden of yours, the universe. How do you manage it?
BIROC: We use our power for those who travel on the time winds. The vastness of space is no obstacle. Everything is ours.
DOCTOR: Including her?
BIROC: They're only people.
DOCTOR: So you're the masters the Gundan spoke of? The enslavers.
BIROC: The weak enslave themselves, Doctor. You and I know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. This is no way to run an empire.
ROMANA: Danger! The Doctor's in danger!
ROMANA: Doctor!
RORVIK: Well, Doctor. This is a surprise.
Part Four
DOCTOR: And for me, too.
ROMANA: We must have jumped back over the striations.
DOCTOR: Yes.
RORVIK: You seem to come and go around here with a great deal of freedom.
DOCTOR: Yes. It's alarming, isn't it? And the culinary arrangements are variable, too.
RORVIK: What's the secret? Something you'd care to share with us?
ROMANA: You won't get the Doctor's help by pointing guns at him.
RORVIK: I negotiate from strength.
DOCTOR: Much the best way, if you can do it.
ROMANA: So you've mended your warp motors, then? Found a new navigator?
DOCTOR: Shush. Not so aggressive. We're all in the same boat and they know it.
RORVIK: Except that you know the way out.
DOCTOR: I do?
RORVIK: That way.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. One way only. That's for Tharils.
RORVIK: I don't believe you, and neither do my men. Do you, men?
ALL: No. No.
DOCTOR: A hungry bunch. Now, listen. There's nothing beyond those mirrors for people like us, except the reflection of what's here. Only the Tharils can enter your universe that way and that's a talent they're born with. The talent that you hunt them for.
ROMANA: A cul-de-sac?
DOCTOR: Yes. Now, unless we work very closely together, we could be caught here until the crack of doom. Oh, what's the use. Could I have one of your pickles? I had a rush lunch.
RORVIK: All right, why not. It's his last meal.
DOCTOR: Well, that goes for all of us. Yeah, soon we won't be better off than that chap over there.
DOCTOR: When the pickles run out.
RORVIK: Enough of the gossip. The secret, Doctor.
K9: Orders, master. Orders.
PACKARD: I don't believe it!
DOCTOR: K9! Where have you been, my dear old thing?
RORVIK: Is that yours?
K9: Mass conversion anomaly. Alert. Danger. Warning.
RORVIK: Oh, shut him up.
DOCTOR: Don't say that! He may have a point. What mass conversion anomaly?
K9: Dimensional contraction of the microcosmic system. Orders.
DOCTOR: Contraction? This could be serious.
ROMANA: It's the memory wafers, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: He's going a bit funny.
K9: Mathematical vanishing imminent. Warning.
DOCTOR: No, that's not funny. That's. What's causing it?
K9: Impossible to compute. Space time instability.
RORVIK: Time to play with your toys later, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I think not! If K9's right, and he usually is, this place is in worse shape than we thought it was.
PACKARD: You can't get worse than the back of beyond.
DOCTOR: Soon it may not even be that.
ROMANA: K9 says its dimensions are contracting.
RORVIK: Well, that's the silliest thing I've heard all day. Who's going to believe that?
PACKARD: Well
RORVIK: I thought you might. It's ridiculous. Space contracting?
ROMANA: And time.
PACKARD: At least hear him out. What's the hurry?
DOCTOR: Quite a lot. How long have we got, K9?
K9: Contraction curve exponential. Estimate on present data beyond capability of this unit.
ROMANA: So it's starting?
DOCTOR: Slowly.
ROMANA: But might collapse completely at any minute.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, but it would need a huge mass to disturb time and space to that extent. Even the Tardis doesn't weigh that much. Neither does their ship.
ROMANA: It might. The hull is made of dwarf star alloy.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: Dwarf star alloy.
DOCTOR: Dwarf star alloy? What are you playing at? Is it something to do with these?
ROMANA: They're slavers.
DOCTOR: Yes. Trading in time sensitives. And dwarf star alloy is the only material that will hold them.
RORVIK: And it's very expensive.
DOCTOR: How many more of those poor creatures have you got in that hulk of yours?
RORVIK: Poor creatures? Each one's worth a king's ransom, Doctor. You seem to understand business even less than you understand science. This wild theory about contraction.
DOCTOR: No wild theory about contraction. K9. No, K9. K9!
RORVIK: Hold it.
RORVIK: Your machine seems to know as much about it as you do. Get up!
PACKARD: So what you're saying is, the distances are getting shorter.
LANE: Like between the ship and here.
DOCTOR: Yes. As the domain contracts.
RORVIK: Shut up! He's playing for time.
DOCTOR: Playing for time? Quite the reverse.
LANE: He's right about one thing. The trip between here and the ship. Each time we've done it, it has been shorter.
DOCTOR: Yes, and if I can get back to my Tardis, I can prove it and find out exactly how much time we have left.
RORVIK: Oh, gobbledygook. We can deal with this in very short order. Get us through. Time's run out for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hello, Biroc.
BIROC: Doctor. You've seen our past, you've seen our present. You were right. We abused our power. But judge whether we've not suffered enough.
DOCTOR: As you said, the weak enslave themselves.
BIROC: The time of our enslavement is over. We will be free.
DOCTOR: I wish you luck. But what about us? Have you got any ideas on that count?
BIROC: Do nothing.
DOCTOR: What?
BIROC: It is done.
DOCTOR: Biroc? Biroc? It's all very well for you, but
RORVIK: Time's run out for you, Doctor.
ADRIC: Please! Please! Just let the Doctor go. I don't know what these levers do, but it's pointing in your direction.
RORVIK: Don't touch anything!
RORVIK: You poisonous runt. Who is this boy?
DOCTOR: Oh, he's just a friend of mine. Adric, Romana, get K9 outside, quickly.
RORVIK: You'll never get away with this, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Don't move, lads. It's on automatic.
DOCTOR: Come on, let's find the Tardis.
RORVIK: All right, lads, get them!
SAGAN: It's on automatic.
LANE: It doesn't have an automatic.
RORVIK: Get them!
DOCTOR: There she blows.
ADRIC: We found it.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's one of the advantages of living in a rapidly shrinking micro-universe.
ROMANA: What are the others?
DOCTOR: Other what?
ROMANA: Other advantages?
DOCTOR : Ah, well, it's difficult to say.
PACKARD: The ship's moved!
RORVIK: Contracting continuum.
PACKARD: Gobbledygook.
RORVIK: Oh, you never learn anything, do you. There's only one thing for it. Right, everybody. The MZ.
ALDO: I'm not going near that thing. That's a dangerous weapon, that it.
ROYCE: No, Rorvik knows what he's doing. He's seen us right up to now. Hasn't he?
RORVIK: Don't give up, lads. We'll go for the back blast.
ADRIC: Why don't we just dematerialise and go?
DOCTOR + ROMANA: No.
ROMANA: We can't just dematerialise and leave them. There are slaves on that ship.
ROMANA: What's happening?
DOCTOR: Shush. Mass attraction. There's something moving out there. It's shaking the entire gateway.
ADRIC: Look!
ROMANA: What's he doing? He can't take off with his warp motors in that state.
DOCTOR: Back blast.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: Back blast. He's going to use the jets to try and smash through the mirrors.
ROMANA: He's mad. The back blast backlash will bounce back and destroy everything.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: It's bound to accelerate the collapse of space around here.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: But surely that would flip you back into N-space if you dematerialised at the right moment?
DOCTOR: Shush.
ROMANA: We cannot even think of that with those slaves on board. We've got to do something.
DOCTOR: I'm not hopeful.
ROMANA: Neither am I.
ADRIC: Wait a minute. There is that damaged area.
DOCTOR: Yes. What damaged area?
ROMANA: Of course.
DOCTOR: What?
ROMANA: By the warp motors.
DOCTOR: Yes?
ROMANA: The main cable insulation is exposed. We might be able to short out his power.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Right. Stop! If I'm not back for whatever reason in thirteen and a half minutes, I want you to dematerialise.
ADRIC: Without you?
ROMANA: I am not letting you go alone.
DOCTOR: That's an order. It's about time you started accepting orders.
ROMANA: It is long past time, but how do you think you're going to find the cable?
DOCTOR: With my eyes.
ROMANA: Adric and I have seen it.
DOCTOR: Good. Come on.
ADRIC: I'm coming too.
ROMANA: You are not. It's long past time you learnt to obey orders. Now stay here, and if we are not back for whatever reason in thirteen and a half minutes, I want you to dematerialise. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I like that. I think you're improving.
ROMANA: It's a matter of complete indifference to me.
DOCTOR: Indifference? Thirteen and a half minutes.
ADRIC: I'm sure you will.
RORVIK: Steady now. I want a landing that wouldn't ripple the skin on a custard.
RORVIK: Good lads. Who's got control of the overload power?
MAN : I think it's me.
RORVIK: You think? Listen, everyone. This isn't the MZ we're messing around with here, it's a full blown back blast. I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your eye on the controls.
PACKARD: Back blast activated, and building.
RORVIK: How long till full power?
PACKARD: It's hard to tell with the motors in this state. About ten minutes.
RORVIK: Revivals. Break out the cargo.
PACKARD: What, now?
RORVIK: Well, if this works, we'll need to see where we're going.
PACKARD: You can't do a proper revival in ten minutes!
RORVIK: We'll revive them all. One of them might come through. Well, try it. Let's do something round here for a change.
ROYCE: Don't switch the light on.
ALDO: Why not?
ROYCE: Well, it's bad for them.
ALDO: What, you think this is going to do them any good?
ALDO: I don't know. Ten minutes to plug them all up. Rush, rush, rush.
SAGAN: Ready?
ROYCE: Yes, sir. Just as the Captain ordered. Meet the sardines.
SAGAN: Prepare for revival. Switch on now. Well, what's the matter?
ALDO: Er, I feel I'm coming over a bit nauseous, sir. I'll be all right with a breath of air.
SAGAN: And where do you think you're going?
ROYCE: Oh, I'll just go and make sure he's all right, sir. I'll be back in a minute.
ALDO: Psst.
ALDO: I can't stand a lot of that.
ROYCE: Funny you signed on with Rorvik.
ALDO: Light duties is what he said.
ROYCE: It'll all end in tears, mark my words.
SAGAN: Sorry, sir. It's no good.
RORVIK: No good? What kind of report's that?
SAGAN: Three tries, three rejects.
LANE: Could be the power fluctuation where we had the damage. I'll go and look.
RORVIK: Since when do you give yourself orders on my ship? I'll check the cable, you get back to the bridge. Well, break out some more.
ROMANA: The clipboard marks the spot. I'll stand guard.
RORVIK: Is this what you're looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Look here, Rorvik. You've got to stop this back blast. You'll kill us all.
RORVIK: So you say, Doctor. I say it's the only way out of here.
DOCTOR: You can't blast through those mirrors. You must realise by now it just throws the energy straight back.
RORVIK: They've got to break. Everything breaks eventually.
DOCTOR: Never mind the clipboard, short the cables.
DOCTOR: Drain the main power line. Earth it to the ladder.
ROMANA: I know. I've done it.
DOCTOR: Biroc? What are you doing here?
BIROC: Nothing.
DOCTOR: It's all right for you.
BIROC: And for you, too. Do nothing.
DOCTOR: Do nothing?
ROMANA: Of course, Doctor. Don't you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. Do nothing, if it's the right sort of nothing.
RORVIK: Run, Doctor. Scurry off back to your blue box. You're like all the rest. Lizards when there's a man's work to be done. I'm sick of your kind. Faint-hearted, do-nothing, lily-livered deadweights. This is the end for all of you! I'm finally getting something done! Bwahahahaha!
SAGAN: Here, where did you spring from? I haven't done you. Never mind, you're just what we need.
SAGAN: Just a minute! Argh!
DOCTOR: We've made it. Quick, quick, inside. What's the matter?
ROMANA: I'm not coming with you.
DOCTOR: Inside. That's an order.
ROMANA: No more orders, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: What? What a moment to choose.
ROMANA: But it is, isn't it? A moment to choose. I've got to be my own Romana.
BIROC: And we need a Time Lord.
ROMANA: Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. Wait, wait. There's something else. K9. He'll be all right with you behind the mirrors.
ROMANA: I'll take care of him.
DOCTOR: I'll miss you. You were the noblest Romana of them all.
ROMANA: The Tardis. Gone.
K9: Tardis preserved in concept, mistress. This unit contains all necessary schedules for duplication of the Tardis, mistress.
ROMANA: Exactly, K9. Biroc will help us use the gateway to travel anywhere in E-space, and we can give him time technology.
BIROC: You shall be our Time Lord, and we will travel far. Our people are enslaved on many planets.
ROMANA: And you and I, K9, are going to Biroc free them. That's something we've got to do, don't you think?
K9: Affirmative, mistress.
ADRIC: The picture's fading.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: It's gone. Nothing there.
DOCTOR: So it has. Nothing. Well, that's something.
ADRIC: How can nothing be something?
DOCTOR: Well, if the E-space image translator doesn't work, I'm hoping we're in N-space.
ADRIC: Back in your own universe.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ADRIC: Can you be sure?
DOCTOR: Did I say sure?
ADRIC: No.
DOCTOR: Yes. One solid hope's worth a cartload of certainties.
ADRIC: Will Romana be all right?
DOCTOR: All right? She'll be superb.
