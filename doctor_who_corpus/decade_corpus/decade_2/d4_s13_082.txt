Pyramids of Mars
Part One
SCARMAN : Gently. Be careful. That's it.
SCARMAN: It's perfect. It's absolutely untouched. The reliquaries are still sealed. Look at this. Great heaven, this tomb must date back to the First Dynasty of the Pharaohs. How many thousands of years since the priests sealed the inner chamber and draped this tapestry across the entrance?
SCARMAN: Achmed, your lantern, man. Quickly, quickly. It's the Eye of Horus.
ACHMED: No, Professor Scarman!
SCARMAN: Come back! Come back! I need your help! Superstitious savage. I've come too far to turn back now.
SARAH: Hey, Doctor. Doctor, look what I've found.
DOCTOR: Hello, Vicky.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Where did you get that dress?
SARAH: I just told you. I found it back there in the wardrobe. Why, don't you like it?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I always did. Victoria wore it. She travelled with me for a time.
SARAH: Well, as long as Albert didn't wear it. Oh, come on, Doctor. That's worth a smile, surely? What's the matter? You should be glad to be going home.
DOCTOR: The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord.
SARAH: I know you're a Time Lord.
DOCTOR: You don't understand the implications. I'm not a human being. I walk in eternity.
SARAH: What's that supposed to mean?
DOCTOR: It means I've lived for something like seven hundred and fifty years.
SARAH: Oh, you'll soon be middle aged.
DOCTOR: Yes! About time I found something better to do than run around after the Brigadier.
SARAH: Oh, come on. If you're tired of being UNIT's scientific advisor, you can always resign.
SARAH: What was it?
DOCTOR: The relative continuum stabiliser failed.
SARAH: No, not that. I mean the thing.
DOCTOR: What thing?
SARAH: There was a terrible face just for a second, then it was gone. You don't believe me, do you.
DOCTOR: Nothing can enter the Tardis. Unless
SARAH: Unless what?
DOCTOR: Mental projection of that force is beyond imagination, yet it might explain the stabiliser failure. Let's see. Was it at this end of the spectrum?
SARAH: No, Doctor, don't! Whatever it was, I know it was totally malevolent.
DOCTOR: We've landed.
SARAH: Where? Where have we landed?
DOCTOR: We've materialised at the correct point in space, but obviously not in time. A temporal reverse? Some vast impulse of energy has drawn the Tardis off course.
SARAH: You're saying this in UNIT HQ, but years before I knew it?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SARAH: But it's so different. It can't be the same house.
DOCTOR: It must be the old priory. The UNIT house was built on the site.
SARAH: The old priory was burnt down, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: Something's very wrong.
SARAH: Doctor, I don't like it here.
DOCTOR: Something's going on contrary to the laws of the universe. I must find out what.
COLLINS: Excuse me, sir.
NAMIN: Get out. Get out of here!  How dare you disturb me? Get out. Get out at once!
COLLINS: I'm sorry, sir, but the gentleman insisted.
NAMIN: Gentleman? What gentleman?
COLLINS: He's an old friend of Professor Scarman, sir.
NAMIN: I ordered that no one was to be admitted, Collins. I told you no callers!
WARLOCK: Don't blame Collins. Forced entry, sir.
NAMIN: This is outrageous.
WARLOCK: Call it what you like. I've a few questions to put to you.
NAMIN: All right, Collins.
NAMIN: So you have some questions?
WARLOCK: My name is Warlock. Doctor Warlock. I live in the village, and Professor Scarman is my oldest friend.
NAMIN: I am Ibrahim Namin.
WARLOCK: I know your name. It's your business that I am concerned with. Called at the lodge on my way up. Had a word with Scarman's brother, Laurence. He tells me you've had the infernal impudence to bar him from this house.
NAMIN: I am acting under instructions from Professor Scarman.
WARLOCK: I don't believe it.
NAMIN: I have his letter of authority. I have brought back from Egypt all the relics discovered by the Professor on his recent expedition. My orders are to store them safely and allow no one admittance to the Professor himself returns. That is an end to it, Doctor Warlock.
WARLOCK: Oh, no, sir. Not by a long chalk!
WARLOCK : I came here to find out what's going on, and I'm not leaving until I do.
DOCTOR: Of course, it would make an ideal headquarters for some paramilitary organisation. This room could easily be turned into a laboratory. Oh, hello.
COLLINS: Who are you? How did you get in here?
DOCTOR: Through the window. I understood the property was for sale. No?
COLLINS: Ah, you're not fooling me, sir. You came with Doctor Warlock, didn't you.
DOCTOR: Did we?
COLLINS: He asked you to scout round whilst he kept his nibs busy. Listen, if you're a friend of Doctor Warlock, sir, tell him to watch out.
SARAH: Watch out for what?
COLLINS: The Egyptian. There's no knowing what he might do. He's got the temper of the devil himself.
DOCTOR: Egyptian, eh? Is this where he keeps his relatives?
COLLINS: It's no joke, sir. He's only been here a few days. I wouldn't be staying, but, well, situations aren't easy to find at my age.
DOCTOR: What are you afraid of?
COLLINS: He locked this wing. He didn't know there was a second key. If he were to find me along here, let alone you two, he'd go stark raving mad, sir.
DOCTOR: I see. In that case, we'd better leave.
COLLINS: Oh, not this way, sir. Better go the way you came. He might see you.
DOCTOR: As you wish.
COLLINS: And remember to tell Doctor Warlock what I said, sir.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I'll remember.
WARLOCK : Utter humbug. That letter's a bogus fabrication if ever I saw one.
NAMIN : Are you alleging that it is forged?
WARLOCK : I am, sir, and I intend to prove it.
NAMIN : I warn you, Doctor Warlock, do not interfere.
WARLOCK : Are you threatening me?
NAMIN: It is not I who threaten. There are ancient powers gathering in this place. Powers beyond the comprehension of unbelievers.
WARLOCK: Ancient balderdash. Now let me warn you, Namin. Unless you give me some straight answers, I'm going to the police.
NAMIN: To say what? That a foreigner is living in Professor Scarman's house?
WARLOCK: To say that he's not been seen for weeks. That his baggage is lying unclaimed in his hotel. Oh, yes, I've had some enquiries made in Cairo.
WARLOCK: What the devil?
NAMIN: Open, the fool.
WARLOCK: Poor fellow. He's been strangled.
NAMIN: The gods have returned. I, Ibrahim Namin, servant of the true faith, rejoice in their power.
WARLOCK: Get the police. His assailant can't have got far.
NAMIN: You blind, pathetic fool. The servants of the All Powerful have arisen. When the temple is cleansed of all unbelievers, the High One himself will come among us. This is how it was written.
WARLOCK: Yes, I see. Well, I still think the police
NAMIN: You should have listened when I told you to leave, Warlock. Now you have seen too much. You must be the second unbeliever to die.
NAMIN: Abisme, Sutekh. Molachah. T'nab.
WARLOCK: It's no good, I can't go much further.
DOCTOR: You must. We're sitting ducks if we stay here.
WARLOCK: Get to the lodge. Tell Laurence
DOCTOR: Laurence?
WARLOCK: Marcus Scarman's brother. He live there. Knows me.
DOCTOR: He needs help, Sarah. You go on ahead, find the lodge.
SARAH: What about you?
DOCTOR: I'll be all right.
SARAH: Okay.
NAMIN: The All Powerful descends. O noble god, your servant hears you. Namin leaves, followed by the mummy. Sarah arrives with Laurence Scarman.)
LAURENCE: Oh, my dear chap. Is he badly hurt?
DOCTOR: He'll be all right if we can staunch the bleeding.
LAURENCE: We'd better get him back to the lodge.
SARAH: Doctor, listen. I saw a mummy. A walking mummy!
DOCTOR: Mummies are embalmed, eviscerated corpses. They don't walk.
SARAH: But this one did.
DOCTOR: Never mind about that now.
WARLOCK: Thank you.
SARAH: Now, is there anything I can get you?
WARLOCK: No, no, I'm all right now.
SARAH: Just try and rest, then.
LAURENCE: Well, in view of what you've told me, I'm going to fetch the police.
DOCTOR: No! This is much too grave a matter for the police, Mister Scarman.
LAURENCE: Too grave?
DOCTOR: Yes. They'd only hamper my investigation.
LAURENCE: Your investigations?
DOCTOR: Yes. Why do you think I'm here? Something's interfering with time, Mister Scarman, and time is my business.
LAURENCE: Who are you?
SARAH: Well, I'm Sarah Jane Smith. I'm a journalist.
LAURENCE: Journalist? Who is your companion?
SARAH: My companion? Oh, that's just the Doctor. We travel in time, Mister Scarman. I'm really from 1980.
LAURENCE: That is utterly preposterous, Miss Smith.
SARAH: Yes. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Interesting contraption.
LAURENCE: Kindly leave that alone, sir. That apparatus is delicately adjusted, and furthermore is a receiver containing highly dangerous electrical current.
DOCTOR: Yes, so I see. What year is this?
LAURENCE: What year?
DOCTOR: It's a simple enough question, surely.
LAURENCE: Are you telling me you don't know what
DOCTOR: If I knew I wouldn't ask. Don't be obtuse, man.
LAURENCE: Nineteen hundred and eleven.
DOCTOR: Ah. Splendid. An excellent year. One of my favourites. Yes. I really must congratulate you, Mister Scarman.
LAURENCE: On what?
DOCTOR: Inventing the radio telescope forty years early.
LAURENCE: That, sir, is a Marconiscope. It's purpose
DOCTOR: Is to receive radio emissions from the stars.
LAURENCE: How could you possibly know that?
DOCTOR: Well, you see, Mister Scarman, I have the advantage of being slightly ahead of you. Sometimes behind you, but normally ahead of you.
LAURENCE: I see.
DOCTOR: I'm sure you don't, but it's very nice of you to try. Now, why don't you show me how this gadget works?
LAURENCE: Do you mean you want me to
DOCTOR: Please. Just a little demonstration.
DOCTOR: Amazing. That's really amazing.
LAURENCE: I can't switch it off!
SARAH: Oh, very impressive.
LAURENCE: It's never done that before.
DOCTOR: Fascinating. A regular pattern repeated over and over again.
SARAH: Like an SOS?
DOCTOR: I wonder. Where was your aerial tuned?
LAURENCE: Mars. Why?
DOCTOR: I just thought I'd verify the signal.
LAURENCE: What's that you have, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, in principle it's exactly the same as the gadget you've invented, only less cumbersome. Yes, it is the same signal. Obviously automatic. Well, if it's a message, it shouldn't be difficult to decipher. They'd want to make it easy.
LAURENCE: Who would?
SARAH: Whoever transmitted it.
DOCTOR: Now, let's see. This pattern recurs three times in one line. Let's call that E, the commonest letter in the language.
DOCTOR: Beware Sutekh.
SARAH: Sutekh?
DOCTOR: Better known to you as Set?
SARAH: Of course, Egyptian mythology. Set or Sutekh was one of their gods. He was killed by Horus, god of light.
LAURENCE: Yes, but Egyptology and Mars?
DOCTOR: If I'm right, the world is facing the greatest peril in its history.
SARAH: Hey, wait for me.
DOCTOR: No. The forces that are being summoned into corporeal existence in that house are more powerful and more dangerous than anything even I have ever encountered. Stay here.
LAURENCE: I've an old hunting rifle that might come in useful.
DOCTOR: I never carry firearms.
LAURENCE: What I meant was that I should feel better if I could bring it.
SARAH: Bring it.
NAMIN: All high, all powerful, most noble Lord, thy humble servant welcomes thee.
NAMIN: Master, at last you are here. I, Ibrahim Namin, and all my forebears have served you faithfully through the thousands of years that you have slept. We have guarded the secret of your tomb.)
ALIEN: Stand. Look upon my face.
NAMIN: Great One, Lord Sutekh, I dare not.
ALIEN: Look.
ALIEN: Is this the face of Sutekh?
NAMIN: Master, spare me. Spare me. I am a true servant of the great Sutekh.
ALIEN: I am the servant of Sutekh. He needs no other.
ALIEN: Die. I bring Sutekh's gift of death to all humanity.
Part Two
LAURENCE: Marcus!
DOCTOR: Shush.
SCARMAN: Take up the generator loops.
SCARMAN: Place them in position at the compass points. Activate at ground strength.
DOCTOR: Quick, hide.
SARAH: Where have they gone?
DOCTOR: To set up a deflection field around the house. He's obviously planned every step.
LAURENCE: Who, Marcus?
DOCTOR: No, Sutekh.
DOCTOR: Sutekh is breaking free from his ancient bonds. If he succeeds, he'll destroy the whole world.
SARAH: You mean Sutekh is still alive?
DOCTOR: He destroyed his own planet, Phaester Osiris, and left a trail of havoc across half the galaxy. Horus and the rest of the Osirans must have finally cornered him on Earth.
SARAH: In Egypt?
DOCTOR: The wars of the gods entered into mythology. The whole of Egyptian culture is founded upon the Osiran pattern.
LAURENCE: I'm afraid this is beyond me.
SARAH: It's beyond me, too.
DOCTOR: Ah! Found it.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: The lodestone that drew the Tardis off course.
LAURENCE: That's not a lodestone, that's just a sarcophagus.
DOCTOR: No, it isn't. It's the entrance to a time-space tunnel.
SARAH: Leading where?
DOCTOR: To Sutekh.
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor, come on. Wake up, please.
LAURENCE: It's no good. He took the full force of the blast.
SARAH: They're bound to come back soon. We're trapped! Where are you going?
LAURENCE: There's a priest hole here somewhere. Marcus and I discovered it when we were boys.
LAURENCE: There. It isn't very large, I'm afraid.
SARAH: No, well, he is though, so come and give me a hand.
 
CLEMENTS: Holy Moses.
WARLOCK: Is that you, Laurence?
WARLOCK: Marcus! Marcus, my dear fellow, you're back.
SCARMAN: Why are you here?
WARLOCK: Huh? What's the matter? For goodness sakes, old chap, don't you recognise me?
SCARMAN: Warlock.
WARLOCK: That's right. We've all been dreadfully worried about you.
SCARMAN: I came to find the other Scarman.
WARLOCK: The other? You mean your brother, Laurence?
SCARMAN: The human.
WARLOCK: Look here, old chap. If this is some kind of macabre joke?
SCARMAN: Where is the other Scarman, Warlock?
WARLOCK: Laurence went up to the house. That Egyptian servant of yours took a potshot at me! Laurence and the Doctor and some very plucky young girl went off to deal with the brute. They've been gone a devil of a time, mind you. I hope nothing's amiss.
SCARMAN: Who is the Doctor?
WARLOCK: One of Laurence's friends, I imagine. Some sort of scientist.
SCARMAN: Why does he interfere?
WARLOCK: Interfere? Now look here, Marcus
SCARMAN: All humans inside the deflection barrier will be destroyed.
WARLOCK: For heaven's sake, Marcus, what's wrong with you?
SCARMAN: Destroy this human.
WARLOCK: No, no, no! Laurence! Laurence! No!
CLEMENTS: Murdering swine.
SARAH: He's coming round.
DOCTOR: A parallax coil.
LAURENCE: What?
DOCTOR: I never expected that. A simple trap. Blew up in my face. Clever.
LAURENCE: He's delirious.
SARAH: No, shush.
DOCTOR: Never underestimate Sutekh. Thinks of everything.
DOCTOR: Where are we?
SARAH: Hiding.
DOCTOR: Where?
LAURENCE: A priest hole.
DOCTOR: In a Victorian gothic folly? Nonsense.
SARAH: You're so pedantic at a time like this. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: If only I knew the exact physical location of Sutekh. Where was your brother's expedition bound?
LAURENCE: Saqqara, I think. He wrote to say he'd discovered a blind pyramid in that region and believed it contained a mastaba.
SARAH: What?
LAURENCE: An underground burial chamber.
DOCTOR: Saqqara. Too vague, yet it might be our only chance.
SARAH: To do what?
DOCTOR: Sutekh is controlling operations here by mental force. With the equipment at the lodge, I could transmit a jamming signal.
SARAH: And block his power?
DOCTOR: With an etheric impulse projected along precisely the right axis, yes. Otherwise
SARAH: No good.
DOCTOR: The Egyptian's ring!
LAURENCE: What?
DOCTOR: It's a slave relay. Calculating the reverse polarisation should be child's play. Why didn't I think of it?
SARAH: Shush. Listen.
SCARMAN: Remove this carcass.  There are other humans within these walls. Seek and kill them.
SARAH: He's coming over.
LAURENCE: Marcus!
CLEMENTS: Professor Scarman!
SCARMAN: Seek and kill.
DOCTOR: All right, all clear.
LAURENCE: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Shush. To find that Egyptian.
SARAH: We can't search the whole priory. There's no need to. Look.
SCARMAN: Follow me.
SARAH: What do you think they're doing?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure yet.
LAURENCE: This is exceedingly interesting, Doctor. It appears to be some kind of machinery.
DOCTOR: You're right. Yes, that's resonating tuner. Part of an anti-gravity drive. Oh! They must be building a rocket.
SARAH: Egyptian mummies building rockets? That's crazy.
DOCTOR: They're not mummies, they're service robots.
SARAH: Huh?
DOCTOR: Machines.
SARAH: Machines? All right then, why are machines building rockets?
DOCTOR: So that Sutekh can escape from the power of Horus.
SARAH: Where's Sutekh now?
DOCTOR: Exactly where Horus left him seven thousand years ago. Trapped beneath a pyramid and powerless to move.
LAURENCE: Great heavens! This is unbelievable. Totally unbelievable!
DOCTOR: You're going to say it transcends all the normal laws of physics.
LAURENCE: I am, yes. I mean, it does. It's preposterous!
DOCTOR: Isn't it. I often think dimensional transcendentalism is preposterous, but it works. Would you like to look around?
LAURENCE: May I?
DOCTOR: Please.
SARAH: Well now we are here, why don't you tune up 1980 and we can, well, leave.
DOCTOR: I can't.
SARAH: Ah. Why can't you?
DOCTOR: Because if Sutekh isn't stopped, he'll destroy the world.
SARAH: But he didn't, did he. I mean, we know the world didn't end in 1911.
DOCTOR: Do we?
SARAH: Yes, of course we do!
DOCTOR: All right. If we leave now, let's see what the world will look like in 1980.
LAURENCE: I say, this is like something by that novelist chap, Mister Wells.
DOCTOR: 1980, Sarah, if you want to get off.
SARAH: It's a trick!
DOCTOR: No. That's the world as Sutekh would leave it. A desolate planet circling a dead sun.
SARAH: It can't be! I'm from 1980.
DOCTOR: Every point in time has its alternative, Sarah. You've looked into alternative time.
LAURENCE: Fascinating. Do you mean the future can be chosen, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not chosen, shaped. The actions of the present fashion the future.
LAURENCE: So a man can change the course of history?
DOCTOR: To a small extent. It takes a being of Sutekh's almost limitless power to destroy the future. Well?
SARAH: We've got to go back.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: Keep below the level of the window.
SCARMAN: Three humans within the deflection barrier have been destroyed. There are others.
SUTEKH : Eliminate them.
SCARMAN: The servicers are searching for them, but assembly of the rocket is being delayed.
SUTEKH : Destruction of the humans must not be allowed to delay the completion of the missile. That is of paramount importance.
SCARMAN: Your orders will be executed, Sutekh. I will recall two of the servicers to the rocket assembly.
LAURENCE: I can't believe that my brother. He and Doctor Warlock were the closest of friends.
DOCTOR: Well, if you can stop thinking of him as your brother it'll make it a great deal easier for you.
LAURENCE: But he is my brother!
DOCTOR: From the moment he entered Sutekh's tomb he became subject to Sutekh's will.
LAURENCE: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: As a human being, Marcus Scarman no longer exists. He is simply the embodiment of Sutekh's power. He's given the paralysed Sutekh arms and legs, a means to escape.
SARAH: If Sutekh is so totally evil, why didn't Horus and the other Osirans destroy him?
DOCTOR: It's against their code. To have killed him would have meant that they were no better than he, so they simply imprisoned him.
SARAH: How?
DOCTOR: A forcefield, controlled from a power source on Mars.
LAURENCE: Mars?
DOCTOR: Yes. That's where the signal was beamed from, remember?
LAURENCE: But how?
DOCTOR: When your brother stumbled into Sutekh's tomb, the monitoring system on Mars detected the fact and triggered off an alarm signal.
SARAH: The rocket those robots are building!
DOCTOR: Yes. Will be aimed at the power source on Mars. If those warheads reach their target, Sutekh will have released himself.
LAURENCE: To destroy the world.
DOCTOR: Not only this world. Anywhere that life is found. Right. All I need now is a magneto.
LAURENCE: A magneto. Of course.
SARAH: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: If I can block the mental beam, Scarman will collapse.
SARAH: You mean die?
DOCTOR: Well, he's not alive now in any real sense. Only Sutekh animates him. Deprived of his outside contact, Sutekh'll be as powerless as the day Horus left him.
LAURENCE: Here you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Splendid.
LAURENCE: What was that?
 
DOCTOR: Quick, Sarah, switch on the power.
LAURENCE: No, no, you'll destroy my brother!
DOCTOR: Switch on!
SUTEKH: Stop them!
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor!
SARAH: Doctor! Doctor!
Part Three
DOCTOR: The ring, Sarah. Use the ring!
SARAH: Stop!
DOCTOR: Return to control.
SARAH: Return to control! Return to control!
DOCTOR: Are you all right?
LAURENCE: Yes, I think so.
DOCTOR: You don't deserve to be. You nearly got us all killed.
LAURENCE: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: What's worse, you've probably wrecked what was my only chance of stopping Sutekh.
LAURENCE: Look, forgive me, Doctor. I was thinking of my brother.
DOCTOR: Listen! What's walking about out there is no longer your brother. It is simply an animated human cadaver. Animated by Sutekh. Do you understand?  And if Sutekh succeeds in freeing himself, the consequences will be incalculable. Stay here!
LAURENCE: Where's he going?
SARAH: To find out what Scarman's doing.
SUTEKH : It was a deliberate attempt to block my cytronic control.
SCARMAN: I know nothing, Master.
SUTEKH: I detected electromagnetic radiation. The source was within the deflection barrier.
SCARMAN : There are some humans here who have eluded the servicers. If work on the missile is delayed, they can be found and destroyed.
SUTEKH: No! The missile must be projected at the hour appointed. My freedom comes before all. Immediately thereafter, you will find and kill the humans.
SCARMAN : As you direct, Master, so it shall be.
SARAH: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's an Osiran war missile, and almost complete by the look of it.
SARAH: You mean that thing can fly?
DOCTOR: It transposes with its projection. Pyramid power.
DOCTOR: Back.
LAURENCE: Did you find out anything?
SARAH: Only that time is short.
DOCTOR: Cytronic induction.
SARAH: Huh?
DOCTOR: The robots are drawing their energy from a cytronic particle accelerator which must be in Sutekh's tomb.
SARAH: So?
DOCTOR: So, put that out of action and he'd have no workforce.
SARAH: And no missile.
LAURENCE: But Sutekh's tomb is in Egypt.
DOCTOR: Scarman came here through the time-space tunnel. It's a two-way mechanism.
SARAH: But if you go through it, Sutekh'll kill you!
LAURENCE: Wouldn't it be better
DOCTOR: No, it wouldn't. If I go after Sutekh, Sutekh will kill me. The missiles are aimed. Wouldn't what be better?
LAURENCE: Wouldn't it be less risky simply to blow up the projectile?
DOCTOR: With what?
LAURENCE: Blasting gelignite.
DOCTOR: Do you have some?
LAURENCE: No, but I believe Clements had a store.
DOCTOR: Clements?
LAURENCE: The poacher. I heard him fishing only a few nights ago.
DOCTOR: Where did he keep it?
LAURENCE: I'm told he had a hut on the other side of the wood.
DOCTOR: Let's go, Sarah.
SARAH: Right.
LAURENCE: Shall I show you the way?
DOCTOR: No, we'll find it.
LAURENCE: You think I'll let you down again, don't you.
DOCTOR: Mister Scarman, if you want to help, start getting the bindings off that robot.
DOCTOR: Careful. Walking into a deflection barrier is like walking into a brick wall.
SARAH: Painful.
DOCTOR: Ah. There we are. Now all we've got to do is find the door.
DOCTOR: Door.
DOCTOR: Key.
SARAH: As simple as that?
DOCTOR: No, not really.
SARAH: No, I didn't think it could be.
DOCTOR: No obvious booby traps. Are you going to help or are you just going to stand there and admire the scenery?
SARAH: Your shoes need repairing. I actually wasn't admiring the scenery. I was waiting for you to tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Just hold the base. I don't want it to fall.
SARAH: Dangerous?
DOCTOR: Very dangerous.
DOCTOR: Deactivating a generator loop without the correct key is like repairing a watch with a hammer and chisel. One false move and you'll never know the time again.
SARAH: Any more comforting thoughts?
DOCTOR: Yes. Just let me know if it starts to get warm.
SARAH: Don't worry. You'll hear me breaking the sound barrier.
SUTEKH: Interference. Interference!
DOCTOR: Just to make sure. Come on.
SCARMAN: Master, I do not understand how this can be.
SUTEKH : The barrier to the east has been deactivated.
SCARMAN : But that is not possible.
SUTEKH: It has been deactivated. The power line has gone from my monitor.
SCARMAN : The humans do not have the knowledge to shut down the deflection barrier.
SUTEKH : It is clear that an extraterrestrial intelligence is operating.
SCARMAN: An alien?
SUTEKH : Oh, I have endured an eternity of darkness and impotence. I shall not be denied now. Listen to my orders.
SCARMAN: I hear you, Master.
SUTEKH : The missile must be guarded. Two servicers must maintain constant vigilance.
SCARMAN: It shall be as you say.
SUTEKH: Once the missile is projected, you will seek out and destroy my enemies. The alien who dares to intrude, the humans, animals, birds, fish, reptiles. All life is my enemy! All life shall perish under the reign of Sutekh the Destroyer!
SCARMAN : Only Sutekh shall live!
SARAH: Just how powerful is Sutekh, Doctor?
DOCTOR: He's all-powerful. If he ever gets free, there isn't a lifeform in the galaxy that could stand against him.
SARAH: What, not even your lot, the Time Lords?
DOCTOR: Not even our lot.
DOCTOR: Sutekh was only defeated in the end by the combined might of seven hundred and forty of his fellow Osirans led by Horus.
SARAH: The seven hundred and forty gods whose names were recorded in the tomb of Tutmoses the Third.
DOCTOR: Could be.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that, if I were you. Could be a ferret.
SARAH: Argh!
SARAH: This looks like it.
DOCTOR: Ah!
SARAH: What's the matter? Not enough?
DOCTOR: Sweaty gelignite is highly unstable. One good sneeze could set it off.
SARAH: Sorry.
DOCTOR: No sign of any detonators or fuses?
SARAH: No, no, nothing else. Perhaps he sneezed?
LAURENCE: Marcus! Marcus? Don't you know me? I'm your brother.
SCARMAN: Brother?
LAURENCE: Your brother, Laurence.
SCARMAN: As Horus was brother to Sutekh.
LAURENCE: Marcus, you're ill. Let me help you. Trust me.
SCARMAN: Trust you?
LAURENCE: Look. You and I when we were boys.
SCARMAN: Laurence and Marcus.
LAURENCE: That's right. You do remember!
SCARMAN: I was Marcus.
LAURENCE: You still are. Now, let me help you.
SCARMAN: No! I am Sutekh!
LAURENCE: No, no. You went to Egypt and fell under some sort of mesmeric influence, that's all.
SCARMAN: Sutekh the great Destroyer. Sutekh, the Lord of Death. I am his instrument.
LAURENCE: Now that's all nonsense. You are Marcus Scarman, Professor of Archaeology, Fellow of All Souls, Member of the Royal Society.
SCARMAN: What do you know of Sutekh? Where are the others?
LAURENCE: Others?
SCARMAN: You are being helped. Sutekh has detected an alien intelligence amongst the humans here.
LAURENCE: Do you mean the Doctor?
SCARMAN: Doctor?
LAURENCE: Marcus, your hands.
SCARMAN: What is he? What is he?
LAURENCE: Marcus, please.
DOCTOR:  It should be safe there for the moment.
SARAH : Look, this isn't going to work. You've got no detonators, no fuses, so even if you manage to place the charge without being spotted, how do we explode it?
DOCTOR: I don't know yet.
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Mister Scarman.
SARAH: Mister Scarman? Hey.
SARAH: Oh! Doctor.
DOCTOR: Strangled.
SARAH: The mummies.
DOCTOR: Not this time. There are marks. His late brother must have called.
SARAH: That's horrible! He was so concerned about his brother.
DOCTOR: I told him not to be. I told him it was too late.
SARAH: Oh! Sometimes you don't seem
DOCTOR: Human? Typical Osiran simplicity.
SARAH: A man has just been murdered!
DOCTOR: Four men, Sarah. Five, if you include Professor Scarman himself, and they're merely the first of millions unless Sutekh is stopped. Know thine enemy. Admirable advice.
SARAH: Yes.
DOCTOR: If we're going to do anything about that missile, we're going to have to move quickly. I'll need your help.
SARAH: What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: These bindings are chemically impregnated to protect the robots against damage and corrosion. An impenetrable disguise, wouldn't you say?
SCARMAN: Stop. Warhead trigger charge, phase one. This must be placed directly under the detonation head. Signify your understanding.
SCARMAN: Continue.
DOCTOR: Hurry up.
SARAH: I am hurrying.
DOCTOR: It doesn't have to be perfect. I shall mingle with the mummies but I shan't linger.
SARAH: Okay, that'll have to do.
DOCTOR: How do I look?
SARAH: It must have been a nasty accident.
DOCTOR: Don't provoke me. Come on. And don't forget the rifle.
SCARMAN: The task is almost completed, Master. We need now only the target coordinates.
SUTEKH: At last. The coordinates for the pyramid of Mars. I release them.
SUTEKH: Engage the coordinates in the projection dome monitor.
SCARMAN : Immediately, Master.
DOCTOR: You know what to do?
SARAH: Yeah. Give you time to get clear, then pow.
DOCTOR: Make sure you shoot straight. You won't get a second shot.
SARAH: Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.
SCARMAN: Stop.
SCARMAN: Stop! Turn about. Is your relay damaged? This is the coordinate selector. It is to be placed in the projection dome monitor. Indicate your understanding.
SCARMAN: Then obey your order.
SARAH: I hit it. I know I hit it.
DOCTOR: You did. Sutekh is containing the explosion.
SARAH: How?
DOCTOR: Mental power. There's only one hope left. I've got to get to him, break his concentration.
SCARMAN: I hear you, Master.
SUTEKH :  On the missile loading ramp. A crude detonation device. It must be removed immediately.
SCARMAN: Another human attempt to prevent your return? They will be caught and punished.
SUTEKH : The device! I cannot hold back the exothermic reaction for many minutes. It is taking an intense toll of available energy. Attend to the device first!
SCARMAN: It will be done immediately, Master.
SCARMAN: That device on the ramp. Remove it.
DOCTOR:  Sutekh, last of the Osirans.
DOCTOR: Argh!
Part Four
SUTEKH: No, you will not die yet. Identify yourself.
DOCTOR: Just destroy me, Sutekh. Nothing else now is left within your power.
SUTEKH: Identify yourself. It is within my power to choose the manner of your death.
SUTEKH: I can, if I choose, keep you alive for centuries, racked by the most excruciating pain. Since your interference has condemned me for ever to remain a prisoner in the Eye of Horus, it would be a fitting end. You would make an amusing diversion.
SUTEKH: Identify yourself, plaything of Sutekh.
DOCTOR: I'm a traveller.
SUTEKH: From where?
DOCTOR: Gallifrey, in the constellation of Kasterborus.
SUTEKH: Names mean nothing. What is the binary location from galactic zero centre?
DOCTOR: Ten zero eleven, zero zero by zero two.
SUTEKH: I know the planet. Data retrieval.
SUTEKH: So, you are a Time Lord.
DOCTOR: I renounced the society of the Time Lords. Now I'm simply a traveller.
SUTEKH: In time and space. In time and space?
DOCTOR:  Yes! Yes!
SUTEKH: Ah. Approach closer. What are you called, Time Lord?
DOCTOR: Doctor.
SUTEKH: I offer you an alliance, Doctor. Serve me truly, and an empire can be yours.
DOCTOR: Serve you, Sutekh? Your name is abominated in every civilised world, whether that name be Set, Satan, Sodos
SUTEKH: Serve me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Never! Argh!
SUTEKH: You pit your puny will against mine? Kneel!
DOCTOR: No!
SUTEKH: Kneel before the might of Sutekh.
SUTEKH: In my presence, you are an ant, a termite. Abase yourself, you grovelling insect.
SUTEKH: Well, speak.
SCARMAN : Sutekh, great Master, the servicers have found one of the humans responsible for the destruction of the missile.
SUTEKH: Their leader is my prisoner, Scarman. I have no interest in the humans.
SCARMAN : Then this one can be destroyed.
DOCTOR: Sarah!
SUTEKH: Kill it immediately.
DOCTOR : No! No!
SUTEKH : Wait.
SUTEKH : Keep the human alive, Scarman. It may have some use.
SCARMAN: As you command, Great One, so it shall be.
SUTEKH: You are a Time Lord. What interest have you in humans?
DOCTOR: All sapient lifeforms are our kith, Sutekh.
SUTEKH: Horus held that view. I refute it.
DOCTOR: Because you fear that other intelligent lifeforms may grow to rival you in power, so you kill all life wherever you find it.
SUTEKH: Your argument is a cloud, but I see through it into your mind. The human girl. Ah, she travels with you.
DOCTOR: If you can do that by mental force, Sutekh, then nothing can be beyond you.
SUTEKH: Nothing, except to free myself from the Eye of Horus.
DOCTOR: You use your powers for evil.
SUTEKH: Evil? Your evil is my good. I am Sutekh the Destroyer. Where I tread I leave nothing but dust and darkness. I find that good.
DOCTOR: Then I curse you, Sutekh, in the name of all nature. You are a twisted abhorrence. Argh!
SUTEKH: Any further insolence, Doctor, and I shall shred your nervous system into a million fibres. Is that understood?
SUTEKH: Scarman.
SCARMAN: I hear you, Master.
SUTEKH : My enemies have brought the means of my deliverance.
SARAH: The Tardis key!
SUTEKH : This allows you entry into the Time Lord's space machine. Take one servicer and travel to the pyramid of Mars.
DOCTOR: He won't find that possible, Sutekh.
SUTEKH: Scarman is my puppet. My mind is in his.
DOCTOR: The controls of the Tardis are isomorphic.
SUTEKH: One to one. They answer to you alone.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SUTEKH: Then I was wise to spare you. My mind is in yours!
DOCTOR: Master.
SUTEKH: Scarman?
SCARMAN: Master.
SUTEKH : I send you the Time Lord. He will control the machine. The human girl will accompany you. If the Time Lord shows the slightest sign of self-will, kill her immediately.
SCARMAN: It is understood, Great One.
SARAH: Doctor, what's happened?
SCARMAN: Stand back.
SCARMAN: He is possessed by the Great One. Whom do you serve, Time Lord?
DOCTOR: Sutekh.
SCARMAN: Who holds all life in his hands?
DOCTOR: Sutekh.
SCARMAN: Who is the bringer of death?
DOCTOR: Sutekh!
SCARMAN: Venerate his name and obey him in all things.
DOCTOR: Sutekh is supreme.
SARAH: No.
SCARMAN: Control is established, Great One.
SUTEKH : It is well. But the Time Lords are a perfidious species. Dispose of him when you reach the pyramid of Mars.
SCARMAN: It shall be done. Come.
SUTEKH : My reading indicates an antechamber under the main pyramid. Seek the control centre.
SCARMAN: Sutekh has no further need for the Time Lord. Destroy him.
SARAH: No!
SCARMAN: Come.
SARAH: Doctor.
SARAH: Ah!
DOCTOR: You're soaking my shirt.
SARAH: Oh, you're alive!
DOCTOR: Respiratory bypass system. Useful in a tight squeeze. Where are we?
SARAH: Er, pyramid of Mars.
DOCTOR: Of course. Sutekh sent Scarman here to deactivate the pyramid. Where is he?
SARAH: I thought you'd become a zombie like Scarman.
DOCTOR: Sutekh didn't need me any more, so he relaxed his grip. Now, did you see where Scarman went?
SARAH: Through that door. It's vanished!
DOCTOR: It can't have vanished. It's just not visible.
SARAH: Same difference.
DOCTOR: Scarman must be stopped. Somehow he must be stopped.
SUTEKH [OC: Stay! I sense danger. That relay switch is a power conductor terminal. Scan.
SUTEKH : The bulkhead release will be concealed.
SUTEKH [OC}: There.
SUTEKH : Now.
SARAH: Tribophysics.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: Oh.
SARAH: What are you waiting for?
DOCTOR: That's too obvious.
SARAH: What is?
DOCTOR: That is.
SARAH: Well, a door handle usually is.
DOCTOR: Not in a jail. Horus would have laid traps for the unwary.
SARAH: I thought Horus was one of the good guys.
DOCTOR: He was an Osiran, with all their guile and ingenuity. Ah.
DOCTOR: They had dome-shaped heads and cerebrums like spiral staircases. Come on.
SUTEKH : Stand back and scan.
SUTEKH: Horus. Think you can confound Sutekh with these childish stratagems?
SUTEKH : The floor is charged with explosives. Count to the fifth row up. Extreme right solenoid.
SUTEKH : Press.
SCARMAN: Come.
SARAH: It's like a Chinese puzzle.
DOCTOR: Yes. And there's a key.
SARAH: Oh, some key. Do you know what it means?
DOCTOR: Yes. Obviously the length of the lines provide a scale of measurement.
SARAH: It reminds me of City of the Exxilons.
DOCTOR: Don't touch anything.
SARAH: I wasn't going to.
DOCTOR: Well, don't. One false move and we could be blown to perdition. Feet and inches one side, metres and centimetres the other. Let's see.
DOCTOR: A hundred and twenty point three centimetres, multiplied by the binary figure ten zero zero. That's a hundred and sixty two point four centimetres, correct?
SARAH: Show-off.
DOCTOR: Hundred and sixty two point four. That's about seven stitches.
DOCTOR: In case I'm wrong.
DOCTOR: I'm right.
SARAH: Which way now?
DOCTOR: A dexadron crucible!
DOCTOR: Keep calm! Keep calm.  Poor Sarah. I should never have brought you hear.
SUTEKH: The inner chamber. The control centre of the pyramid. Make the sign of the Eye, Scarman. The sign of the Eye.
DOCTOR: I can't do it. I can't do it.
HORUS : Intruders, you face the twin guardians of Horus. One is programmed to deceive, the other points truly.
HORUS : The two switches control your fate. Instant freedom or instant death. Before you choose, you can ask one guardian one question. This is the riddle of the Osirans. Which is the guardian of life?
DOCTOR: Which indeed. They're both contra-programmed so that one will always give a false indication. One question. If I were to ask your fellow guardian the question, which switch would he indicate?
DOCTOR: I see. So if you're the true guardian, that must be the death switch. And if you're the automatic liar, you'd be trying to mislead me, so that still must be the death switch. Therefore, this has to be the one we want.
DOCTOR: Come on! Come on!
SUTEKH : At last, the Eye of Horus! Destroy! Destroy!
SCARMAN: Stand back. Deactivate.
HORUS : My servitors obey only the voice of Horus. Drive out the intruders.
SUTEKH: Destroy! Destroy!
SUTEKH: Free!
SCARMAN: I'm free! Free at last!
SARAH: He's won. Sutekh's won!
DOCTOR: No! The time factor!
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Come on, run!
SARAH: Doctor!
SUTEKH: I have won my freedom, Horus. Your curse is lifted. Now begins the reign of Sutekh the Destroyer. I shall crush this miserable world, and hurl it into the outermost depths of space. My vengeance starts here!
SUTEKH: My paralysis has left me. I can move again. I can move! Now, Horus, we shall see who rules the cosmos!
DOCTOR: We've got about twenty seconds. Here he comes.
SUTEKH: Who dares to interfere?
DOCTOR: You're caught in a temporal trap, Sutekh.
SUTEKH: Time Lord! I shall destroy you. I shall destroy you!
DOCTOR: How long do Osirans live, Sutekh?
SUTEKH: Release me!
DOCTOR: Never. You're caught in the corridor of eternity.
SUTEKH: Release me, insect, or I shall destroy the cosmos!
DOCTOR: You're a thousand years beyond the twentieth century now, Sutekh. Go on for another ten thousand.
SUTEKH: I'll spare the planet Earth. I'll give it to you as a plaything. Release me!
DOCTOR: No, Sutekh. The time of the Osirans is long past.
SUTEKH: No!
DOCTOR: Go. He lived about seven thousand years.
SARAH: He's dead. Sutekh is dead.
DOCTOR: At last.
SARAH: Look, I know that's the time control from the Tardis, but what did you do?
DOCTOR: I moved the threshold of the time space tunnel into the far future. He could never have reached the end. After the Eye was broken, I realised that we had little more than two minutes to get back here.
SARAH: But how?
DOCTOR: The time radio waves take to pass from Mars to Earth.
SARAH: Ah. So the Eye of Horus was still holding Sutekh for two minutes after it was broken.
DOCTOR: Yes. You know, the Egyptians called him the Typhonian beast.
SARAH: Doctor!
DOCTOR: That was careless of me. I forgot the thermal balance would equalise.
SARAH: Listen, this priory was burnt to the ground, remember?
DOCTOR: Yes. Perhaps it is time we were leaving. We don't want to be blamed for starting a fire, do we?
SARAH: No.
DOCTOR: I had enough of that in 1666.
SARAH: What?
DOCTOR: Come on, come on.
