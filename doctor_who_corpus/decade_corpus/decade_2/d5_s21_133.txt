Resurrection of the Daleks
Part One
STIEN: Which way?
GALLOWAY: Does it matter?
MAN: Where are we?
MAN: Run!
STIEN: Where've they gone?
GALLOWAY: Where'd you think. Come on.
LYTTON: That was a shambles.
TROOPER: The escape was prevented?
LYTTON: They got out of the warehouse. It should never have happened. And who ordered the use of machine pistols?
TROOPER: Standing orders. Nothing anachronistic is to be taken to Earth.
LYTTON: So instead we slaughter valuable specimens. Next time, stun lasers are to be used.
TROOPER: It was an unfortunate mistake.
LYTTON: Make it your last, otherwise the next execution squad will be coming for you.
TEGAN: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: I can't free the Tardis from the Time Corridor!
TEGAN: Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: No, too much turbulence. Hold on. Things must stabilise soon.
STIEN: What if they're still in there, waiting?
GALLOWAY: We must warn our own people.
STIEN: Use the Time Corridor?
GALLOWAY: You said you were a soldier. Have you no sense of loyalty?
STIEN: I'm a Quartermaster Sergeant. I'm not combat trained. I can't afford your sort of principles. Look at me, I'm not exactly in condition. I can't even run properly.
GALLOWAY: You're pathetic.
STIEN: That too.
TURLOUGH: Doctor, we're weaving in time.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I know.
TEGAN: Can't we materialise?
TURLOUGH: No, not until we're free of the Time Corridor. We risk break-up.
TEGAN: Is that true?
DOCTOR: Not if I have anything to do with it.
TEGAN: Oh, no.
GALLOWAY: They've gone.
STIEN: They could have closed the Time Corridor down. Let's get out of here. I'm scared.
GALLOWAY: The entrance to the corridor is round here somewhere.
STIEN: There's nothing there now. What was that?
GALLOWAY: A rodent.
STIEN: Wearing combat boots?
GALLOWAY: Back to the stairs, quick.
STIEN: Can you see anything?
GALLOWAY : Get out of here!
STIEN: Galloway?
STIEN: Galloway!
STIEN: Oh, Galloway.
TEGAN: What are we waiting for?
DOCTOR: The right moment. The time stress on the Tardis varies greatly. I'm waiting for the right moment to break out of the Time Corridor.
TEGAN: Can I get to my room? I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Too late, Tegan. Hold on.
DOCTOR: Hold on!
TROOPER: Check list completed. All systems functioning.
LYTTON: Raise the force shield. All troopers to battle stations. Battle speed!
TEGAN: Doctor, I can't stand much more.
DOCTOR: Hold on.
DOCTOR: We're free.
TURLOUGH: Is it over?
DOCTOR: For the moment. Are you all right?
TEGAN: Yes, I think so.
[On a large space station, a lady in a white uniform is walking down a slightly shabby corridor with a black man, who speaks.)
MERCER: I don't believe this. How long has the station been in this state?
STYLES: Since regular inspections ceased.
MERCER: This place is falling to pieces.
STYLES: Huh. And you're seeing it on a good day. If you wanted to see everything spick and span, you shouldn't have asked for a transfer to a prison. Come on!
MERCER: How'd you cope with that mess?
STYLES: By ignoring it. My only concern is the medical welfare of the crew and the prisoner.
MERCER: Isn't that rather a narrow view of your responsibilities?
STYLES: Oh, do shut up, will you? It's the only way to stay sane. You've only been here three days. You know nothing.
MERCER: I've been here long enough to learn that the morale on this station is appalling.
STYLES: If the Captain doesn't care, why should I?
MERCER: Why, indeed?
STYLES: Look, my tour of duty finishes here in eight weeks. I'm dependent on a good report from the Captain for my next promotion.
MERCER: I see.
STYLES: Oh no, I don't think you do. If I don't get a good report, I could be here for another two years.
MERCER: If Control were aware of the morale on this station, the Captain wouldn't be in command.
STYLES: It's been tried before, usually by inexperienced new boys like you. And the way you're carrying on, you are going to end up exactly like the others.
MERCER: Meaning? 
STYLES: Dead. You are the third security officer we've had here in two years. 
TURLOUGH: Doctor, we're travelling parallel to the Time Corridor.
TEGAN: Where are we going?
TURLOUGH: Twentieth century Earth, it seems.
OSBORN: How long is your tour of duty?
MERCER: Two years.
OSBORN: Oh? The Captain normally allows new arrivals to settle in before subjecting them to the tedium of Officer of the Watch. What did you do?
MERCER: I complained.
OSBORN: Someone should have warned you.
MERCER: I had every right. Have you seen the state of the defence system?
OSBORN: You fear an attack?
MERCER: That's not the point.
OSBORN: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. The only ship we ever see around here is our own supply vessel.
CREWMAN: I think you may have spoken too soon. Sensors have picked up a ship in warp drive just enter the exclusion zone.
MERCER: Inform the Captain.
OSBORN: I wouldn't bother him. Not yet. It could be anything. Let the fighters check it out first.
MERCER: What?
OSBORN: They'll be grateful for the practice.
TEGAN: Have you calculated where we are?
DOCTOR: Well, the instruments are still affected by turbulence, but I think it's 1984, London. Found it!
TURLOUGH: Doctor, where are you going?
DOCTOR: The Time Corridor. I want to find out what all this is about.
OSBORN: Fighter leader has made visual contact. It's a battle cruiser!
MERCER: Go to Red Alert. Inform the Captain.
CREWMAN: Sensors report we're being scanned, sir.
MERCER: Red Alert at once!
DOCTOR: Such neglect. A hundred years ago this place would have been bustling with activity.
TEGAN: It might be again when we find out who's operating the Time Corridor.
DOCTOR: Come on. Trouble with you, Tegan, you have no imagination.
TEGAN: That's because I can't get worked up about a load of crumbling brickwork.
MERCER: Operate the deflector shield.
CREWMAN: Power building.
MERCER: Seal airlocks.
OSBORN: The battle cruiser has attacked the fighters.
MERCER: Can we give them any supporting fire?
OSBORN: No, not at the moment.
CREWMAN: All but airlock three is sealed.
MERCER: Alert maintenance.
CREWMAN: We've been hit!
MERCER: What's happening?
OSBORN: Engineering report.
MERCER: What's happening?
OSBORN: Engineering report damage to the generating plant.
CREWMAN: Cruiser's closing in, sir.
OSBORN: I've lost contact with the fighters.
MERCER: Open fire. I said, open fire!
CREWMAN: I can't! We don't have enough power for the laser cannon. We are defenceless.
CREWMAN: Look, we should surrender!
MERCER: No!
OSBORN: But we can't fight. We don't even have a deflector shield.
STYLES: Mercer! How much longer is this slaughter to continue?
MERCER: Where's the Captain?
STYLES: Dead, along with half the crew.
OSBORN: Battle cruiser preparing to dock.
MERCER: Which airlock?
OSBORN: Three. Maintenance team's still working on it.
MERCER: I want every available man down there. Block the corridor with anything they can find.
STYLES: More killing?
MERCER: Your bile would be better directed against the enemy, Doctor.
STYLES: How long before they dock?
MERCER: Three minutes. We'd better go down to the airlock.
STYLES: Right.
MERCER: Should we be boarded, destroy the prisoner.
OSBORN: Good luck.
STIEN: Don't come in here. Soldiers.
DOCTOR: What?
DOCTOR: He'll be all right.
TEGAN: Look at the way he's dressed.
DOCTOR: He must have come down the Time Corridor.
STIEN: You've got to help me.
DOCTOR: What happened?
MERCER: Check how much longer the maintenance crew will be.
STYLES: Right.
MERCER: The cruiser's docked.
STYLES: The cruiser's docked.
MERCER: Get the shield down!
STYLES: Come on, pull!
STYLES: Pull!
STIEN: I must rest. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten since yesterday.
DOCTOR: Who's controlling the Time Corridor?
STIEN: I don't know. Have you got anything to eat?
TEGAN: Where are you from?
STIEN: Earth, but not all the prisoners are from the same period. Are you sure you haven't got anything to eat?
DOCTOR: Relax. I'm going into the warehouse.
STIEN: No! I told you, there are soldiers.
DOCTOR: Perhaps they can tell us what's going on, hmm?
STIEN: The Time Corridor's on the next level. Be careful.
MERCER: Wait until I give the order.
CREWMAN 2: Okay.
MERCER: Fire!
STYLES: Now. Now!
DALEK: Under attack. Withdraw. Regroup.
DALEK 2: Under attack.
DALEK: Withdraw.
DALEK 2: Withdraw.
DALEKS: Withdraw. Withdraw. Withdraw.
DALEKS : Regroup.
LYTTON: Fools! I told you this would happen. They mined the corridor.
BLACK: We do not want excuses. The attack must continue.
LYTTON: Only this time, as I planned.
DALEK: You will show more respect for the Supreme Dalek.
LYTTON: Your battle tactics won't work. Their position is too strong.
BLACK: You may proceed. We shall try your plan. But should you fail, you will be exterminated.
TURLOUGH: Dark, isn't it.
DOCTOR: Look around.
STIEN: I can't see Galloway's body.
TEGAN: Look, Doctor. Bullets.
DOCTOR: Recently fired.
TEGAN: Hardly alien.
DOCTOR: Why advertise who you are, hmm?
TEGAN: Where's Turlough?
DOCTOR: Turlough?
TEGAN: Where's he gone?
DOCTOR: Turlough!
ARCHER: Did you hear that?
CALDER: No, sir.
ARCHER: I thought I heard voices.
STYLES: How long before they try again?
MERCER: Soon.
STYLES: Can't we board, take the fight to them?
MERCER: I think not.
MERCER: Fire!
MERCER: Masks down! Masks down!
MERCER: Move it! We're finished. It's every man for himself.
CREWMAN: Oh, no, every man for himself?
MERCER: Destroy the prisoner.
OSBORN: It's not working!  Come with me.
DOCTOR: Turlough!
DOCTOR: Turlough!
ARCHER: May I help you, gentlemen? This is private property.
DOCTOR: Er, yes, I'm sorry about this. A friend of mine wandered in here by mistake, and we're looking for him.
ARCHER: I don't see him.
LAIRD: What's going on?
ARCHER: Precisely what I'm trying to find out.
OSBORN: Come on, come on!
TROOPER: The bridge has been secured, sir.
LYTTON: Good. We must join them.
DALEK: The Doctor has been detained in the warehouse.
BLACK: Despatch a Dalek. He must be brought to our ship at once.
DALEK: I obey.
OSBORN: Oh, does nothing work properly?
OSBORN: Try here. What's that smell?
MERCER: Well, it can't be the prisoner.
ARCHER: Time Corridors. Alien beings. Really.
STIEN: You may not believe us but all we need is a minute or two more. The entrance to the Time Corridor is on this level, somewhere.
DOCTOR: Interesting. You don't disbelieve us, do you?
ARCHER: Of course I disbelieve you. I've never heard such nonsense.
DOCTOR: What have you discovered?
ARCHER: Nothing. Take them away.
LAIRD: Tell them, Colonel. They've guessed most of it already.
ARCHER: Are you from the Press?
DOCTOR: What have you found?
ARCHER: Quiet.
DOCTOR: Tell me! Alien objects?
ARCHER: You'd better inform HQ about what's happened.
CALDER: Okay, sir.
OSBORN: Right, explosive charges primed. What is that smell?
OSBORN: Keep back!
MERCER: Help me!
OSBORN: Stay away!
MERCER: What's happening to me?
TROOPER: Disarmed.
LYTTON: Release Davros.
CALDER: It's heavy static. Can't get through to HQ.
DOCTOR: A side effect of the Time Corridor.
ARCHER: Be quiet.
ARCHER: Who's that?
DOCTOR: Don't harm her, please. She's a friend.
TEGAN: Sorry, Doctor. Look!
ARCHER: What is it?
DOCTOR: A Dalek. Take cover!
DALEK: Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
Part Two
LAIRD: Where did they come from?
STIEN: The Time Corridor.
LAIRD: From the ship you were on?
STIEN: Must be.
LAIRD: What do they want?
TEGAN: I hope we never find out.
DOCTOR: Aim for the eyepiece, the stalk at the top of the dome.
DALEK: My vision is impaired. I cannot see. My vision is impaired. I cannot see.
DOCTOR: Quickly!
DALEK: I cannot see. My vision is impaired. I cannot see. Warning. Warning.
DOCTOR: Open the door!
DALEK: I cannot see! I cannot see! Warning! Emergency!
DOCTOR: Stand clear!
LAIRD: She's all right. We should get her downstairs.
DOCTOR: While you're doing that, I'd like a hand with the debris outside.
DALEK: The Dalek sent to the warehouse has been destroyed.
BLACK: How is that possible?
DALEK: The Doctor was aided by the Earth soldiers.
BLACK: Seal the warehouse terminal of the Time Corridor. We will deal with the Doctor in due course.
STYLES: Where precisely are we going?
MERCER: Keep your mask down. There could still be gas around.
STYLES: So what. I'd rather die quickly than painfully of dehydration. Exactly how much longer are we going to wander around this place?
MERCER: Look, as far as we know, there are only four of us still alive. We can't fight the Daleks alone.
STYLES: Only minutes ago you were prepared to fight till the bitter end.
MERCER: And look where it got me. A dead crew.
STYLES: Then don't let it be for nothing.
MERCER: What can we do?
STYLES: Have you forgotten? This station has a self-destruct system.
TROOPER: He's very still. Is he dead?
LYTTON: I think not.
CALDER: Soon be ready.
LAIRD: We could all do with something a bit stronger. How's your friend upstairs?
CALDER: He's dead.
DOCTOR: How is she?
LAIRD: She's sleeping naturally.
CALDER: Tea, sir?
ARCHER: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Who discovered these cylinders?
CALDER: Builders. They're converting the warehouse into flats. Thought they were unexploded bombs.
DOCTOR: Have you tried to open one?
LAIRD: They haven't even scratched the casing.
ARCHER: Do you think the Daleks have anything to do with this?
DOCTOR: It would be an enormous coincidence if they didn't.
DAVROS: Who are you?
LYTTON: Commander Lytton.
DAVROS: Commander? My Daleks do not need troops.
LYTTON: You'd still be in prison or dead if it weren't for my men.
DAVROS: You speak as though my Daleks are no longer capable of war.
LYTTON: A lot has happened during your imprisonment.
DAVROS: The war with the Movellans is over?
LYTTON: Yes, although casualties were very high.
DAVROS: It is to be expected.
LYTTON: I'm talking about Dalek casualties.
DAVROS: Dalek casualties?
LYTTON: They lost, Davros. They were totally defeated.
CALDER: Zero three to HQ. Zero three to HQ. Over.
ARCHER: Keep trying.
DOCTOR: You must get reinforcements.
CALDER: Zero three to HQ.
ARCHER: I can't conjure them out of the air. I have to find a telephone.
LAIRD: I'll go. You're needed here.
ARCHER: This is more than a military matter now. I have to speak to the Ministry of Defence. We'll need a massive troop involvement.
CALDER: Zero three to HQ. Zero three to HQ. Over.
DOCTOR: I'll come with you.
ARCHER: You're the only one who knows anything about fighting Daleks. Your duty's here.
BLACK: He is a companion of the Doctor.
DALEK: He should be destroyed.
BLACK: He would be better used as bait. The Doctor is sentimental and emotional. He will come after the boy. This will aid the Dalek plan. Allow the boy to roam freely.
MERCER: We'll rest for a moment.
STYLES: Don't you get funny ideas? I'd give anything for a glass of cool spring mountain water.
MERCER: Quiet. Down!
MERCER: Fire!
STYLES: Careful.
MERCER: Uniforms.
STYLES: Uniforms.
LAIRD: Here, take these. It'll help your head.
DOCTOR: I won't be long. I must get back to my ship.
CALDER: Sir.
DOCTOR: I must find Turlough.
CALDER: Yes, I understand how you feel, sir, but I must ask you to wait till the Colonel gets back.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. There is isn't time. Turlough's on board the Dalek ship.
CALDER: I'm sure the Colonel won't be long.
STIEN: Let him go.
CALDER: I can't.
SOLDIER: Help!
CALDER: Are you all right, lad?
DOCTOR: Be careful.
STIEN: I was terrified it was a Dalek.
DOCTOR: It was, or at least, the remains of one.
CALDER: He's still alive.
DOCTOR: We have to find it before it tries to kill again.
LYTTON: You all right?
DAVROS: There are malfunctions in my life-support system. I require an engineer.
LYTTON: We must board the Dalek ship.
DAVROS: I must remain close to my cryogenic chamber. It may be necessary for me to be refrozen.
LYTTON: There is a time factor. The space station transmitted a distress call.
DAVROS: It will take days for a task force to arrive.
LYTTON: Not if the signal's been intercepted by a patrol ship.
DAVROS: Then you will shoot it down! I cannot be moved.
BLACK: Order an engineer to attend Davros.
DALEK: We should leave here at once.
BLACK: Without Davros, we have no future. He must be made to believe that we serve him.
STIEN: This is a waste of time. The mutant could have escaped using the Time Corridor.
DOCTOR: True, so why are you being so tentative in your search?
STIEN: We don't know for certain.
DOCTOR: Precisely. That's why we're searching the warehouse.
CALDER: What's it look like?
DOCTOR: Oh, you won't mistake it. The moment you find it, it'll try and kill you.
ARCHER: Gentlemen, you've saved my life. I'm Colonel Archer, Bomb Disposal Squad. I have to make an urgent call. May I use your radio?
ARCHER: Please?
ARCHER: Thank you. It's dead.
DAVROS: Tell be about the Dalek defeat.
LYTTON: You already know most of it. The Daleks and the Movellans were locked in an impasse. Each time their respective fleets attempted a stratagem, it was instantly anticipated and countered by their opponent's battle computer.
DAVROS: Two totally logical war machines unable to out-think each other. Fascinating. If only I'd been there.
LYTTON: Then the Movellans found the answer.
KISTON: Sorry, sir.
DAVROS: Quickly, tell me.
LYTTON: They developed a virus which exclusively attacks the Daleks. The fleet was destroyed. Those who survived went to separate parts of the universe to escape the risk of further infection and work on a cure.
DAVROS: Have they succeeded?
LYTTON: Not yet.
DAVROS: So, they have returned to their creator. Like an errant child, they have come home once more, but this time they will not abuse me. This time, I shall take my rightful place as their Supreme Being, and under my control, the Daleks shall once more become triumphant!
LYTTON: Will you be able to find an antidote?
DAVROS: Of course.
LYTTON: A lot of research has already been done.
DAVROS: I am Davros. The Daleks are my creation. If necessary, I shall genetically re-engineer them. Have you finished?
KISTON: Almost, sir.
DAVROS: I will need a laboratory.
LYTTON: There is one already prepared for you.
DAVROS: I shall work here, on the station.
LYTTON: I've explained. There isn't time.
DAVROS: I cannot risk an accident. If the virus were to escape on board the Dalek ship
LYTTON: Every precaution has been taken.
DAVROS: I work here! Or not at all.
LYTTON: I'll see what can be arranged.
DAVROS: Hurry. There is much work to be done.
KISTON: I've finished, sir.
DAVROS: Close the panel.
BLACK : I order you to obey Davros.
LYTTON: And what happens when the task force arrives from Earth?
BLACK : We shall be gone. I have a plan that will force Davros to leave of his own free will. Until then, you must supply him with everything he demands. Allow him access to the Space Station's laboratory.
KISTON: As you command.
LYTTON: What happened?
DAVROS: A small accident.
LYTTON: Are you all right?
KISTON: I caught my hand. It's nothing, sir.
STIEN: It isn't here. We haven't found the entrance to the Time Corridor, either.
DOCTOR: Temporarily disconnected, I would think.
CALDER: Doctor.
STIEN: What is it?
DOCTOR: Nothing, nothing. Go on with the search.
STIEN: So much for the conqueror of the universe. I told you it had gone.
STIEN: Is it dead?
DOCTOR: Would you care to take a look? How is he?
CALDER: It's more shock than physical. Come on, lad. Let's get you downstairs. Come on, you'll be all right.
LAIRD: What happened?
DOCTOR: The Dalek wasn't quite dead, I'm afraid. Here, take this.
CALDER: Give us a hand with him.
LAIRD: Of course.
DOCTOR: We must get back to the Tardis. I have to find the Dalek ship.
STIEN: I'm not going back there. They'll kill me.
DOCTOR: I need your help.
STIEN: Help? Huh. You don't know how much of a coward I am.
DOCTOR: Well, you can take this opportunity to show me. Come along.
MERCER: Kill him!
STYLES: Wait. At least question him first.
TEGAN: What happened? What was that shooting?
CALDER: A small problem with a Dalek.
TEGAN: He'd be more comfortable over here.
LAIRD: Stay where you are.
CALDER: It looks superficial.
LAIRD: As long as there isn't any poison in it. Well, it was caused by an alien. We don't know what infection may have entered his bloodstream.
CALDER: The Colonel'll be back soon, then we get the pair of them to hospital.
DAVROS: Ninety years I was frozen in that. Ninety years of mind-numbing boredom.
LYTTON: You were conscious?
DAVROS: Every second. The creatures of Earth have no stomach for judicial murder. They prefer to leave you to slowly rot and die. They call it being humane.
KISTON: Then you must be equally humane in your revenge.
DAVROS: It is a planet I shall destroy at my leisure. But first, I must deal with a meddling Time Lord.
LYTTON: That has been anticipated.
DAVROS: You have the Doctor?
LYTTON: His capture is imminent.
DAVROS: Excellent! Once I have drained his mind of all knowledge, he shall then die slowly and painfully! He has interfered for the last time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know.
STEIN: What?
DOCTOR: It's bigger inside than out.
STIEN: I'm going mad. Daleks, Time Corridors, now this.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, soon be over.
STIEN: Yes, but will I still be sane enough to know?
STYLES: Don't do that.
MERCER: Hide your eyes if it offends you.
STYLES: Look, even an idiot like you must realise that he doesn't know anything.
MERCER: He's not a member of the crew. He must be with the Daleks.
TURLOUGH: I've told you, I'm from Earth.
MERCER: Then how did you get here?
TURLOUGH: The Dalek's Time Corridor.
MERCER: Do you believe that?
STYLES: Why not? We know the Daleks are capable of time travel.
MERCER: So we're letting him go.
STYLES: No, but we're not going to wait here for the Daleks to find us, either.
CALDER: Any one want some tea?
LAIRD: No, thanks.
TEGAN: I'd much rather have the Colonel back. How much longer is he going to be?
CALDER: Hey, where are you going, lad? Come on, you're excused duties.
LAIRD: Are you all right?
CALDER: Yeah. You stay there.
TEGAN: What's all that about?
DALEK: Activate the exit to the Time Corridor.
DALEKS: We obey.
CALDER: Come on, lad. Nothing to worry about. It's only Sergeant Calder. Colonel's gone for an ambulance. Then you'll be all right.
DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
TEGAN: That was gunfire.
LAIRD: Quickly. We should get out of here. Quickly.
ARCHER: There's nothing to worry about.
LYTTON: I'll inform him at once. Your laboratory is ready.
DAVROS: Good. I will require the assistance of a chemist.
LYTTON: Of course.
DAVROS: And Kiston. He has proven to be a competent mechanical engineer.
LYTTON: As you wish.
DAVROS: Guards?
LYTTON: An escort. There are still members of the crew still at large. It's purely a precaution.
DAVROS: I am very difficult to kill. You should already know that.
TEGAN:  That's not Colonel Archer. He gave the Doctor his gun belt, yet he's wearing one.
ARCHER: What are you two whispering about?
LAIRD: I was wondering when the ambulance for Tegan would arrive.
ARCHER: That is in hand.
TEGAN: And the reinforcements?
ARCHER: That is a military matter and therefore confidential.
LAIRD: I don't think we should wait for the ambulance.
ARCHER: This warehouse is under martial law. Attempt to leave, and I'll have the pair of you shot.
DOCTOR: That's it. I've located the Dalek ship. Now, I could drop you off at the warehouse when I collect Tegan.
STIEN: I'll come with you.
DOCTOR: Good man.
DALEK: The Doctor's Tardis has been caught in the Time Corridor.
BLACK: Prepare the duplication room.
DALEK: I obey.
DOCTOR: Turlough?
DOCTOR: Turlough? Foolish boy.
DOCTOR: Quickly, let's get out of here.
STIEN: No, Doctor.
DOCTOR: This is madness. The Daleks won't thank you for capturing me. They'll kill you.
STIEN: I didn't quite tell you the truth. I serve the Daleks. I'm a Dalek agent.
DALEKS: Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate. Exterminate! Exterminate!
Part Three
DALEKS: Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate the Doctor. Exterminate
LYTTON: Wait.
DALEK: He is an enemy of the Daleks. He must be exterminated.
LYTTON: He must be duplicated first. Confirm with the Supreme Dalek.
DALEK: Supreme Dalek confirms the order. We must take the prisoner to the duplication chamber. Proceed.
STIEN: Impulsive, aren't they.
LYTTON: They'd kill anybody, even if they need them.
STEIN: Now much longer before it's your turn?
MERCER: It's here.
STYLES: It isn't guarded.
MERCER: Be grateful.
TURLOUGH: What is it?
MERCER: Self-destruct chamber.
STYLES: Right, let's get it open.
TURLOUGH: What are you going to do?
STYLES: Guess.
LAIRD: Would anyone like some tea?
TEGAN: Please.
LAIRD: Colonel?
ARCHER: No.
LAIRD: How much longer will the ambulance be?
ARCHER: I don't know.
LAIRD: Tegan has severe concussion. It's vital she receives proper medical attention.
ARCHER: She will receive medical attention as soon as it is available.
TEGAN: Thanks very much.
LAIRD: Pity he didn't want any tea. He'd have slept for hours.
TEGAN: We've got to get out of here.
TEGAN: Do you think we could free one of these?
LAIRD: I should think so.
DALEK: Proceed.
ARCHER: They know.
CALDER: What do we do?
ARCHER: The Daleks will instruct us.
DALEK: It is vital you complete your researches as soon as possible.
DAVROS: I will need a sample of the Movellan virus.
DALEK: It will be brought to you.
DAVROS: I will also need two Daleks for experimentation.
DALEK: That is forbidden.
DAVROS: If I am to find a cure, I will need living Dalek tissue.
DALEK 2: We must consult the Supreme Dalek.
DAVROS: Do so, but be quick! Already I grow impatient.
STYLES: Where do we start?
LYTTON: Lytton.
BLACK: This is the Supreme Dalek. The self-destruct chamber has been invaded.
BLACK : The hostiles must be exterminated.
LYTTON: There isn't time. Abandon the space station.
BLACK : You should have anticipated this.
LYTTON: The original plan was to snatch Davros and leave, not dance to his every whim.
BLACK : Nothing must endanger Davros. The hostiles must be destroyed. The Daleks must be obeyed.
DALEK: You must not touch the equipment.
DOCTOR: Without the threat of death, you're quite powerless, aren't you.
DALEK: You will obey.
STIEN: It is unwise to provoke the Daleks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: However you respond is seen as an act of provocation. I know the Daleks of old. And Davros. I assume he's about here somewhere.
STIEN: You only invite trouble with your questions.
DOCTOR: Do you mean it can get worse?
STIEN: Oh, yes. The Daleks are very capable of devising painful and undignified ways of dying.
DOCTOR: But not yet. The Daleks need my brainwaves intact, don't they.
TEGAN: It's so light. What's it made from?
LAIRD: Who knows? It defied every test I could think of.
STYLES: It looks complicated.
MERCER: Try the computer. It may contain the ignition sequence.
TURLOUGH: And when you've primed your bomb, is it absolutely necessary that we die along with the station?
STYLES: Look, none of us are looking to become martyrs. You know a way out?
TURLOUGH: The Time Corridor I mentioned. It exists, it's real. We could use it to escape.
MERCER: What do you think?
STYLES: You could check it out while I try and find a way into this thing.
MERCER: Right.
DALEK: You must cooperate. You must lie down.
DOCTOR: Why isn't Davros here? I would have thought he'd have wanted to see this.
STIEN: He is otherwise detained.
DOCTOR: So, he is here.
DALEK: It does not concern you. What sort of trouble are you in this time?
TEGAN: Well?
LAIRD: Not bad.
TEGAN: But would it convince?
LAIRD: If you didn't look too hard, perhaps.
TEGAN: The truth is you'd have to be blind not to see it isn't a body.
LAIRD: Quickly!
ARCHER: You can stop pretending.
LAIRD: I don't know what you mean.
ARCHER: You're to be transferred to the Dalek ship.
LAIRD: Tegan is sick.
ARCHER: Not for much longer.
TEGAN: One way or another, we're both dead.
DAVROS: A further recruit.
DAVROS: Initiate.
DAVROS: Welcome.
STYLES: Thanks a lot. Zena?
ZENA: Lieutenant Mercer might have security clearance.
STYLES: That's a point. Get him on the radio.
ZENA: The Daleks could trace the transmission.
STYLES: Well, he can't have got far. Try him on a high-frequency range. The Daleks can't monitor them all.
STYLES: That's outside! Close the door! Dalek Troopers!
LYTTON: They must have seen us. Take out that camera.
STYLES: Build a barricade. Something we can use for protection. Now there's nothing to lose. Let's see what I can make out of you.
DOCTOR: What will you do with my duplicate?
STIEN: That does not concern you.
DOCTOR: Oh, I think it does. I've grown rather attached to myself.
DALEK: You will remain silent.
DOCTOR: I assume my brainwaves are destined for Davros. You must need his services very badly.
DALEK: The Daleks are the superior being. We do not require assistance.
DOCTOR: Superior? It took you long enough to ensnare the Tardis in the Time Corridor.
DALEK: It was but one trap.
DOCTOR: Hmm. But Stien was more effective. A living, thinking being, not some tin-pot machine.
STIEN: Please, Doctor.
DALEK: Stien is but an extension of Dalek technology.
DOCTOR: What?
DALEK: He is a duplicate. He is a product of our genetic engineering.
DOCTOR: Are you all duplicates?
STIEN: Yes.
DOCTOR: Interesting. I wonder what happened to the real you.
TURLOUGH: The Time Corridor is on the other side of the airlock.
MERCER: What about the Troopers?
TURLOUGH: We kill them.
MERCER: And the Daleks? We must set the self-destruct mechanism first. We go back.
TURLOUGH: No.
MERCER: We go back.
TEGAN: Let's go.
LAIRD: No, I should stay.
TEGAN: Don't be silly, they'll kill you.
LAIRD: No, not if you can get help quickly. This isn't going to deceive anyone for very long, not unless there's someone here to help it along with a little bluff. Now you're wasting time. Go! Go! And good luck.
TEGAN: And you. I'll be as quick as I can.
LYTTON: Can we blow a hole in the wall?
TROOPER: Could.
LYTTON: Then we attack on two fronts.
DAVROS: My army continues to grow.
STYLES: I think I'm making progress.
DOCTOR: Have the soldiers from the warehouse been duplicated?
STIEN: Yes.
DOCTOR: It's very clever. Would you care to tell me how it's done?
STIEN: No.
DOCTOR: Hmm, I thought not. What about Tegan?
STIEN: She is our prisoner.
DOCTOR: She's harmless. You must release her.
DALEK: Show him.
DOCTOR: Why?
STIEN: The Doctor without his companions would be rather incongruous.
DOCTOR: Why are you doing this?
DALEK: Your duplicates will return to Gallifrey, where, at our command, you will assassinate the members of the High Council.
DOCTOR: No!
MERCER: We must do something.
TURLOUGH: With only one gun? They'd kill us.
MERCER: I have to do something.
TURLOUGH: Think about what's happening. The Daleks have a ship, so why are their Troopers trying to break into the self-destruct chamber? Why don't they leave, let your friends blow themselves to pieces?
MERCER: Tell me.
TURLOUGH: Because whatever the Daleks want is still on board.
MERCER: Davros?
TURLOUGH: You may not be able to help your friends, but you could still kill him.
DALEK: We have been sent by the Supreme Dalek.
DALEK 2: We are to assist in your research.
DAVROS: I need Dalek tissue, not help.
DALEK: You may remove tissue from us.
DAVROS: Excellent. In no way will my experiment harm you.
DALEK: Releasing docking clamp.
DAVROS: In fact, you will become considerably invigorated.
DAVROS: Perfect. Reseal your casings. Now, who do you obey?
DALEKS: We obey Davros. He is our master.
DAVROS: Excellent. Now all I require is a sample of the Movellan virus. Find out the cause of the delay.
BLACK: Order a cylinder of Movellan virus to be transported from Earth.
DALEK: I obey.
TURLOUGH: We're too late.
MERCER: He can't be far.
TURLOUGH: We could spend hours searching for him and still not find him, and the place is crawling with Daleks.
MERCER: I have to find him. And you're coming with me.
STIEN: Nearly ready.
DALEK: The prisoner is secured. You must proceed alone. We have been summoned to other duties.
DOCTOR: Not staying till the bitter end? How disappointing.
DALEK: When it is time to die, you will, in your agony, beg to pay homage to the Daleks.  You will wait outside.
DOCTOR: Why do they take themselves so seriously?
STIEN: I warned you not to provoke them. You only make it worse for yourself.
DOCTOR: Get on with it. I can do without your pity.
STIEN: Do you think I do this because I enjoy  Do you think I do this out of ch-ch-ch-choice? D-d-do I have a ch-choice? I have no choice.
DALEK: Take the cylinder to Davros.
MERCER: Of course. Davros is using Styles' laboratory.
STYLES: We're nearly there. Why am I so excited? It'll be the last thing I ever do.
DAVROS: Perfect. I have but one more request. I require your cooperation for a little longer.
DAVROS: A spirited but foolish reaction. He will make an excellent slave. And so will you.
LAIRD: One of the cylinders disappeared!
ARCHER: Where is she? Where is she? She won't get far.
TEGAN: Hey!
TEGAN: No!
STIEN: Are you ready?
DOCTOR: You ask it as though I have a choice.
STIEN: Everyone has a ch-choice. It's in the Constitution, twenty fifth Amendment, or is it twenty sixth? Didn't you go to school?
DOCTOR: I must have played truant that day. Or maybe we didn't go to the same school. Which school did you go to?
STIEN: I, I, c-can't remember.
DOCTOR: But you remember one of the Amendments. What was the First? It's very important I know. It's very important you remember, too. Think, man. Search the area of your mind the Daleks have shut off. Resist, before it's too late.
STIEN: I must continue.
DOCTOR: Resist!
STIEN: I must continue.
ZENA: They're bypassing the door mechanism.
STYLES: You've got to hold them. I'm almost there.
LYTTON: Stand by.
STYLES: That's it.
TURLOUGH: There's nothing you can do.
MERCER: I shouldn't have left them.
TURLOUGH: You did the right thing. It's now up to you. We have to get back to Earth. Trust me.
TROOPER: Just in time.
DALEK: Your delay put the Dalek plan at risk.
LYTTON: We won. That's all that matters.
DALEK: The space station could have been destroyed. I must report this to the Supreme Dalek.
TEGAN: I'm sorry. I tried.
LAIRD: They're going to send us to the Dalek ship.
ARCHER: Get them into the Time Corridor.
LAIRD: No!
ARCHER: Into the Time Corridor with her.
, K9, Harry, Tom Baker, Sarah Jane, Jo, the Brigadier, Liz, Jon Pertwee.)
STIEN: Relax, Doctor, don't fight it. You'll only cause yourself pain. I know how you feel. The pain will pass. You must relax.
DOCTOR: Quickly, recite the Amendments. Remember your past.
STIEN: I must do my duty.
DOCTOR: You must resist. You're destroying my mind.
KISTON: The Daleks have secured the self-destruct chamber. The station is safe.
DAVROS: Excellent.
KISTON: And the Daleks have taken the Doctor prisoner.
DAVROS: Better still. He must be brought to me at once. Hurry. There is important work to do. I have waited a long time for this. Once the Doctor is exterminated, I shall build a new race of Daleks. They will be even more deadly, and I, Davros, shall be their leader! This time we shall triumph! My Daleks shall once more become the Supreme Beings!
Part Four
MERCER: Hey!
TURLOUGH: What are you doing?
MERCER: She was about to scream.
TURLOUGH: It's Tegan, you fool. She's a friend.
TEGAN: Turlough. Who is this?
MERCER: Never mind that. We must get away before the Daleks arrive.
TEGAN: Not without the Doctor.
TURLOUGH: He's here?
TEGAN: Look behind you.
TEGAN: We must find him.
STIEN: I can't stand the confusion in my mind!
DOCTOR: Quickly, release me.
STEIN: What about the guards?
DOCTOR: We'll call them in here.
DAVROS: You must secure the Tardis for me. Take the Troopers.
DALEKS: We obey.
TURLOUGH: In here.
STIEN: Now what? The Dalek conditioning could c-cloud my mind at any minute.
DOCTOR: You'll be safe in the Tardis.
STIEN: You don't understand. Under the Dalek influence I could kill you.
DOCTOR: I'll take that chance.
TEGAN: Doctor!
STIEN: Come on, move. Over there.
DOCTOR: Well, don't just stand there. Come and help.
BLACK: The Doctor is free. Your Troopers have failed.
LYTTON: More to the point, where were your Daleks?
LYTTON: This is Lytton. Call out my Special Guard.
TURLOUGH: Doctor, look. We should get out of here.
DOCTOR: Quickly. Come on.
BLACK: Lytton grows too arrogant. His mind resists our control. He must be exterminated as soon as it is convenient to the Daleks.
TEGAN: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Earth.
TURLOUGH: Best news all day.
DOCTOR: Why did the Daleks rescue Davros?
STIEN: They wanted a cure for a virus that was destroying them.
TEGAN: Is that what's in those cylinders on Earth?
STIEN: Yes.
TEGAN: Why Earth?
STIEN: They were safer there, and they acted as a lure. With the Bomb Disposal Squad duplicated, the Daleks had people to guard the warehouse who wouldn't arouse suspicion.
TEGAN: Very neat.
STIEN: Oh yes, the Daleks haven't lost any of their old guile.
TEGAN: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: To kill Davros.
TEGAN: Doctor!
DOCTOR: I must. Davros created the Daleks. He must not be allowed to save them.
TEGAN: But murder?
DOCTOR: Once before I held back from destroying the Daleks. It was a mistake I do not intend to repeat. Davros must die.
MERCER: I'm coming with you.
DOCTOR: No.
MERCER: I can show you where he is.
STIEN: I'm coming too. I wouldn't mind a taste of revenge.
DOCTOR: All right.  Wait as long as you can, but should the Daleks attack, you leave at once.
TEGAN: What about you?
DAVROS: Could this be the Doctor?
KISTON: The prisoner is certainly important. The one on the left is Stien, a member of Lytton's Special Guard. He wouldn't be assigned to escort duties otherwise.
DAVROS: The Doctor and his Tardis. Perfect!
LYTTON: Lytton.
BLACK : Davros has gained control of two Daleks. They are in the Reception area, attempting to enter the Doctor's Tardis. You must exterminate them.
LYTTON: At once.
BLACK : You must also destroy Davros. He is unreliable. He cannot be trusted.
LYTTON:  Take two men and kill Davros.
DAVROS: Welcome, Doctor. I have waited many years for this meeting.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to have detained you.
DAVROS: It was but a pleasure deferred. Now you are here, you will repay tenfold for the mental agony I suffered.
DOCTOR: I'll say one thing for you, Davros. Your conversation is totally predictable. You're like a deranged child, all this talk of killing, revenge and destruction.
DAVROS: It is the only path to ultimate power.
DOCTOR: But to what end? Just more suffering for those unlucky enough to survive?
DAVROS: Only for those who resist my will.
DAVROS: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Until I walked through that door, I foolishly hoped you'd changed enough for me not to have to do this.
DAVROS: Stien, kill him!
DOCTOR: I'm not here as your prisoner, Davros, but your executioner.
DAVROS: Listen to me. You, in your way, are not an unambitious man. Like me, you are a renegade.
DOCTOR: Save your breath. DAVROS: I had planned to completely redesign the Daleks. Kiston will confirm I am telling the truth.
KISTON: It is so.
DAVROS: My mistake was making them totally ruthless. It restricted their ability to cope with creatures who rely not only on logic, but instinct and intuition. That is a factor I wish to correct.
DOCTOR: And compassion? Are they to be programmed for that?
DAVROS: They will learn to recognise the strength that can be drawn from such an emotion.
DOCTOR: But only to make the Daleks more efficient killers.
DAVROS: To make them a more positive force.
DOCTOR: For destruction!
DAVROS: The universe is at war, Doctor. Name one planet whose history is not littered with atrocities and ambition for empire. It is a universal way of life.
DOCTOR: Which I do not accept.
DAVROS: Then you deny what is real. Join me. You will have total power at the head of a new Dalek army.
STIEN: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Outside. Deal with them.
DOCTOR: To be honest, I wouldn't know what to do with an army.
TEGAN: What's that?
TURLOUGH: The Doctor preset the controls on the timer. We're going to Earth.
TEGAN: He didn't intend to return.
TEGAN: What's happening?
TURLOUGH: We're travelling down the Dalek's Time Corridor. We're being dragged back to the warehouse!
DAVROS: You hesitate, Doctor. If I were you, I would be dead.
DOCTOR: I lack your practice, Davros.
DAVROS: You are soft, like all Time Lords. You prefer to stand and watch. Action requires courage, something you lack.
STIEN: Don't argue. You're to report to Commander Lytton at once.
MERCER: Perhaps I can convince you.
STIEN: Did you have to?
MERCER: Help me hide the bodies. Now what?
STIEN: The Dalek conditioning, it's taking hold again.
MERCER: You should have stayed in the Tardis.
TROOPER: Drop your guns!
STIEN: It's all right, they're our Troopers.
MERCER: They're Dalek Troopers.
STIEN: Stay where you are.
DOCTOR: No, no, you need medical attention.
STIEN: I can't control my mind. I'm not safe. I caused Mercer's death. I've got to get away from here.
DOCTOR: No, wait! Look, I can help you.
STIEN: Don't try to follow me. I may cause your death.
DOCTOR: I'm an imbecile.
BLACK : Your Troopers have failed. Davros still lives.
LYTTON: Then shoot the space station down. Kill everything on it.
BLACK : I must see him dead. I have dispatched Daleks to complete the task you failed. You must redeem yourself. You must destroy the Daleks of Davros.
LYTTON: Where are they?
BLACK : You must follow them to Earth. You must exterminate them.
LYTTON: Let's go.
STIEN: This isn't any good. I've got to be more positive. Oh, more positive. Self-destruct. I must find the self-destruct chamber.
TURLOUGH: This is lunacy.
TEGAN: Be quiet. The soldiers might hear you.
TURLOUGH: What's the point? We can't go back to the Dalek ship.
TEGAN: The Doctor may get back. Some other opportunity may arise. I don't know!
TURLOUGH: Absolute madness.
TEGAN: The virus in those cylinders is the only effective thing we've got to fight the Daleks with. Now, come on.
DAVROS: Go, release the virus in the Dalek ship.
 CALDER: Davros' Daleks?
ARCHER: They are to be destroyed. It is the Supreme Dalek's order.
DALEK: The Tardis is not on this level. We must search elsewhere.
ARCHER: Now!
ARCHER: Behind you!
TURLOUGH: Surely one's enough.
TEGAN: We need another.
TEGAN: All right. Let's get back to the Tardis.
LYTTON: Take cover!
DALEK: We are ready to descend.
BLACK : Proceed. Everything in the warehouse must be exterminated, including Lytton and his Troopers.
DALEKS: We obey.
DALEK: Stop. Exterminate.
DALEK: We must find the Tardis. That is our prime mission. We must obey Davros.
DALEK 2: What is happening?
DALEK: We are being attacked. The Supreme Dalek wishes us destroyed. The invading Daleks must be exterminated.
BLACK: Daleks to the self-destruct chamber. A hostile has broken in. Emergency. Emergency! He must be stopped.
DALEK 3: We must find the traitors. The enemy of the Daleks must be destroyed.
DALEK: We are not traitors. We serve our creator, Davros.
DALEK 3: The Supreme Dalek is your ruler. He must be obeyed at all times.
DALEK: Davros must be honoured.
DALEK 3: He must be exterminated. Nothing must interfere with the true destiny of the Daleks! You must be exterminated! Exterminated! Exterminated!
TEGAN: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Well done.
TURLOUGH: She's been trying to open the cylinder. I warned her that she could start an epidemic if she released the virus.
DOCTOR: The virus is only partial to Dalek. It would die once it's done its work.
TEGAN: What's happening up on the next floor?
DOCTOR: Lunch has arrived for our friend here.
DAVROS: My escape hatch is prepared.
DAVROS: Now for the Daleks.
DAVROS: I did not summon your assistance!
DALEK: We are here to exterminate you.
DAVROS: By whose order?
DALEK 2: The Supreme Dalek.
DAVROS: Exterminate me, and you abandon your lives without purpose. Join me, and I will make you rulers of the universe.
DALEK 2: Malfunction. Emergency.
DALEK: Malfunction.
DAVROS: Your lives are over.
DALEK 2: System failure.
DOCTOR: Open the doors.
DALEK: What is happening? I cannot see. My vision is impaired. Emergency.
LYTTON: They're dying. And so are you.
STIEN: Done it. I must rest. I'm tired.
DAVROS: The Daleks are dead. Long live the new Daleks!
DAVROS: What is happening? No, no. It cannot be! I am not a Dalek! I cannot die. I am Davros! 
DOCTOR: It's over.
TEGAN: It was horrible.
DOCTOR: The Earth is safe, at least until the Daleks find an antidote for the Movellan virus.
TURLOUGH: Doctor, look.
BLACK : You have not won, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You won't be able to invade Earth.
BLACK : You forget, Doctor. Daleks do not need to invade. I have my duplicates. Some have already been placed in strategic positions around the planet. The collapse of Earth society will soon occur.
DOCTOR: Your duplicates aren't stable. It won't work.
BLACK : The Daleks will triumph. We cannot fail. The Daleks' true destiny is to rule the universe.
STIEN: Hello, boys. Just in time for the fun.
DOCTOR: The Dalek ship has been destroyed.
TURLOUGH: How?
DOCTOR: The self-destruct device on the space station.
TEGAN: Davros?
DOCTOR: No, no. Stien, I would think. He must have finally decided which side he was on.
TURLOUGH: Are you sure all the duplicates are unstable?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, given time they'll all be free of Dalek control.
TURLOUGH: Shouldn't we inform Earth's authorities?
DOCTOR: Er yes. Yes, indeed. Come along.
TEGAN: I'm not coming with you.
DOCTOR: I beg your pardon?
TEGAN: I'm tired of it.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
TEGAN: A lot of good people have died today. I think I'm sick of it.
DOCTOR: You think I wanted it this way?
TEGAN: No. It's just that I don't think I can go on.
DOCTOR: You want to stay on Earth.
TEGAN: My Aunt Vanessa said, when I became an air stewardess, if you stop enjoying it, give it up.
DOCTOR: Tegan
TEGAN: It's stopped being fun, Doctor. Goodbye. Turlough.
TURLOUGH: Goodbye.
TEGAN: I'll miss you both.
DOCTOR: No, no, don't leave, not like this.
TEGAN: I must. I'm sorry. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: It's strange. I left Gallifrey for similar reasons. I'd grown tired of their lifestyle. It seems I must mend my ways. Come along.
TEGAN: Brave heart, Tegan. Doctor, I will miss you.
