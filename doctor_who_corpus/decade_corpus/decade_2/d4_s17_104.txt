Destiny of the Daleks
Episode One
DOCTOR: What a brain. Oh ho. What a brain.
DOCTOR: Do that again. Say Ah.
K9:  Ah.
DOCTOR: Ah! Ah, laryngitis. How can a robot catch laryngitis? I mean, what do you need it for, hmm? Romana! Laryngitis?
ROMANA: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Romana, the dog's got laryngitis.
DOCTOR: Sorry, I thought you were Romana. Have you seen her? What are you doing here?
ROMANA: Regenerating. Do you like it?
DOCTOR: Regenerating? What are you talking about, regenerating? Only Time Lords regenerate. Look, it's awfully nice to see you, Princess Astra
ROMANA: Romana.
DOCTOR: Romana? Ah.
K9: Ah.
DOCTOR: Shut up, K9. What are you doing in that body?
ROMANA: Regenerating. Do you like it?
DOCTOR: But you can't wear that body.
ROMANA: I thought it looked very nice on the Princess.
DOCTOR: But you can't go round wearing copies of bodies.
ROMANA: Why not? We're not going back to Atrios, are we?
DOCTOR: No.
ROMANA: Well, then.
DOCTOR: Well then, go and try another one. Go on.
ROMANA: All right.
DOCTOR: What's the trouble here? Preoccupation with external appearances.
ROMANA: I quite like this one but its a bit short.
DOCTOR: Well, lengthen it then. Go on. Trying to look like other people.
DOCTOR: It's just not important, is it, K9.  No thank you. Not today. It's what's on the inside that matters. That's what's important, isn't it, K9? Do you agree with me, K9?
DOCTOR: Too tall. Take it away. Now, listen. You listen to me in there. What you want is something warm and sensible. Something that will wear well. Something with a bit of style and, well, style. You know.
ROMANA: How about this, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Exactly! Good heavens, that's exactly right. Ha! I never realised you had such a sense of style.
ROMANA: I thought you said external appearances weren't important.
DOCTOR: Ah, but it's nice to get them right, though, isn't it.
ROMANA: Ah, but it's what's inside that counts.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
DOCTOR: Oh.
ROMANA: Don't you like it? I think it'll do very nicely. The arms are a bit long. I can always take them in.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, the arms are just fine. They're just fine. It's just that, oh well, all right, have it your own way. But get rid of those silly clothes, eh?
ROMANA: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: I don't know. It depends on the randomiser.
ROMANA: Let me know when we get there.
DOCTOR: We've arrived.
ROMANA : What?
DOCTOR: I said, we've arrived. We got there.
ROMANA : What's the place like?
DOCTOR: Eh? Oh, breathable atmosphere. High degree of seismic activity.
ROMANA : What?
DOCTOR: Lots of earthquakes.
ROMANA : Oh, seismic. I thought you said psychic.
DOCTOR: Sidekick?
ROMANA : Like it? I haven't seen it yet.
DOCTOR: Look, if you want to talk to me, will you come in here and do it, please?
ROMANA : What?
DOCTOR: Never mind.
ROMANA: There, what do you think?
DOCTOR: Oh, that's fine, that's fine. Here, take a couple of those, will you?
ROMANA: What are they for?
DOCTOR: Anti-radiation pills. The levels are quite high out here. Here's a bleeper that'll bleep when you need the next dose.
ROMANA: Right, let's see where we are.
DOCTOR: Oh look, rocks.
ROMANA: Let's go.
DOCTOR: Good. Got to do something with K9.
DOCTOR: You know the most important thing my cybernetics tutor ever taught me?
ROMANA: No, what?
DOCTOR: When replacing a brain, always make sure the arrow A is pointing to the front. Did you get that? Arrow A
ROMANA: To the front.
DOCTOR: Absolutely right.
ROMANA: Not the most inviting planet. What is it?
DOCTOR: I don't know. A feeling I've been here before.
ROMANA: D�j� vu?
DOCTOR: Oui.
ROMANA: There's something you recognise?
DOCTOR: Nothing tangible. I just have a sensation. A pervading air of. Can you feel it too?
ROMANA: Shall we go back inside?
DOCTOR: What, and never know where I've been until the end of time? I wouldn't sleep at night. Come on.
DOCTOR: Interesting.
ROMANA: Precious stones?
DOCTOR: Very precious. In a geological sense, more precious than diamonds, but I'd need a bigger bit. Ah ha! Ha ha! I was right.
ROMANA: How modest.
DOCTOR: Well then, see what you make of it.
ROMANA: A composite material. Gravel in a binding of possibly limestone and clay.
DOCTOR: Limestone and clay making?
ROMANA: Add water, cement.
DOCTOR: Add gravel.
ROMANA: Concrete.
DOCTOR: You know something? You've got all the makings of a first class navvy. Concrete. Manufactured.
DOCTOR: Look! The ruins of a city?
DOCTOR: Come on.
ROMANA: Doctor. Those tremors.
DOCTOR: Yes?
ROMANA: Could they have destroyed it? Seems to be coming from over there.
DOCTOR: Let's go this way.
ROMANA: I wonder what could have caused it?
DOCTOR: Don't know. Something fairly serious by the look of it.
DOCTOR: It seemed to be coming from right under our feet.
ROMANA: It sounded like drilling. What do you think it way?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Underworld dentist? Come on.
DOCTOR: Let's get closer.
ROMANA: A strange custom.
DOCTOR: Well, you try digging a hole through rock.
ROMANA: Like the living dead.
DOCTOR: What? The living dead? You mean a planet ruled by zombies? I want to know who lives on this planet. With one basic difference, the living are very much like the dead. Who was it said the living are just the dead on holiday? Never mind. You should meet one. You can always tell a genuine zombie.
ROMANA: How?
DOCTOR: Skin is cold to the touch. I want to get a closer look at that body.
ROMANA: They've gone! I'll keep watch.
DOCTOR: Listen. Sorry, did I startle you?
ROMANA: Yes, you did. What did you find out?
DOCTOR: The deceased was a combat pilot serving with the Third Galactic Fleet of the planet Kantra.
ROMANA: Kantra? Kantra's a tropical paradise.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: What's a Kantrian doing dying here?
DOCTOR: What's very odd, he died of exhaustion and malnutrition.
ROMANA: It's not surprising in a place like this.
DOCTOR: Except, wouldn't you have expected him to have died of radiation first?
ROMANA: Look!
DOCTOR: Well, it's not a flying saucer.
DOCTOR: Recognise the type?
ROMANA: Not specifically. Judging by design and size I'd say it had intergalactic range and time warp capability. Origin almost certainly star system 4X alpha 4.
DOCTOR: Well, without reference to my Jane's Spacecraft of the Universe, I wouldn't dispute that.
ROMANA: What's it doing now? I've never seen anything like that before.
DOCTOR: Yeah, interesting technique. Camouflage and defence.
ROMANA: For a place that looked dead, there's a lot going on.
DOCTOR: Yeah, probably hit it at the beginning of the tourist season. How far away would you say that was?
ROMANA: About a mile.
DOCTOR: Well, that's just about the distance for a good bracing walk.
ROMANA: What, we're going down there?
DOCTOR: Yeah, well, it would be less than gracious not to welcome them. We can pretend we're couriers. Come on.
ROMANA: These explosions, where are they coming from?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Got it. Underground drilling.
ROMANA: Why explosions?
DOCTOR: High impact phason drills.
ROMANA: Here?
DOCTOR: Yes, someone's imported some high technology.
ROMANA: Doctor, look out!
ROMANA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Can't a fellow get any sleep around here?
ROMANA: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: I don't know, I can't see all of me. My extremities seem unimpaired, but I'm being squashed. Can you take some of the weight?
ROMANA: No, I can't move it. Without this block, you'd have been flattened. You're lucky.
DOCTOR: We're not going to move this without help. K9 could do it if he was in one piece. I've got my
ROMANA: I'll be as quick as I can.
DOCTOR: Good.
ROMANA: Will you be all right?
DOCTOR: Who knows?
ROMANA: Don't go away, will you.
DOCTOR: I'd rather hoped you'd resist the temptation to say that. Don't forget the arrow.
ROMANA : A to the front!
DOCTOR: Origins of the Universe.
DOCTOR: Ha, ha. He got it wrong on the first line! Tut. Why didn't he ask someone who saw it happen?
ROMANA: K9!
DOCTOR: Must remember to give Romana hers.
DOCTOR: The conditions existing on the planet Magla make it incapable of supporting any lifeform. Huh. Huh. Huh. He obviously doesn't realise the planet Magla's an eight thousand mile wide amoeba that has grown a crusty shell. I wonder what he does know?
DOCTOR: Good evening. You'll forgive me if I don't rise. It's er.
ROMANA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: I must say how grateful I am to you charming people. I repeat how grateful I am to you charming people. You lifted that column off me as though it were a matchstick. I can't think for the life of me where you keep your muscles.
 
SHARREL: It is an essential qualification that all crew members are in peak condition.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Yes, part of their training, is it? Well, excuse me.
DOCTOR: Well now, I told you a little bit about myself. What about you? What brings you to, what's this planet called, by the way?
SHARREL: You don't know?
DOCTOR: No, no, I had a little trouble with my directional equipment.
SHARREL: You made a forced landing?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, something of the sort.
SHARREL: Not a world one would visit from choice.
DOCTOR: No.
SHARREL: The planet is listed in our star catalogue as D5 gamma zed alpha.
DOCTOR: Well, that's not much help. See, I'm terribly old-fashioned. I prefer names.
SHARREL: I believe the planet is called Skaro.
DOCTOR: Skaro?
SHARREL: You know it?
DOCTOR: What are you doing here?
SHARREL: The nature of our mission is secret. You'll understand, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: No, I don't understand. Why are you here on Skaro?
DALEKS: Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! Do not move! You are our prisoner! Do not move! You are our prisoner!
Episode Two
DALEK: Scan the prisoner for concealed weapons.
DALEK 2: The prisoner is unarmed.
DALEK: At my command, you will move forward. Any attempt to escape will be punished. No further warning will be given. Is that understood? Is that understood? Speak! Speak!
ROMANA: Yes! I understand.
DALEK: The prisoner will be taken to interrogation.
DOCTOR: Commander, you must tell me what you're doing here on Skaro. It's vital.
SHARREL: Why? What do you know of Skaro?
DOCTOR: Well, I'll tell you when you tell me what you're doing here.
SHARREL: Very well. I don't see why this should compromise us. Our mission is directed against the force known as the Daleks. A race of evil auto
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Thank you, I know.
SHARREL: You know the Daleks?
DOCTOR: Oh, better than you could possibly imagine.
DALEK: Answer. Answer! Answer!
ROMANA: I don't know the answer. Please leave me alone.
DALEK 2: Detector indicates truthful response.
DALEK: We will continue.
DALEK 2: You will not remove your hand from the sensor.
DALEK: Statement. Your purpose in coming here was to sabotage Dalek operations. True or false?
ROMANA: I don't know anything about the Daleks.
DALEK: Answer true or false! Answer! Answer!
ROMANA: False! False!
DALEK 2: Detector indicates truthful response.
DALEK: Statement. You are in the employ of a space power and have been sent here to spy on the Daleks. True or false?
ROMANA: False! False, false. Leave me alone.
DALEK 2: Detector indicates truthful response.
DALEK: Standard interrogation complete. Report analysis of responses.
DALEK 2: Analysis of responses indicates that subject is category nine.
DALEK: Category nine subjects represent no threat to Dalek security. Release the prisoner.
ROMANA: Does that mean I can go?
DALEK: Humanoids are useful work machines. You have no other value. You will be assigned to labour force two.
ROMANA: Labour force two?
DALEK: You will obey all Dalek commands instantly. You will complete your work schedule. If you fail, you will be exterminated.
DALEK 2: Obey all Dalek commands.
DALEK: Obey instantly.
DALEK 2: Obey without question.
DALEK: Obey.
DALEK 2: Obey.
DALEK: Obey.
DALEK 2: Obey.
DALEK 3: Obey. Obey. Obey.
DOCTOR: Commander, the Daleks.
SHARREL: Yes?
DOCTOR: I'm very familiar with their methods. It's vital I know what they're doing here.
SHARREL: That is precisely what I would like to know, too.
DOCTOR: But Commander, what
AGELLA: The patrol has found a prisoner.
SHARREL: Yes? Bring him in at once.
TYSSAN:  Starship engineer Tyssan, serving with the Deep Space Fleet out of the planet Earth.
TYSSAN: By my timescale, I was taken captive two years ago, and since then I've been a prisoner of the Daleks.
ROMANA: How long have the Daleks been guarding you?
VELDAN: A long time. I'm from the planet Sirian. The Daleks raided our settlement one day, took more than fifty of us.
JALL:  I was a civilian passenger on a space shuttle. The Daleks attacked. I was the only survivor.
VELDAN: They keep their captives in a prison ship in space. Once you're there, your life expectancy tends to be on the short side.
JALL: We thought we were lucky when we were picked to come on this mission.
ROMANA: How many of you?
JALL: About fifty. I thought there might be a chance to escape.
ROMANA: Why didn't you? The burial party I saw wasn't guarded.
VELDAN: Anyone attempting to escape and the Daleks kill five of those remaining. Escape plans are not as popular as they were.
ROMANA: And the Daleks brought you here to do this?
JALL: They've got huge machines to do the drilling, but when it comes to clearing up there's nothing as adaptable as a humanoid.
VELDAN: And nothing as expendable.
ROMANA: The Daleks would be far better off with machines for this job.
JALL: Perhaps they just enjoy subjugating humanoid races.
ROMANA: They used to be humanoid themselves.
DALEK: Silence. Silence. Silence. You will remain silent at all times.
VELDAN: Are you all right?
ROMANA: It's the radiation. I've got to get out of here.
JALL: We told you what happens if anyone tries to escape.
VELDAN: You'll get out of here when you're dead. Believe me, that's the only way. When you're dead.
DALEK: Keep away.
VELDAN: But she's sick.
DALEK: Continue with your work. Those unfit for work will be exterminated.
VELDAN: The only way you get out of here is dead.
DALEK: Proceed.
DOCTOR: Tyssan. Tyssan, what are the Daleks mining for? Tyssan. Tyssan, what are the Daleks mining for? Come on.
TYSSAN: They don't take prisoners into their confidence.
SHARREL: You were on a work party. You fell unconscious.
TYSSAN: I was left for dead. I've been on the run for days.
DOCTOR: Yes.
TYSSAN: I spotted you and the girl.
DOCTOR: Good man, good man. Yes. Why didn't you speak to me?
TYSSAN: I lost you for a while. Then I picked up the girl again.
TYSSAN: She seemed afraid. She backed away and fell down a shaft.
DOCTOR: Was she hurt?
TYSSAN: She was alive.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
TYSSAN: But the Daleks got her.
DOCTOR: What!
TYSSAN: I went to help her. They took her away.
DOCTOR: Come over here. Tyssan, it's vital I get into Dalek control. Can you show me a way?
TYSSAN: You'd be taking a tremendous risk.
DOCTOR: Never mind. Can you do it?
TYSSAN: I think so.
DOCTOR: Good.
SHARREL: I quite agree, Doctor. We'll go with you. Agella, get some weapons.
DALEK 5: Move away from the prisoner. Return to your work.
VELDAN: She's dead.
DALEK 5: Return to your work.
VELDAN: Don't you understand? She's dead!
DALEK 5: Return to your work!
JALL: You can't just leave her here like that.
DALEK 5: She will be disposed of when the work cycle is complete. Return to your work. You will obey.
TYSSAN:  Okay, it's all clear. Come on.
DOCTOR: Go back now. No more chances.
TYSSAN: No, I'll stay. I've nothing to lose. Ever since I was brought here, I've had an awful premonition I'd die on Skaro.
DOCTOR: Well, you wouldn't be the first.
SHARREL: But why should the Daleks come here, Doctor? What is the connection?
DOCTOR: The connection? This is where they were created thousands of years ago. They ravaged the place and left it for dead, as you can see. SHARREL: That doesn't tell me why they should return.
DOCTOR: No. No, indeed. Burrowing into the ruins of their own city for what? For what? Oh!
AGELLA: You have an idea?
DOCTOR: No. No, it'd be too fantastic even for the Daleks. We'll find all the answers we want in the control room. Come on.
DOCTOR: Come on.
DALEK: Report.
DALEK 2: Vertical drill three is in position.
DALEK: Penetration to lower level will commence immediately. Order the drilling will continue until penetration is complete.
DALEK 2: I obey.
DALEK: Report.
DALEK 3: Security sensors detect unauthorised movement in section seven.
DALEK: Despatch units four and six to investigate.
DALEK 2: I obey.
DALEK 4: Intruders! Intruders! Exterminate! Seek and locate!
TYSSAN: The main control centre, about five hundred metres up there.
DOCTOR: Good.
TYSSAN: The place will be crawling with Daleks.
DOCTOR: Don't worry.
SHARREL: You stay and cover this exit, Lan. We may need to get out of here in a hurry.
DOCTOR: Are you three coming?
DALEK 5: Work schedule complete. You will return to internment area. You, you, remove the body.
DALEK: Report.
DALEK 4 : Units four and six. Investigation of section seven commencing.
DALEK: Proceed. I will advise.
SHARREL: Agella, cover this entrance.
DOCTOR: Tyssan. Tyssan!
TYSSAN: Explosives and timers. Powerful, too. They use them in the excavations.
DOCTOR: That looks interesting.
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Floor plans of the old Kaled city.
TYSSAN: Kaled?
DOCTOR: Yes. Never mind about that. This is the first underground level where we are now.
DOCTOR: That's the second. And if I'm right, the Daleks have penetrated to level there. Which means that their objective must be the third section.
SHARREL: Yes, but what is it?
DOCTOR: I have an uneasy feeling I know. Now. That's odd. There's no plan of the fourth level.
TYSSAN: Perhaps it's been destroyed.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes. There's a shaft leading directly from the surface to the fourth level which the Daleks can't possibly know about, otherwise they would have come from the surface to the fourth level and burrowed to the third. I wonder.
DALEK 6: Advise control. Intruder located and exterminated.
DALEK 4: I obey.
AGELLA: Daleks.
DOCTOR: What? Stay calm.
DOCTOR: Quick, take cover!
DOCTOR: Come on!
DALEK: Intruders! Intruders!
DALEK 2: Exterminate!
DALEK 2: Intruders! Intruders! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
DOCTOR: Let me see.
AGELLA: No.
DOCTOR: I'm a doctor.
AGELLA: He is dead.
DOCTOR: He is?
SHARREL: We cannot allow aliens to see us in death. It is against, against our code of honour. I'm sure you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. It's a privilege to meet such honourable people. Let's keep moving.
TYSSAN: What's all that about?
DOCTOR: I don't know. It'd be fascinating. Shush. Shush.
SHARREL: Quick, hurry up the shaft.
TYSSAN: What about your friend?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, don't worry. I don't give up easily.
DOCTOR: After you.
SHARREL: No, Doctor, after you.
DOCTOR: You're too kind.
DALEK: Seek, locate, exterminate. Seek, locate, exterminate.
DOCTOR: If you're supposed to be the superior race of the universe, why don't you try climbing after us? Bye, bye.
DALEK: Guard this position. I will inform control.
DOCTOR: Romana. Ha ha! I thought you were dead.
ROMANA: Well, the only way to escape the Daleks was to feign death. It's lucky they didn't know I was a Gallifreyan.
DOCTOR: Good girl.
TYSSAN: Gallifreyan?
ROMANA: Yes, they taught me at school how to stop my hearts.
TYSSAN: Hearts? How many have you got?
ROMANA: One for casual, one for best.
DOCTOR: Excuse me.
SHARREL: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes?
SHARREL: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: Dalek hunting.
DOCTOR: Now, if I'm right, there's a shaft in here that the Daleks don't know about leading straight to the bottom level. If I'm right.
DOCTOR: Ah ha. I'm right. Now, if the Daleks are looking for what I think they're looking for, we've got to get there first. We don't all need to go. Why don't you two go back to your ship and wait for us?
SHARREL: No, Doctor. I will go back to the ship. Agella will go with you. We're as anxious to find what the Daleks are looking for as you are.
DOCTOR: All right. Come on, let's clear the entrance.
TYSSAN: How did you know how to get into this level?
DOCTOR: Call it local knowledge gained a long time ago.  You gave me quite a start back there, you know. They've started drilling again. Now listen, we don't have much time. If I'm right, we should go this way.
TYSSAN: What is it we're looking for?
DOCTOR: Same thing as the Daleks.
TYSSAN: What's that?
DOCTOR: I'll tell you when I find out.
DALEK: Report.
DALEK 2: Combat units continuing intensive search.
DALEK: Hostiles must be located. Seek, locate, exterminate. Seek, locate, exterminate!
DALEK 2: Drilling has recommenced. Computer predicts penetration into objective area is imminent.
DALEK: Advise space command that our mission is almost complete.
DOCTOR: Just as I thought.
AGELLA: A humanoid?
DOCTOR: Yes. Davros, the evil genius who created the Daleks.
AGELLA: He created the Daleks?
DOCTOR: Yes. I could have stopped him.
TYSSAN: This creature looks as though he's been dead for centuries.
DOCTOR: Yes. Curious the tricks time plays on one, isn't it.
AGELLA: So that's what the Daleks have been looking for. Their creator.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: Romana, I was right.
TYSSAN: Doctor, they're breaking through.
Episode Three
DAVROS: So, the long darkness has ended and the eternity of waiting is over. The resurrection has come, as I always knew it would. Now, where are my Daleks?
DAVROS: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Davros. You don't look a day older and I'd hoped you were dead.
DAVROS: Dead? I do not die. Mark this moment, Doctor. In the history of the universe, this moment is unique. Davros lives!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I can see your long rest hasn't done anything to cure your megalomania. Have a jelly baby.
DAVROS: Where are you taking me?
DALEK 2: Entry to level three has been cleared.
DALEK: All units to proceed immediately.
DALEK: Seek and locate. Seek and locate. Do not deviate.
DALEK: Charts indicate objective located in this precise position. Objective has been removed from this location.
DALEK 2: Surface disturbance. Humanoid footprints. Follow. Follow. Follow.
DALEK: All units full alert. Emergency. Emergency. Emergency. Emergency.
DALEK: Emergency!
DAVROS: You will release me. You will return me to the Daleks.
DOCTOR: Shut up or I'll switch you off.
DOCTOR: Quick, back this way.
DOCTOR: Tyssan, back down the corridor and check it. You give me a hand with this.
DOCTOR: It's shifting. Stand back.
DOCTOR: Well, you didn't do that very well, did you.
ROMANA: I didn't do it very well?
DOCTOR: No, you didn't. Tyssan?
TYSSAN: The corridor's full of Daleks.
DOCTOR: What? Then we're effectively boxed in. We're too exposed here. Come on, get him. Let's get under cover.
DOCTOR: Get that door up. Make some sort of barrier.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
ROMANA: That wouldn't keep out a determined mouse.
DOCTOR: Well, it's got to serve. Now listen to me carefully, you two. I want you both to get out through, come over here. Good. Now, get back to the Movellan spaceship, tell them to mobilise a force and bring it here. It's vital we get Davros out of here before the Daleks find us. Off you go.
ROMANA: We'll be as quick as we can.
DOCTOR: Don't take too many chances. Come on, quick.
DOCTOR: Well. Well, now we've a little time to ourselves, I'll fill you in on some of the events that have taken place during the centuries you've been, er, dozing.
DAVROS: Well?
DOCTOR: Well, Arcturus won the Galactic Olympic Games. Betelgeuse came a close second. The economy on Algo's in a terrible state due to irreversible inflation
DAVROS: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What? Yes?
DAVROS: Do you believe your puny efforts can change the course of destiny?
DOCTOR: Well, let's just say I might tamper with it.
DAVROS: Destiny, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What?
DAVROS: Invincible necessity.
DOCTOR: Oh, that, that, yes.
DAVROS: Power. My power. My invincibility. My supreme plan to control
BOTH: The universe.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I've heard all that before. Now do be a good chap, eh? Stay quiet.
DOCTOR: I've got to concentrate.
DAVROS: Errors of the past will be rectified. I will add new design elements to the Dalek's circuitry. They will be armed with new weaponry. Weaponry so devastating that all matter will succumb to its power. I will equip them with all the knowledge of the universe
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, we've heard all that. The Daleks can do all that for themselves.
DAVROS: The Daleks need me.
DOCTOR: What? The Daleks left you for dead centuries ago. You've given them all you've got. What do they want you for now, eh? What's so special about the Movellans that they need your help again, eh?
SHARREL: The Daleks have gained their objective. Their objective has been identified.
SHARREL: Name, Davros. Function, creator of the Daleks. Species type, mutant humanoid. This data will be processed. Strategy will be determined shortly.
ROMANA: How much further?
TYSSAN: Across that next rise. Shouldn't take long now.
TYSSAN: We could go back, take another way around.
ROMANA: We haven't got that long. It's only a question of time before the Daleks find the Doctor.
TYSSAN: Get under cover. I'll try and lead them off. When I get clear I'll get to the ship as soon as I can.
ROMANA: Okay.
DOCTOR: There, that should do it. Very good. Well, aren't you going to ask me what it is? All right, I'll tell you anyway. Life insurance. What were we talking about?
DAVROS: Your inevitable destruction.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, we had that conversation last time we met. I'm more interested in your survival. I saw you destroyed. The Daleks blasted you at point-blank range.
DAVROS: Ha! There was damage to my primary life support system. The secondary and back-up circuits switched in immediately. Synthetic tissue regeneration took place whilst bodily organs were held in long-term suspension.
DOCTOR: Blimey, wasn't that outstaying your welcome in rather a big way?
DAVROS: Until the Dalek's universal supremacy is accomplished, I cannot allow myself the luxury of death.
DOCTOR: Oh, poor Davros.
DAVROS: However, it is a luxury I shall delight in bestowing upon you.
DOCTOR: You're very generous.
DAVROS: Since my entombment, I have no knowledge of the advancement of my Daleks. Of course they have achieved great things.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, oh yes. They've wreaked havoc and destruction, destroyed countless innocent lives
DAVROS: Only the beginning! Now I have returned, the campaign will begin in earnest. I have slept but now I have awakened, and the universe will be sorry.
DOCTOR: Davros, you. I have slept but now I have awakened and the universe will be. You're misquoting Napoleon! One day I'll tell you what happened to him, too.
DAVROS: Armed with new technology, I will
DALEK 2: You will move into the open. If you fail to obey in five seconds, you will be exterminated. One, two, three, four
DOCTOR: Hold it, hold it. Now, tell them what I've got here.
DAVROS: He is holding a primed explosive device.
DOCTOR: And one false move and it goes right down inside his chair. I'll turn Davros and his life-support system into scrap metal. Now back off!
DALEK 2: We obey only Davros.
DAVROS: He is simply buying time. Do as he says.
DOCTOR: Do as he says.
DALEK 2: We obey.
DOCTOR: I believe this is what's called a Mexican stand-off.
DAVROS: Ha. How long do you think you can sustain your advantage, alone and against such odds.
DOCTOR: Ha, ha. Wouldn't you like to know, eh? Wouldn't you like to know?
DOCTOR: Wouldn't I like to know.
SHARREL: What's happened?
ROMANA: The Doctor, he needs help. Where did you get that picture? How do you know about Davros?
SHARREL: We have our means. Mobilise unit five. You will remain here.
DALEK: Attention, attention. The action we are about to take is your responsibility. It will cease only when you agree to total surrender.
DOCTOR: Now what?
DALEK: Exterminate.
DALEK: Exterminate.
DALEK: Exterminate!
DOCTOR: Stop!
DALEK: You surrender?
DOCTOR: All right. All right. You can have Davros, but only on my conditions.
DALEK: State them.
DOCTOR: All slave workers to be released immediately and allowed to leave the city.
DALEK: Continue.
DOCTOR: Nothing to come in here until I'm out and in the clear.
DALEK: Conditions unacceptable. Exterminations will continue.
DOCTOR: Stop! One more killing and I detonate the device. I'll destroy Davros.
DALEK: Logic unacceptable. Detonation would also destroy you.
DOCTOR: Yes, you hadn't foreseen that one, had you.
DALEK: Self-sacrifice illogical, therefore impossible. Exterminations will continue.
DAVROS: Agree. Agree to his terms. He will do what he says. His logic is impaired by irrational sentiment. Agree. I, Davros, command it.
DALEK: We obey.
DALEK: The workers have been released.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now, I'll need one minute to get clear. Get back! I told you this was life insurance. I've adapted the device to explode by remote control.
DOCTOR: All I have to do is squeeze my sonic screwdriver and boom, boom, Davros.
DAVROS: You need not elaborate, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Just so long as you've got it clear.
DAVROS: We'll meet again, Doctor. Never doubt it. We'll meet again.
DOCTOR: Don't you be so sure.
DALEK: Exterminate the prisoners.
DAVROS: Quickly, the explosive. He will detonate.
DAVROS: Remove the explosive!
DALEK: We obey.
DAVROS: Come. There is much to be done. You must tell me of all the victories the Daleks have won whilst I have slept. And all the defeats. I shall learn from your mistakes. The Daleks shall be made into perfect creatures. They will be invincible! The Daleks will rule the universe!
ROMANA: Oh yes, the Doctor knows more about the Daleks than anyone.
SHARREL: He is an expert in robotics?
ROMANA: An absolute genius.
SHARREL: You'll be safer here. You will stay.
ROMANA: But you're dead.
SHARREL: Emission power?
AGELLA: Level three. Consciousness will not return for some time.
SHARREL: Prepare the Nova device. We must be ready to destroy this planet as soon as we've secured our new objective, the Doctor.
DALEK: Seek and locate. Seek and locate.
DALEK 3: We obey.
DOCTOR: Oh, a Kaled mutant. Of course. The Dalek's were originally organic lifeforms. I think you've just told me what the Daleks want with Davros, haven't you.
TYSSAN: Doctor. Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tyssan.
TYSSAN: I've been looking for you. It's hard to move around, though. There are Dalek patrols everywhere.
DOCTOR: Yes, so I've seen.
TYSSAN: I found the other prisoners. They told me what you'd done to free them. They're very grateful.
DOCTOR: Oh, it was nothing, nothing. Where are they now?
TYSSAN: Hiding. If we can lay our hands on some weapons, I'm hoping to turn them into some sort of fighting force.
DOCTOR: That could be very useful, Tyssan.
DALEK: Remain where you are. You will turn and walk ahead of me. If you make any attempt to escape you will be extermi 
DOCTOR: Awfully decent of you. Very grateful.
CASSANDRA: You will accompany me back to our spacecraft.
DOCTOR: Well, all in good time. There are a few things I want to do first.
CASSANDRA: That is not a request. It is an order. Move!
DOCTOR: I do seem to be in demand today. Come on, Tyssan.
TYSSAN: What the devil? Why did she turn against you?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure she was ever for me.
TYSSAN: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Just as I thought. Just another race of robots, no better than the Daleks.
LAN: Ready.
LAN: Make sure the seals are tight. Right, move back.
MOVELLAN: How does it work?
LAN: It changes the molecular structure of the atmosphere. The atoms become flammable. If the Nova device was activated outside the protective shielding, the atmosphere surrounding this planet would burn up in seconds.
AGELLA: Lan reports the Nova device functions perfectly.
SHARREL: Excellent. Unfortunately, our attempts to capture the Doctor have failed so far. What we need is some way to get him out into the open. Take her.
DOCTOR: Tyssan, get back out of sight.
Episode Four
SHARREL: Malfunction.
AGELLA: No, I didn't arm the device. It seemed unnecessary as we merely wanted to draw the Doctor into the open.
SHARREL: Very well. Take her. You two, take him.
DAVROS: Advise Dalek Central Control in space that I require immediate transportation.
DALEK: It has been done. A deep space cruiser is on its way.
DAVROS: When will it reach Skaro?
DALEK 2: Estimated arrival time, six hours.
DAVROS: Six hours? Too long. Every moment we remain on Skaro we are vulnerable to attack. All operational Daleks to remain on maximum alert until I am aboard the cruiser and safely in space. Maximum alert.
DALEK: As you command.
DAVROS: My safety is to be your primary concern. You will make any sacrifice that is required to protect me.
DALEK: I obey.
DAVROS: Very well. Now, you have a computer sphere containing the logistics and status of the Dalek battle fleet.
DALEK: It contains every detail of the situation.
DAVROS: Bring it to me.
DALEK: The information was checked and supervised by the Supreme Dalek.
DAVROS: Supreme Dalek. Pah. That is a title I shall dispute most vigorously. I created the Daleks. It is I who will guide their destiny. I am the Supreme Commander!
DALEK: You will be obeyed.
DAVROS: Excellent. Now I wish to concentrate. Leave me.
DALEK: I obey.
AGELLA: Motors are running up. Chargers operating in full capacity. We will have launch power in thirty two minutes.
SHARREL: Commence lift-off countdown. Is the device reset?
LAN: Yes. Commander, I think it wise that the device be activated manually. If it is left on automatic, the Daleks may find it and destroy it. It must be guarded to the very last moment.
SHARREL: Yes.
LAN: The operator will be destroyed, of course.
SHARREL: Necessary. You will perform this function, Lan.
LAN: Yes, Commander.
SHARREL: Take the device to the designated location. Report when you are in position, then stay with the device. Detonate on my radio command.
LAN: Understood.
DOCTOR: Robots! Of course!
SHARREL: Welcome back, Doctor.
DOCTOR: One race of robots fighting another. Is she going to be all right?
SHARREL: She'll recover.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
SHARREL: Tell me, Doctor, when did you first realise we were robotic?
DOCTOR: The night the roof fell in on Agella. 
AGELLA: Agella. 
DOCTOR: Agella, yes, how's your hand?
SHARREL: Disfunction or death, as you know it, only occurs in us with massive circuitry disturbance. We are infinitely superior.
DOCTOR: Are you really?
SHARREL: We function logically.
DOCTOR: My condolences to you.
SHARREL: Why, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Because you'll never defeat the Daleks. Let me demonstrate. Romana?
ROMANA: Yes?
DOCTOR: Are you feeling all right?
ROMANA: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. We're going to play a game. Now.
DAVROS: A concise report and a fascinating problem. The Daleks have met a foe worthy of their powers. Another race of robots.
DALEK: Correct. Dalek superiority will ultimately triumph and the Movellan force will be exterminated.
DAVROS: You have been fighting them for centuries, and still you are not victorious!
DALEK: It is only a matter of time.
DAVROS: No. Two gigantic computerised battle fleets locked together in deep space, hundreds of galactic battle cruisers vying with each other for centuries, and not a shot fired?
DALEK: Our computers are planning the moment of maximum advantage.
DAVROS: And so are theirs. It will never come. You have reached a logical impasse.
DALEK: Understood.
DAVROS: So that is why you have returned to find your creator.
DALEK: You will reprogramme our battle computers for us. The Movellans will be exterminated!
DOCTOR: Paper wraps stone.
ROMANA: Ha, stone blunts scissors.
DOCTOR: Scissors cuts paper. Ha, ha! But suppose we were two computers controlling two great battle fleets, each one working perfectly logically to outmanoeuvre the other. Well, you're robots, you try it.
SHARREL: We're perfectly
DOCTOR: Try it! Go on.
DOCTOR: Ha! You see? You're caught in an impasse of logic. You've discovered the recipe for everlasting peace. Congratulations. I'm terribly pleased.
SHARREL: Our objective is victory, Doctor. The destruction of the Dalek fleet.
DOCTOR: You play with me, eh? Come on.
SHARREL: Paper.
DOCTOR: Scissors cuts paper.
SHARREL: Stone.
DOCTOR: Paper wraps stone.
SHARREL: Scissors.
DOCTOR: Stone blunts scissors. Again. Scissors cuts paper.
SHARREL: Stone.
DOCTOR: Paper wraps stone.
SHARREL: Scissors.
DOCTOR: Stone blunts scissors.
SHARREL: Thank you, Doctor. Our battle computers must have a new element programmed into them. An advantage, however small, that will change the balance of power. You.
ROMANA: And the Daleks want the same thing.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SHARREL: When we reach the fleet, you will reprogramme our computers.
DOCTOR: I will?
AGELLA: Yes. The Dalek fleet will be wiped from the heavens and nothing will stand in our way of the conquest of the galaxy.
DOCTOR: No, you've overlooked something. Suppose I was willing to help you to change the balance of power, which I'm not, Davros will be doing exactly the same things for the Daleks. I mean, he may be mad, but his computer skills are almost as great as mine.
SHARREL: That is precisely why we're taking you with us, Doctor. When we're safely in space, the Nova device will detonate and destroy Davros. With your skills, the impasse will be broken.
TYSSAN: Now, this bit here and this bit here. Good.
TYSSAN: Now, let's see if the Doctor's right.
DALEK: Report.
DALEK 2: Surface scans indicate the Movellan ship is preparing for launch.
DALEK: Estimated time to lift-off?
DALEK 2: Twenty one minutes. Report continues. Listening scanners have detected non-Movellan voices inside the space vehicle. Computers identify the voices as those of the Doctor and his companion.
DAVROS: They must be stopped. The Doctor could reprogramme the Movellan battle computers. He would counteract my advantage. The Movellan ship must be destroyed.
DALEK: Our firepower will be ineffective against its hull.
DAVROS: Then we need more than firepower. Unpack the explosives.
ROMANA: Scissors cuts paper.  Let's get out.
DOCTOR:  Yes.  Paper wraps stone.  How?
ROMANA: Stalemate.  Do something.
DOCTOR:  When I give the signal, move.
DOCTOR: Stone blunts scissors.
ROMANA: Good plan. Scissors cuts paper. Paper wraps
DOCTOR: Jelly baby.
ROMANA: Jelly baby?
DOCTOR: Doctor catches robot.
AGELLA: Commander, Lan is not answering my signals.
SHARREL: Go out and check he's still in position.
AGELLA: At once.
SHARREL: Launch programme.
TYSSAN: Well done, Lan.
DAVROS: Now, understand me clearly. You will not deviate from your objective no matter what the provocation. Let no opposition halt you. When you reach the Movellan space vehicle, position yourselves around the ship as close as possible to the hull. The sacrifice you make will ensure total Dalek victory in the space war! Carry out your orders!
DALEK 2: We obey.
DAVROS: Total Dalek victory. Then on to still greater conquests. I will lead. Davros will lead!
DOCTOR: Don't you ever speak to me like that again, you understand? Never!
ROMANA: What did I say?
DOCTOR: Jelly baby! You keep out of this. It's a personal matter, isn't it.
ROMANA: Yes.
DOCTOR: So just mind your own business.
ROMANA: You tell him.
DOCTOR: And you mind your own business, too.
ROMANA: What?
DOCTOR: Duck!
DOCTOR: Oh well, so much for logic. A mind that can be scrambled by a dog whistle.
ROMANA: These are Movellan minds?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, not quite. They're just power packs with some main circuits.
ROMANA: Orders for the day and the power to carry them out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it. Tyssan! Tyssan. Well done, Tyssan. Any news of Davros?
TYSSAN: Nothing.
DOCTOR: The Daleks will be sending a ship for him. We mustn't let him get away.
TYSSAN: We've only got a handful of men. How can we stop him?
DOCTOR: One, two, three, four, five. I'll go alone. Ask me why.
TYSSAN: Why?
DOCTOR: They're unconscious. Also I'm a very dangerous fellow when I don't know what I'm doing. You stay here, Tyssan. You'll need this ship to get home. Romana, you help him.
DOCTOR : I will return!
DALEK 2: Do not deviate. All units proceed as ordered. The space vehicle must be destroyed.
DOCTOR:  Davros. Davros!  Davros.
DAVROS: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hello. I didn't think getting to see you would have been so easy. Are you just going to sit there quietly and wait for the Dalek ship to pick you up?
DAVROS: I have one more thing to do before I leave. It seems we have both been much in demand, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, it's nice to be wanted, isn't it.
DAVROS: Putting aside our differences for a moment.
DOCTOR: Oh?
DAVROS: Speaking simply as scientists, the problem is fascinating, don't you agree?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, two vast computers so evenly matched they can't out-think one another.
DAVROS: Two spacefleets totally impotent.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DAVROS: You know how the stalemate can be broken, of course.
DOCTOR: Oh, of course.
DAVROS: I realised you would. So obvious but they can't see it. Would you have told the Movellans?
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
DAVROS: I suspected you wouldn't.
DOCTOR: Would you have told the Daleks?
DAVROS: But I dared not take the risk. I had to stop them taking you.
DOCTOR: But you failed. The prisoners set me free.
DAVROS: The Movellan ship will never lift off! Soon my Daleks, carrying more than half a megaton of explosives, will press against the hull and I will simply activate this control to detonate.
DOCTOR: Really. And how will you stop me activating that control before they reach their target?
DAVROS: I would not.
DOCTOR: Really?
DALEK: Do not move.
DAVROS: You see, there's nothing you can do to stop it now.
DALEK 2: Let no opposition halt you. Advance for total Dalek victory! Objective sighted. Advance!
TYSSAN: Well, we got them all.
ROMANA: Was Commander Sharrel with them?
TYSSAN: No. I thought he was up here.
ROMANA: Well, I can't find him.
TYSSAN: Oh, it's not important. Even if he got away, he can't do much on his own.
ROMANA: The Nova device! He'll try to detonate!
DALEK 2 : Now commencing final approach to ship.
DAVROS: Very soon now, Doctor. Very soon.
DALEK 2: Do not deviate. Let no opposition halt you.
TYSSAN: Right, there's a Dalek force coming. Now pick up what weapons you can. We've got to hold them.
DALEK 2: Exterminate!
DAVROS: When the Dalek ship arrives, you will accompany us.
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sure they'll welcome me with open arms. I mean, they would welcome me with open arms if they had arms. Please, please, no offence meant at all.
DALEK: Malfunction.
DAVROS: Behind you.
DALEK: Malfunction.
DAVROS: Behind you.
DALEK: Visual circuit is impaired.)
DAVROS: To your right. To your left.
DALEK: Malfunction.
DAVROS: To your right. This way!
DALEK: Malfunction.
DAVROS: Not me, you fool!
DALEK: Vision impaired! Vision impaired! Malfunction! Loss of visual control. Malfunction! Malfunction!
DALEK: Malfunction! Loss of control! Loss of control! Loss of control!
DOCTOR: Bye, bye.
DOCTOR: My hat!
DAVROS: Keep away.
DOCTOR: What?
DAVROS: Keep back.
DOCTOR: All elephants are pink. Nellie is an elephant, therefore Nellie is pink. Logical?
DAVROS: Perfectly.
DOCTOR: You know what a human would say to that?
DAVROS: What?
TYSSAN: Elephants aren't pink.
DAVROS: Bah. Humans do not understand logic.
ROMANA: They're not slaves to it like the Daleks or the Movellans.
DOCTOR: That's why the Daleks came back for you. They remembered they were once organic creatures themselves, capable of irrational, intuitive thought, and they wanted you to give it back to them to get them out of their trap of logic.
DAVROS: I have failed!
DOCTOR: Yes. What does it feel like?
DAVROS: What will happen to me?
TYSSAN: A high security ship has started out from Earth to meet us. You will be taken to stand trial for your crimes against the whole of sentient creation.
DAVROS: There is not a ship, not a prison that can hold me!
DOCTOR: No, but I think this little device can. It's a cryogenic freezer. Even you can't escape from a solid block of ice. Bye, bye, Davros.
TYSSAN: Doctor! Doctor!
DOCTOR: That was a narrow escape. Come on, we've got some digging to do.
ROMANA: Doctor, could you really have solved their problems and won the war for them?
DOCTOR: Of course I could. It's obvious.
ROMANA: Was it?
DOCTOR: Yes. Both sides were fighting with computers, perfectly logically. Each computer could predict the move of the other and counter it. Result, stalemate.
ROMANA: So the first side that switches its computer off and does something irrational
DOCTOR: Wins the battle, yes. Make mistakes and confuse the enemy.
ROMANA: Brilliant.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ROMANA: Is that why you always win?
DOCTOR: Yes. What?
ROMANA: Because you always make mistakes.
DOCTOR: Mistakes? Me? Well, perhaps once a century or so.
DOCTOR : Well, I have made the odd mistake.
ROMANA : Not that switch.
DOCTOR : What?
DOCTOR : Oh, yes.
