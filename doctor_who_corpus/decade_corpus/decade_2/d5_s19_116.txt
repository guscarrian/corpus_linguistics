Castrovalva
Part One
NYSSA: Doctor.
TEGAN: Doctor.
ADRIC: Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's the end. But the moment has been prepared for.
ADRIC: The Watcher.
NYSSA: So he was the Doctor all the time.
DOCTOR: I. Oh.
SECURITY: These are secure premises! Now you lot have got some explaining to do.
TEGAN: But the Doctor
SECURITY: He'll be taken care of.
ADRIC: Look, will you let me go!
TEGAN: Look, take your hands off me. This is an official uniform!
NYSSA: Leave me alone!
ADRIC: Now, don't be silly. We would like to help you, but we can't just leave the Doctor. Something might've gone wrong with his regeneration.
SECURITY: Hands up and lean on it. Come on, quick!
GUARD: There you go.
TEGAN: We're perfectly harmless, unfortunately.
ADRIC: I thought the whole point of this Pharos Project of yours was to track down alien intelligences. We thought we'd save you the trouble and come to you.
SECURITY: Oh yes?
ADRIC: Yes. We're what you've been looking for. Alien intelligences. You see I come from somewhere up there. That is the way into E-space.
NYSSA: Adric, quick!
SECURITY: Get him!
ADRIC: Get off me!
TEGAN: Get the Doctor, quick!
SECURITY: I'll hold him. Get the two girls!
NYSSA: This works the door. That's all I know about these controls.
TEGAN: We can't take off without Adric. Doctor! Where's he off to now?
SECURITY: Right, young man, you better come along with me.
ADRIC: Look, I hope you realise the Doctor's just saved us all from the Master, and now he's going to take off and you'll never have a chance to
NYSSA: Tegan!
TEGAN: What's the matter?
NYSSA: The Master's Tardis.
TEGAN: Adric! Adric, where are you?
TEGAN: I suppose we'd better take off or something.
TEGAN: I hope he knows what he's doing.
NYSSA: He took off once before, he said, but that was by mistake.
NYSSA: Good takeoff.
TEGAN: The Doctor's very strange.
NYSSA: He's weak. It's the shock.
TEGAN: Well, you'd better go talk to him, because I don't understand this scientific stuff. He's looking for something called a Zero Room.
ADRIC: Zero Room? I'll go.
TEGAN: That boy never even said thank you.
DOCTOR: Ah. You've come to help me find the Zero Room. Welcome aboard. I'm the Doctor. Or will be if this regeneration works out.
NYSSA: I suppose this is the mean free path tracker. And this panel must be a referential difference.
TEGAN: I know the Tardis is huge, but it can't be taking them this long, surely. What's a Zero Room anyway? The Doctor said something about null interfaces.
NYSSA: I suppose it's some sort of neutral environment. An isolated space cut off from the rest of the universe.
TEGAN: He should've told me that's what he wanted. I could've shown him Brisbane.
DOCTOR: Now, ordinary spaces, of course, show up on the architectural configuration indicators, but any good Zero Room is balanced to zero energy with respect to the world outside its four walls. Or however many walls it has.
DOCTOR: There was a very good polygonal Zero Room under the Junior Senate block on Gallifrey, widely acclaimed for it's healing properties. Romana's always telling me I need a holiday.
ADRIC: But Romana's gone, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Gone? Really? Did she leave a note?
ADRIC: We said goodbye to her at the gateway. Don't you remember?
DOCTOR: Well, if we did, we did.
DOCTOR: This should get you back to the console room when the time comes.
ADRIC: Are you sure you're alright?
DOCTOR: There are strong dimensioning forces this deep in the Tardis. Tend to make one a bit giddy.
ADRIC: And the regeneration?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I can feel it isn't going to be as smooth as on other occasions. Sooner we get to this Zero Room place, the better, eh?
NYSSA: These mechanisms are too complex. We just can't fly the Tardis without the Doctor's help.
TEGAN: What if we don't get it? Anything could've happened to him and Adric.
NYSSA: Then the Tardis will just fly on and on, until it crashes into something.
TEGAN: Crash? Is that likely?
NYSSA: Inevitable. The star densities in this galaxy vary inversely with the square
TEGAN: Oh, rabbits!
NYSSA: Tegan, I don't know what's happening to the Doctor, none of us understands it but, I do know that panicking is no use.
TEGAN: You're right. Well, if only we had a manual.
NYSSA: There's nothing we can do here. I'm going to try and find them.
TEGAN: Wait! You don't know those corridors. I got lost in them when I first came into the Tardis and I can tell you they're a nightmare.
NYSSA: Then you'd better stay here.
TEGAN: I'll come with you.
TEGAN: Wait a minute!
TEGAN: Tardis Information System. Ready For Entry.
NYSSA: A databank!
DOCTOR: I left a waistcoat like that on. Ever been to Alzarius?
ADRIC: I was born there, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Really? It's a small universe, isn't it.
DOCTOR: I wonder, boy, what would you do if you were me, hmmm? Or perhaps I should ask, what would I do if I were me.
TEGAN: Will it tell us how to fly the Tardis?
NYSSA: I'm sure that's in here somewhere, once we find the index file.
TEGAN: How do we find the index file? Of course, if we had an index file, we could look it up in the index file, under index file. What am I saying? I'm talking nonsense.
NYSSA: Recursion isn't nonsense.
TEGAN: Eh?
NYSSA: That's an example of recursion, when procedures fold back on themselves. If you had an index file, you could look it up in the index file.
TEGAN: If. My Dad used to say that if was the most powerful word in the English language.
NYSSA: Recursion's a powerful mathematical concept, but I don't see how it can help us now.
TEGAN: If. I F! Stands for index file!
DOCTOR: Not far now, Brigadier, if the Ice Warriors don't get there first. Oh no. Oh dear. We've wandered into the wrong corridor. We must be close to the main Tardis drive now. Jamie. Jamie, you go back.
ADRIC: No. I have to stay with you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, nonsense, be sensible, go back! When I say run, run! Don't you understand? The regeneration is failing.
TEGAN: I F! It works. Let me have a go on it.
NYSSA: Look up destination setting.
TEGAN: Right. D S. You know, once you get into it, this whole funny system on the Tardis does start to make a sort of weird sense. Except this.  Tardis Flight Data. Programmed Journey. Departure Earth, Pharos Project. Destination Hydrogen In Rush, Event One.
DOCTOR: Adric! Adric, not that way! Adric. I remembered his name.
TEGAN: Seems the old doc is coming unraveled in more ways than one. Look, you'd better go back to the console room.
NYSSA: We're on a programmed flight. We won't crash. At least I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Adric!
DOCTOR: That's the trouble with regeneration. You never quite know what you're going to get.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Ah! Dear me. Needs a drop of linseed oil though.
TEGAN: No, that looks like the end of the trail.
NYSSA: This part of the Tardis can't have been used for centuries.
TEGAN: It does go on and on.
NYSSA: Deeper and deeper.
TEGAN: Yes, I get that feeling too, that we're going downwards.
MASTER [OC: Oh, no, you can't escape. You're mine, Adric. Mine! Until we have completed our final task.
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose I'll get used to it in time.
DOCTOR: That's it. That's the door!
NYSSA: This way, come on!
 
NYSSA: Doctor!
TEGAN: Thank heavens.
DOCTOR: The Zero Room door, I heard it slam.
TEGAN: Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Fit as a fiddle, Vicki, but something very peculiar is going on in the Tardis. The Zero Room. Have you seen it anywhere?
TEGAN: I think the noise came from this direction.
DOCTOR: Good. I'll follow you.
TEGAN: Must be around here somewhere.
TEGAN: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hello, carmine seepage.
TEGAN: Actually, Doctor, it's me. My lipstick. We passed this way before.
DOCTOR: Oh that's a relief, I thought the Tardis auto-systems were playing up again. Dreadful. Always going wrong. It's time we went to Logopolis to get it all sorted out once and for all.
TEGAN: We've been already, Doctor.
NYSSA: Doctor? What does the Zero Room look like?
DOCTOR: Zero Room? Oh, it's very big, empty, sort of grey. Pinkish-grey.
TEGAN: Come on, Doctor. Through this way.
DOCTOR: Thank you. You must be Tegan. Works even better if you close the doors, Nyssa.
TEGAN: It smells like roses.
DOCTOR: Yes. I've never quite understood why. It's quite peaceful, isn't it.
TEGAN: Peaceful. Doctor it's like
NYSSA: Like Traken used to be.
TEGAN: Will you have to stay here long?
DOCTOR: Oh, just until my dendrites heal.  The nervous system's a very delicate network of logic junctions.
NYSSA: The synapses, yes.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I was forgetting, Nyssa, bioelectronics is your strong point. Yes, well, my tussle with the Master came at precisely the wrong moment. When the synapses are weak they're like radio receivers, picking up all sorts of jumbled signals.
TEGAN: I get it. The Zero Room cuts out all interference.
DOCTOR: Completely! Even the gravity's only local. Goodness me, I'm tired.
NYSSA: But there isn't even a bed.
DOCTOR: Bed? Oh, I don't need a bed. Not in the Zero Room.
DOCTOR: One of the advantages of stark simplicity.
TEGAN: Can anybody do that?
DOCTOR: Oh, you don't do it. It just sort of comes to you, like sleep. Very like sleep. We only just made it to the Zero Room in time. 
DOCTOR : This regeneration is going to be difficult, and I shall need you all, every one of you. You, Tegan, you have it in you to be a fine coordinator, keeping us all together during the healing time. Nyssa, of course, has the technical skill and understanding. All the information you need is in the Tardis databank. I'm sure you can find your way to it.
TEGAN: We already have, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Good, good. Of course you have. And Adric, Adric with his badge for mathematical excellence. Adric is the navigator. He knows the way. He knows me, my old self. Adric, you must help me heal the disconnection. Your role is very crucial.
TEGAN: Adric.
NYSSA: Oh! Adric!
TEGAN: Adric. What are you doing up there?
ADRIC: A trap. He set a trap. The Master!
NYSSA: The Master? Where?
ADRIC: Me! I'm the trap. I locked the coordinates. Event One!
TEGAN: Adric, hold on. I'm coming up to get you.
ADRIC: No, no, this isn't me. It isn't me. It's an illusion. Projection! Block transfer. Tegan, the coordinates.
TEGAN: Horrible.
ADRIC: Escape. Must escape.
MASTER: So, these simulated projections are real enough to have a will of their own. Almost.
ADRIC: Can't, can't reach me in the Zero Room.
MASTER: Is that what you thought? Well, my dear young man, it's your own computational powers that made the block transfer possible. If escape were that easy, Adric, we could all be free of this nasty world. Now, we must save your energies. There's so much yet to be done.
NYSSA: We can't tell him now. He's in a dangerously unstable state.
TEGAN: Adric was trying to warn us.
NYSSA: The coordinates, and something about a trap. You stay here and keep an eye on the Doctor.
TEGAN: Where are you going?
NYSSA: Console room. Look after the Doctor.
NYSSA: That's odd.
TEGAN: Poor Adric. If only we could do something.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
TEGAN: Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
DOCTOR: There seems to be something distinctly wrong. I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Shush. The Tardis Cloister Bell. Imminent disaster.
TEGAN: For us?
DOCTOR: Oh, worse than that. The Tardis is in danger. Who's in the console room?
TEGAN: Nyssa.
DOCTOR: And Adric.
TEGAN: Adric's
DOCTOR: Well, is he, or isn't he?
TEGAN: Well, Doctor
TEGAN : No, you can't go out there.
DOCTOR: Adric isn't what? Tell me!
TEGAN: It doesn't matter.
TEGAN: Look, you stay here. I'll go. After all, I am the coordinator.
NYSSA:  Hydrogen. Abundant element. Highly explosive in the presence of oxygen. Believed to be the basic constituent out of which the galaxy was first
TEGAN: Oh, this heat. Has something gone wrong with the Tardis air-conditioning?
NYSSA: Of course, that's it. It's not the Tardis.
TEGAN: Well, what else could it be?
NYSSA: Outside! You'd better read this.
DOCTOR: I've got to do something.
TEGAN: Event One.
NYSSA: A trap, Adric said. This is a time machine.
TEGAN: And we're travelling backwards in time. Back to first event!
NYSSA: The creation of the galaxy out of a huge in-rush of hydrogen. We're heading straight into the biggest explosion in history!
MASTER: Farewell, my friends. Farewell forever!
Part Two
NYSSA: That face. I hate it!
TEGAN: We must do something.
NYSSA: There's only one thing we can do.
TEGAN: And?
NYSSA: That's all.
TEGAN: All? Hogwash. We found the databank. Maybe we'll learn how to fly the machine.
DOCTOR: Tablets. The mixture. The ointment.
ADRIC: No!
MASTER: You must control these dangerous emotions, Adric. They'll only cause you pain, besides interfering with the reception. Now, closer!
DOCTOR: The potion. The solution. Oh, my little friend, if only you were.
DOCTOR: Oh, transport of delight.
MASTER: You have something to say? Well?
ADRIC: I'll fight you. I won't let you harm the Doctor, I won't!
MASTER: Closer, Adric. I must see them.
DOCTOR: Go softly on!
NYSSA: You don't understand the physics of the situation. We're already caught in the field of Event One. It's pulling us in faster and faster.
TEGAN: A sort of gravity.
NYSSA: The time force. It's many orders of magnitude greater.
TEGAN: But people escape from gravity all the time. What we need is some kind of rocket thrust. All right, enormous thrust. But there must be some way the Tardis can do that.
NYSSA: But nothing's happening. The temperature's defeating the automatic controls.
TEGAN: Doctor!
NYSSA: You must go back.
DOCTOR: Smoke! Heat! And noise! Adrenaline! And neuropeptides! The brain's working!
TEGAN: Neuropeptides? What's he talking about?
NYSSA: The excitement's changing his biochemistry. It's only temporary but perhaps he can help us.
TEGAN: We must take him back. It's not safe.
NYSSA: But the Doctor's our only chance, unless we can find some way of getting the temperature down.
DOCTOR: The manual override, Nyssa. I'll have to explain how to vent the thermo-buffer. Listen very carefully. My concentration may go again at any moment.
ADRIC: Doctor.
MASTER: I sympathise. This is all too easy. A great pity. These facile victories only leave me hungry for more conquest.
DOCTOR: This will be simpler, of course, if you go into hover mode first, always remembering of course not to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow. The whole system is on manual now. This is where it starts to get really dangerous.
TEGAN: Not till now?
DOCTOR: The temperature will start coming down fairly quickly, but without that stimulus my neuropeptide level will fall to normal.
TEGAN: Don't worry, Doctor. We'll get you straight back to the Zero Room.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Now, as soon as full console functions are restored, you can start to reprogram the architectural configuration. I'd better show you.
DOCTOR: Er.
TEGAN: But how will it help to change the Tardis rooms around?
DOCTOR: Oh, the architectural configuration system can do more than that. We can actually delete rooms.
TEGAN: Delete them? You mean zap?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Zap! Enough zap and you have your thrust. Now, follow this very carefully.
TEGAN: You bet your life.
MASTER: Perhaps this little demonstration will give you some glimpse of my real power.
ADRIC: Power you're getting from me! From my computations!
MASTER: In part, certainly. Even as an enemy, you're useful. But how much more useful as an ally.
DOCTOR: Now, have you got that?
TEGAN: Yes. We're converting the mass of the deleted Tardis rooms into momentum. But I still don't understand about momentum.
DOCTOR: Mass in motion. Thrust, if you like. Time for lessons later.
TEGAN: Does it mean burning up part of the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't worry, it works. We had to do that once with Adric to get away from. By the way, where is Adric?
TEGAN: Adric? He's er
DOCTOR: Well, where? We need him!
NYSSA: It's cooler already. That's something.
DOCTOR: Well?
NYSSA: Adric's not here, Doctor. You see
TEGAN: We thought he was in the Zero Room.
DOCTOR: Well, tell me later. There's not much time. Once the star field reaches critical mass, we'll be shut into the in-rush. Where were we, Jo? Deleting rooms.
NYSSA: But Adric.
TEGAN: Are you okay, Doctor?
NYSSA: His adrenaline's normalising. It was helping to bridge the synapses.
DOCTOR: Shush. Come on, we've got to finish this. Seventeen thousand tons of thrust. Say twenty five percent of the architecture.
TEGAN: A whole quarter of the Tardis?
NYSSA: Which twenty five percent, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Doesn't matter, same thrust.
NYSSA: No, it isn't. We don't want to jettison the console room.
TEGAN: That's a thought. Doctor, please. One last thing.
DOCTOR: Yes?
NYSSA: How do we make sure we don't jettison the console room?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. That's the trouble with manual override.
NYSSA: What's the problem?
DOCTOR: Get K9 to explain it to you. Good luck.
TEGAN: Thanks, Doc. I think we might need it.
MASTER: Well, Adric, this is my proposition. Life will immediately become more comfortable for you if you join forces with me. Or do you prefer to remain in the web throughout eternity. A mere utility. You may speak.
ADRIC: What do you want me to do?
TEGAN: It seems so still now.
NYSSA: We've passed the boundary layer. We're heading straight towards the in-rush. Thirty eight seconds.
TEGAN: How can you be so calm? We're playing Russian roulette with the Tardis.
NYSSA: Thirty one seconds.
TEGAN: If I press that button it could be the console room we jettison!
NYSSA: If. You taught me something. As a scientist it's easy to be tyrannised by facts.
TEGAN: If can work. But I didn't know it'd be this chancy.
NYSSA: Because it is still an if. You have to turn the if into a fact. Five seconds, four, three, two, one.
MASTER: So, this petty feud with the Doctor is over, Adric. You were wise to join me.
ADRIC: You've got to keep your side of the bargain.
MASTER: But are you truly sincere? I sense a barrier behind your eyes. Are you keeping something from me?
ADRIC: How could I?
MASTER: The universe is purged of the Doctor and his impossible dreams of goodness. You and I belong to the future.
ADRIC: The Doctor was doomed. I see that now.
MASTER: He might've escaped from the in-rush. Yes, even that was a possibility. But I had installed a trap behind that trap that would have been a joy to spring.
ADRIC: Yet another trap?
MASTER: A journey back in time. Long awaited. Why are you so curious?
MASTER: Residual voltage? You're receiving an image! What are you concealing from me? Some distant event beyond the range of my own scanner? I'll burn through your barrier, boy. Bring it to me!
ADRIC: No. No!
MASTER: It can't possibly be.
TEGAN: All Time Lords regenerate according to this databank. You'd think there'd be something in here about what to do when it goes wrong.
NYSSA: We must get him straight back to the Zero Room.
TEGAN: Wait a minute.  Ambient complexity is the cause of many of these failures of regeneration. Some real locations are known to have properties similar to Zero environments and, in some cases, are eminently more effective.
NYSSA: That's it. We need to take him somewhere uncomplicated. Somewhere away from technology.
TEGAN:  Classic Plainness as exemplified by regions like Dwellings of Simplicity.
NYSSA: Dwellings of Simplicity. Castrovalva. Where's that?
MASTER: Closer, boy. I must see him, hear him.
ADRIC: No. No!
MASTER: So, Doctor, you have survived. But at what cost, I wonder.
DOCTOR: Castrovalva.
NYSSA: The data bank is certain it's the best place to recuperate. It's in Andromeda. A small planet of the Phylox series.
DOCTOR: How do we get there?
NYSSA: Don't worry, Doctor. Tegan thinks she's learnt how to set the coordinates.
DOCTOR: Are you sure?
NYSSA: Well, that's what she said.
DOCTOR: When the Tardis is on manual, you can't be certain of anything.
NYSSA: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: It's harder to fly than you think. I mean, you don't just flick a switch.
TEGAN: Castrovalva, here we come.
TEGAN: Please?
DOCTOR: So, this air hostess person's flying it, eh? Well I wish her the best of luck.
NYSSA: Seems you were wrong about Tegan's ability to fly the Tardis, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I don't think so.
NYSSA: Then who's controlling the ship?
DOCTOR: What? I don't know.
NYSSA: It must be Tegan.
DOCTOR: Can't be.
NYSSA: Don't you worry about it, Doctor.
TEGAN: Well, we are moving.
NYSSA: We'll soon have you safe. Here's the Zero Room.
DOCTOR: Jettisoned.
TEGAN: On zeroing the coordinate differential, automatic systems reactivate the real-world interface. See Main Door, The Opening Of. Not much here about landing procedure. Hope it's as simple as it seems.
DOCTOR: Handy little device, the sonic screwdriver. Got me out of a lot of scrapes.
NYSSA: What do I do with this?
DOCTOR: Unscrew the hinges! If you wouldn't mind.
TEGAN: Castrovalva. Landing procedures. Here's hoping.
NYSSA: Unscrewing the doors won't get us into the Zero Room, Doctor. It's gone. We burnt it up. Doctor, please. What do I do next?
TEGAN: Hmm. Well, we can't hang about here all day.
NYSSA: There's no way into the Zero Room, Doctor. It's gone. What do we do?
TEGAN: Touchdown! We've made it. We've made it!
DOCTOR: Well done, Nyssa. That's the idea. We make another Zero Room out of what's left.
TEGAN: Not up to CAA standard, but a landing's a landing! Castrovalva can't be far.
NYSSA: It looks very small, Doctor.
DOCTOR: And unlike the Tardis, it is very small.
TEGAN: Well, it's not far to go, anyway.
NYSSA: You've seen it?
TEGAN: It's an afternoon's walk away, more or less.
NYSSA: We'll be carrying the Doctor, don't forget.
DOCTOR: Oh, just the Zero Cabinet.
TEGAN: Eh?
DOCTOR: You won't feel my weight. I'll make it easy for you. I'll be levitating.
TEGAN: That's much better.
NYSSA: There's a whole room full of clothes if you want to change.
TEGAN: No, we should make a start. It's that way.
NYSSA: I still say we should get help from Castrovalva.
TEGAN: Why? He's no problem while he's levitating. We can roll him along in the chair.
NYSSA: Doctor? Doctor?
NYSSA: What happened?
DOCTOR: So sorry. Lost concentration for a moment. Very tired.
NYSSA: I really think we should get help.
DOCTOR: Please, there's not much time. Thank you.
TEGAN: Well done, Doctor.
NYSSA: Maybe it's that way.
TEGAN: I did see it and I'm sure it's that way.
NYSSA: I think he's got heavier.
TEGAN: I hope you're wrong. Come on, Doctor. Help us to help you.
NYSSA: Urgh.
TEGAN: Are you sure I can't give you a hand?
NYSSA: This is going to take a bit of molecular adjustment.
TEGAN: Oh, no. What are we going to do now?
NYSSA: Are you sure this is the right way?
TEGAN: It'd better be! You know, this thing is still getting heavier.
TEGAN: The old Doc's levitation's wearing a bit thin.
NYSSA: He's lost his concentration again.
NYSSA: If we don't find Castrovalva soon. Doctor?
TEGAN: Shall we take a peek at him?
NYSSA: Nobody can open this cabinet unless the Doctor wants it open. The internal interfaces are fused by strong force interaction and
TEGAN: Look! Castrovalva.
TEGAN: Never mind that. We've got to get help. 
NYSSA: Just in case.
TEGAN: It'll be night before we know it.
NYSSA: Still no way in.
RUTHER: And here is where you saw them? Mergrave must be told this.
TEGAN: Castrovalva's harder to get into than the Doctor's cabinet.
NYSSA: Well, perhaps we should get back there. We might be able to wake him.
TEGAN: How? We can't get into him.
NYSSA: Well, we'll have to think of something. It does seem the only way.
NYSSA: Doctor?
TEGAN: Blood.
NYSSA: He's gone. The Doctor's gone!
Part Three
NYSSA: The cabinet was secure.
TEGAN: So he had to have opened it himself.
NYSSA: It must have worked. The Zero effect. He was feeling better.
TEGAN: Until whatever happened, happened. We've got to find him.
NYSSA: There's more blood here. And there, and there.
TEGAN: Castrovalva.
TEGAN: Run!
NYSSA: We've got to find the Doctor. Until he's properly regenerated he's terribly vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Twelve of them at least. War party, maybe.
NYSSA: There he is.
TEGAN: Perhaps he's found a way in.
NYSSA : Doctor!
NYSSA : Doctor!
DOCTOR: Doctor? Everyone's looking for him.
MERGRAVE: Once again we wait for Ruther. Was there ever a man with such capacity to lose both his quarry and himself?
RUTHER: This is another stranger.
MERGRAVE: Who are you, stranger?
DOCTOR: That's the strangest thing of all. I'm not entirely sure.
TEGAN: There. Come on.
MERGRAVE: Bring him.
NYSSA: Doctor!
TEGAN: Come back! Doctor!
RUTHER: I will give orders for the fire to be lit.
MERGRAVE: We will wait for Shardovan.
MERGRAVE: Well, sirs, today has been a good adventure in the wilds beyond the walls. And a quarry worth the name.
RUTHER: A fair kill, though I have seen better.
SHARDOVAN: If we could cook your memories, Ruther, we would feast indeed.
SHARDOVAN: I trust, Mergrave, you've brought us something more edible than this lifeless unfortunate?
NYSSA: Closed without a trace. If we had a three micron beam wedge though.
TEGAN: Well, we haven't.
NYSSA: I said if. You taught me about if, remember?
TEGAN: It's not that sort of if. It's what we can do, with what we've got, if only we used a bit of initiative. Come on.
MERGRAVE: We should inform the Portreeve of this man's arrival.
SHARDOVAN: That has been done. But not his purpose here. May one know that?
RUTHER: He says he doesn't know who he is, or why he has come.
SHARDOVAN: Oh, I admire a man with an open mind. My own is closed upon the opinion that I am Shardovan. I have the honour to be librarian for the dwellings of Castrovalva.
DOCTOR: Librarian? Books and stuff?
SHARDOVAN: Books are the principal business of a library, sir.
DOCTOR: Then you read? You all read?
MERGRAVE: Far too much, in my opinion. There is in this town of Castrovalva, sir, a general dedication to bodily inertia that quite defies description.
DOCTOR: Castrovalva? Yes, the place to rest.
RUTHER: Yes, and rest you shall, sir. Some refreshment, and then we must show you to your quarters.
DOCTOR: Definitely civilisation.
NYSSA: We'll never get up there.
TEGAN: Do you want to go back then?
NYSSA: We seem to be committed.
SHARDOVAN: I understand your natural puzzlement in the matter of our outdoor garments, sir. Mergrave has devised a new religion he calls exercise.
RUTHER: In pursuit of which belief, he drives us to hunt animals in the wilds beyond the walls.
DOCTOR: The hunt. Yes, it's all coming back to me. You weren't at the hunt.
SHARDOVAN: Alas, no.
RUTHER: Shardovan was detained by being longer in the body than the available habiliments could match.
SHARDOVAN: The garments with which we stir our courage to the hunt, sir, are relics of our ancestors, a smaller breed of men who, as I believe wore, down their stature with too much hunting. You will notice I am tall.
DOCTOR: I suppose that's why they made you librarian.
SHARDOVAN: Hmm?
DOCTOR: Reaching down the books from the top shelf.
MERGRAVE: The stranger is recovering his wits. A mild medicament, distilled from herbs.
DOCTOR: You're a doctor?
MERGRAVE: A master of physic, yes.
DOCTOR: Not the Doctor, I suppose? I came here to find him, I think.
RUTHER: It must be the Portreeve the stranger is in search of.
SHARDOVAN: The Portreeve, certainly. No one of us else is of the least importance.
DOCTOR: The Portreeve? A sort of magistrate?
SHARDOVAN: A man of great wisdom, sir. He reads thoroughly the books I merely rearrange. I'm sorry you will not dine with us tonight, but sleep. The meat served cold tomorrow will taste the better for it.
MERGRAVE: Good night, sir.
RUTHER: Good night.
DOCTOR: Yes, good night.
PORTREEVE: Drink. It's a simple to promote healing sleep.
DOCTOR: You're the Portreeve.
PORTREEVE: Shush. It's past my bed time. If they knew I was abroad, they would press me to this feast. For me, as for you sir, sleep is sometimes better nourishment than good red meat. Please drink, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good.
PORTREEVE: Excellent. You'll very soon find the Doctor.
DOCTOR: You overheard?
PORTREEVE: I know these things.
DOCTOR: Oh?
PORTREEVE: By the simplest of means. When you visit breakfast with me tomorrow, you will see the source of what my friends are pleased to call my great wisdom. Now sir, sleep.
DOCTOR: Yes, it has been a long journey. Tell me Portreeve, off the record, will I find the Doctor here?
PORTREEVE: Oh yes, Doctor, very soon.
DOCTOR: Good.
PORTREEVE: Good night, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good night.
DOCTOR: Doctor? Doctor.
NYSSA: We should have told the Doctor about Adric.
TEGAN: You said it was dangerous. He would have gone after him.
NYSSA: There might have been a chance, but now anything might have happened to the Doctor.
NYSSA: A rope ladder?
MERGRAVE: Shardovan! More strangers have arrived. They scaled the walls.
SHARDOVAN: A new sport to replace hunting. Where are these supermen?
MERGRAVE: They're coming. I must tell the Portreeve.
SHARDOVAN: No, wait.
TEGAN: The Doctor is here.
SHARDOVAN: They're women.
TEGAN: We saw him brought in.
NYSSA: We're looking for the Doctor.
RUTHER: This is most strange. The other visitor told us the same thing.
NYSSA: Other visitor? That must be
TEGAN: The Doctor. I demand to see him.
SHARDOVAN: Very well.
MERGRAVE: But you
SHARDOVAN: Then show them to their quarters. We will not disturb the Portreeve with this news. Old men need their sleep.
PORTREEVE: Some old men seldom sleep, Shardovan.
NYSSA: Is he all right?
MERGRAVE: Tomorrow, he will be recovered.
NYSSA: We have to tell him about Adric.
TEGAN: Are you sure? He's still not very strong.
NYSSA: We must. We have to think of Adric too. I know so little about telebiogenesis. If only there were some books here.
MERGRAVE: Come along.
WOMAN : Don't you worry
WOMAN 2 : Yes, well, women always have to
NYSSA: Wait! That belongs to the Doctor.
NYSSA: Thank you.
NYSSA: Adric!
ADRIC: No, don't turn around. Just listen, and listen quickly. The Master mustn't find me here.
NYSSA: He's in Castrovalva?
ADRIC: He can find me anywhere because I'm still in his power, but you mustn't let the Doctor know.
NYSSA: We have to tell him.
ADRIC: No, rescuing me can wait. Just listen. The Doctor must remain in Castrovalva until his regeneration is complete.
NYSSA: Wait, I must get Tegan.
ADRIC: No, you mustn't tell anybody you saw me. Nobody, you understand.
NYSSA: Doctor? DOCTOR: Nyssa. Lovely morning. I'm beginning to feel quite my old self. Or rather my new self.
ADRIC: No. No, I won't do it! I won't!
MASTER: But you've done it, boy. A perfect impersonation of yourself. Now we will remain untroubled by the Doctor's meddling while our plans mature.
DOCTOR: I like your Castrovalva, Portreeve. Very clever of them to have brought me here.
PORTREEVE: I fear we must be a little dull, after the habitual excitements you describe.
DOCTOR: Oh, the Ogrons and the Daleks and that. No, no, I think it does us good to be reminded the universe isn't entirely peopled with nasty creatures out for themselves.
SHARDOVAN: The volumes you asked for, Portreeve.
PORTREEVE: Ah, thank you Shardovan. I've finished with those.
SHARDOVAN: Ah, very well.
PORTREEVE: Let me introduce, Tegan and Nyssa, Shardovan the librarian.
NYSSA: There is a library.
SHARDOVAN: Which I hope you will visit.
NYSSA: I'd love to see it now.
PORTREEVE: Then you shall. There's something I want to show the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Whoever did this certainly has a way with needle and thread.
PORTREEVE: Remarkable, isn't it?
DOCTOR: This device you mentioned
PORTREEVE: It stands before you, Doctor. I've returned it to its state of yesterday, by way of demonstration.
NYSSA: Do you have any books on telebiogenesis?
SHARDOVAN: The technical section is not large, you will find, but you are welcome to browse.
DOCTOR: Fascinating demonstration, Portreeve. How often do the pictures renew themselves?
PORTREEVE: Life here in the main is very slow and unremarkable. Only an occasion, like your visit, disturbs the cycles enough to register on the tapestry.
DOCTOR: Some form of fast particle projection, I suppose.
PORTREEVE: Our forbears had many skills, now forgotten.
DOCTOR: Indeed.
PORTREEVE: Oh, there's no doubt some complexity behind it, but in view of what you told me you had better avoid such things until you are restored.
DOCTOR: You know, I had no idea I was putting them to so much trouble. It's a very long way for three young people to carry me.
PORTREEVE: Three, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. Er, Tegan, Nyssa and, er, Tegan. No, that's silly. Er, Nyssa, Tegan and Nyssa. Nyssa, Tegan. You know, I'm sure there's someone missing.
TEGAN: These aren't going to help us much with Adric.
NYSSA: A small technical section. There weren't any technical books at all.
TEGAN: Well, let's read the history of Castrovalva. Might tell us why.
NYSSA: Let's take them back to the Doctor's room.
DOCTOR: One, two. Good day. One, two. No, no, no, no.
DOCTOR: One, two.
CHILD: Three, sir.
DOCTOR: What?
CHILD: Three, sir, is what comes after two.
DOCTOR: Do you know, that's exactly what I thought.
CHILD: And then four and then five and then six and then seven
DOCTOR: Stop, please. You're making me dizzy. We'll have to give you a badge for mathematical excellence.  Adric. Adric!
TEGAN: The history of Castrovalva's fascinating.
DOCTOR: No time for that. Where is he?
TEGAN: Sorry?
DOCTOR: Adric!
TEGAN: You told him.
NYSSA: No, Adric told me not to.
DOCTOR: Adric told you?
TEGAN: Adric?
NYSSA: I'm, I'm so sorry, Doctor, but
DOCTOR: Please, never mind about the apologies. I think it's time I heard all about this.
SHARDOVAN: What, going so soon?
MERGRAVE: Whether for some offence we've given or just a sudden fancy, I cannot say.
SHARDOVAN: He cannot leave. He must not.
MERGRAVE: He seems firm in his intent.
SHARDOVAN: Then we must intervene.
DOCTOR: The Tardis.
NYSSA: The Zero cabinet.
DOCTOR: We can't go through all that again.
TEGAN: But once you get outside the walls
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to hope, won't we?
DOCTOR: Which is the quickest way out of here?
DOCTOR: Yes, well that's democracy for you. Come on.
NYSSA: I don't remember this.
DOCTOR: Never mind, come on. 
DOCTOR: I always did have a terrible sense of direction. Still as long we keep going down.
TEGAN: It's impossible!
RUTHER: Oh, I beg you, Doctor, reconsider this hasty departure.
MERGRAVE: For reasons of health, if not of courtesy.
DOCTOR: Sorry. No time. Must dash. Come back later. Where does this lead?
RUTHER: Out, sir, if you insist.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
TEGAN: That wretched square again. Doctor, what's happening?
DOCTOR: Shush. Concentrate. This could be serious.
NYSSA: It's as if space had folded in on itself.
DOCTOR: Very like it. Quick. There may still be time to reverse the sense!
SHARDOVAN: Doctor, what is the occasion of this haste?
NYSSA: It's affecting him, some very complex spatial disturbance.
TEGAN: What is it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Castrovalva, folding in on itself deliberately.
NYSSA: Come on, this way.
TEGAN: The Doctor's room.
NYSSA: Oh, thank goodness. We must get him back in the Zero cabinet immediately.
TEGAN: The Zero cabinet. It's gone.
DOCTOR: Recursive occlusion. Someone's manipulating Castrovalva. We're caught in a space-time trap!
Part Four
DOCTOR: I'm perfectly all right. We have got to find out what's causing the occlusion. Follow me!
DOCTOR: Please find the Zero Cabinet.
NYSSA: The Portreeve. He'll help us. Wait here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Be careful. If I'm right, the occlusion won't be dangerous to you at this moment. You're only trouble will be finding the way. Quickly!
RUTHER: You should prepare yourselves for disappointment. It is unusual for the Portreeve to grant two audiences on the same day.
TEGAN: Just take us to him.
DOCTOR: Must be about five hundred years old.
DOCTOR: Now that's odd. That's very odd indeed.
DOCTOR: Mergrave. Just the chap. There's something you can do for me.
TEGAN: That square again.
NYSSA: We keep coming back to it.
RUTHER: Of course.
TEGAN: But you must see that there's something going wrong here?
RUTHER: There are, as you have observed, steps that rise from the square and others that lead downwards from it, while other walks debouch laterally. An equitable arrangement, surely, allowing for much variety of movement.
TEGAN: You're not going to tell me you don't realise
RUTHER: Ah, there is an exemplary vista from here.
TEGAN: He must know. They're all in this together.
NYSSA: They would be if they were part of the recursion.
RUTHER: Here. Fine view down into the water tower.
NYSSA: Wait a minute.
NYSSA: Look.
TEGAN: What is it?
TEGAN: So that's where it got to.
MERGRAVE: Here are the other fifteen volumes. Put them down there.
DOCTOR: Well done, Margrave.
MERGRAVE: All right, run along.
DOCTOR: You know, I'm very fond of history, but I don't usually get much time for reading.
DOCTOR: No! Please. It's backed with silver. Helps to keep it out.
MERGRAVE: It? And what, sir, is it?
DOCTOR: Precisely what I'm trying to find out. Tell me, Mergrave, what do you see out of the window?
MERGRAVE: Well, sir, the town square, the library, the Portreeve's house and my own pharmacy. In fine, sir, the dwellings of Castrovalva.
DOCTOR: And it all makes sense to you?
MERGRAVE: Strange question. Shardovan has asked the same.
DOCTOR: Shardovan.
MERGRAVE: He too can be a little fevered in his imaginings. This will dispel your fatigue.
DOCTOR: How do I know you're telling the truth?
MERGRAVE: Because, sir, I maintain I am, and I am a man of my word.
DOCTOR: A perfect example of recursion, Mergrave. And recursion is exactly what we're up against. Draw me a square, large as you can.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, in the square, a rough map of Castrovalva.
TEGAN: You hid this deliberately.
SHARDOVAN: Assuredly, ma'am, no impropriety was intended.
TEGAN: You're all part of this. It's a conspiracy.
RUTHER: They have formed the suspicion that the Doctor has been ensnared.
SHARDOVAN: Ah. They cannot think that.
NYSSA: Come on. We must get this back to the Doctor straightaway.
DOCTOR: Now, the library, the square, the Portreeve's house. Now, where's your pharmacy?
MERGRAVE: Up here, sir. And down here. And round here. And along here also.
DOCTOR: Four pharmacies in a small place like this?
MERGRAVE: No, sir. I have but one.
DOCTOR: You positioned it four times.
MERGRAVE: It may be approached, sir, by many different routes.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Valeriana officinalis centiculare europea. And just a hint of rosemary.
MERGRAVE: You understand medicine, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not as well as you. But I'm afraid one of us is deluded about geography.
NYSSA: Doctor?
DOCTOR : Yes, yes, come in.
TEGAN: We found it, and no thanks to these Castrovalvan people. They kept leading us round and round and back to the square.
DOCTOR: Well, that's Castrovalva, not Ruther. I suppose you know the whereabouts of the Portreeve's house.
RUTHER: Nothing is more certain, sir.
DOCTOR: Well put. Show us on the map.
RUTHER: This is the Portreeve's house, along here, down there,  round there.
MERGRAVE: The Doctor has been explaining to me. I almost grasp it.
RUTHER: There is something amiss with the map.
DOCTOR: There is something amiss with Castrovalva, but because your perception is part of it, you cannot see it.
RUTHER: I am a rational man, sir. Explain this interesting idea.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm afraid that would take some doing.
NYSSA: Doctor, the Cabinet.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, in a minute. This library of Shardovan's, are all the books like this?
NYSSA: Yes, why?
DOCTOR: These volumes chronicle the rise of Castrovalva out of an alliance of warring hunters twelve hundred years ago. Or purport to chronicle.
MERGRAVE: Purport, you say?
RUTHER: That, sir, is our official history.
MERGRAVE: From Castrovalva's first beginnings to the present day.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm no expert, but I have the strongest possible hunch that these are forgeries.
RUTHER: What do you say, sir?
DOCTOR: Oh, the threads, the bindings, the paper, are as near the real thing as may be, but the contents are faked.
NYSSA: How can you tell?
DOCTOR: There is something we're all overlooking.
NYSSA: Yes? What, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I don't know. I'm overlooking it, too.
DOCTOR: But I'm certain the whole history's been invented.
TEGAN: By Shardovan.
NYSSA: But why? To hide something?
TEGAN: Something about the real history. Doctor?
DOCTOR: If there ever was a real history.
MERGRAVE: This noise is not acceptable.
MERGRAVE: The visitor is weaker, but receiving our best attention. But you must remain quiet as noise causes him great distress.
WOMAN:  Yes, okay.
RUTHER: This is Shardovan's hand. The librarian.
DOCTOR: Shardovan. I thought as much. I must see the Portreeve.
MERGRAVE: I'm sure, given your condition, the Portreeve will be happy to see you.
TEGAN: We'll carry him there.
MERGRAVE: As you wish.
TEGAN: Would you mind waiting outside?
NYSSA: We'll bring him out in a minute.
MERGRAVE: Never been treated like this before.
RUTHER: By a woman.
DOCTOR: One little suggestion.
MERGRAVE: I wish I could be of more help.
TEGAN: It's a complicated thing, this recursion business.
MERGRAVE: Please, let us have quiet here.
SHARDOVAN: Why are all these women here? Is this a holiday?
MERGRAVE: The Doctor is most unwell.
RUTHER: It's been agreed to carry him to the Portreeve. We must all help.
SHARDOVAN: Very well.
SHARDOVAN: Allow me to assist you.
TEGAN: No, keep away.
SHARDOVAN: Please, I insist I do my small part.
TEGAN: Excuse me. I am responsible for the Doctor.
MERGRAVE: This way.
TEGAN: The Doctor can't be levitating. He's so heavy.
TEGAN: Then?
NYSSA:  The history of Castrovalva.
TEGAN: What, all thirty volumes?
DOCTOR: You're the man I want.
SHARDOVAN: Explain yourself, sir.
DOCTOR: You're the only man here who could not be persuaded to join the hunting ritual.
SHARDOVAN: Ah. My natural indolence would not permit it.
DOCTOR: Your intelligence would not permit it. You suspected the whole tradition was invention from beginning to end and here's the proof. Your annotations of the histories.
SHARDOVAN: Ah. Mere fancies, sir. Notes for a fiction I had a mind to write.
DOCTOR: Hmm. The fiction of Castrovalva. A civilisation evolving out of tribal warfare into an ideal community. It is a fiction, and the thing that confirms it
SHARDOVAN: Well, sir?
DOCTOR: Oh, I know it. It's on the tip. It's on the tip of my mind. The books are five hundred years old at least, but
SHARDOVAN: The books are old, but they chronicle the rise of Castrovalva up to the present day.
MERGRAVE: Portreeve, the visitor's strange illness has progressed beyond my power to heal.
RUTHER: We have come for your help.
PORTREEVE: Please, not my help. This is a matter for the tapestry.
DOCTOR: Don't tell me you're lost, too?
SHARDOVAN: No, but as you guessed, Doctor, we people of Castrovalva are too much part of this thing you call the occlusion.
DOCTOR: But you do see it? The spatial anomaly.
SHARDOVAN: With my eyes, no. But in my philosophy. This way. I know a back way.
PORTREEVE: The Doctor has journeyed dangerously to honour us here in Castrovalva, and look at the outcome.
MERGRAVE: Portreeve, should we not begin?
PORTREEVE: Everything's in hand. With this tapestry and with patience, there's nothing one cannot achieve. Nothing, Doctor, in this world or in any other. The tapestry has the power to build and hold in space whole worlds of matter.
PORTREEVE: But I've contented myself with one small, simple town.
MASTER: For the final meeting of the Doctor with his Master! Bwahahahaha!
SHARDOVAN: Doctor.
DOCTOR: We must be very close to whatever he's using to power all this. Come on, we'll have to hurry. You're a good tall chap.
MASTER: I have waited patiently with this trap of mine. My Castrovalva.
NYSSA: But there is a real Castrovalva. It's mentioned in the Tardis databank.
MASTER: The boy Adric entered it there at my command.
NYSSA: Adric.
TEGAN: Where is he? What have you done with him?
MASTER: The boy is nothing. I want the Doctor. One long last look before I destroy him utterly.
NYSSA: You've got to stop him. He's the Master!
MASTER: What was that? Go on, find out.
The Doctor and Shardovan climb through the window onto a small balcony at the top of a flight of stairs.)
SHARDOVAN: Now, Doctor
DOCTOR: Shush!
MASTER: Open this for me!
NYSSA: Don't you understand anything about zero structures? The internal interfaces are bonded by strong-force interaction. The surfaces can only be separated from inside the Cabinet.
MASTER: Don't try to make a fool of me.
MERGRAVE: Doctor?
RUTHER: This is beyond all sense.
MERGRAVE: You must come along with us.
SHARDOVAN: No. You must spare the Doctor.
RUTHER: No, Shardovan. He has betrayed the Portreeve.
SHARDOVAN: My dear friends, it's we who've been betrayed.
DOCTOR: Listen carefully. This man you know as Portreeve is the most evil force in the universe. You have got to help me defeat him. Got to, do you understand?
SHARDOVAN: You do have doubts. We've spoken of it often.
DOCTOR: Well, say something, please!
SHARDOVAN: Shush.
DOCTOR: Yes would be best.
MASTER: I have you in my power absolutely, but I will see your face before I destroy you forever.
TEGAN: That wretched tapestry. He'll spot the Doctor any minute now.
MASTER: Well? Well, speak. I gave you tongues.
MERGRAVE: You are not the Portreeve.
MASTER: Someone's been tampering with your perception threshold.
RUTHER: You are not the Portreeve. I believe the visitor.
MASTER: A trick! The Doctor's here.
DOCTOR : Are you sure of that, Master?
MASTER: Enough of your deceptions!
MASTER: Where are you? I'll fetch you out wherever you are.
NYSSA: The tapestry, look!
TEGAN: But Doctor, it's
DOCTOR: I know, I know. Stay back.
DOCTOR: So that's how you're sustaining Castrovalva.
MASTER: My own adaptation of the block transfer computation. Since we last me, Adric's mathematical powers have been put to lively use.
DOCTOR: Deadly, you mean.
MASTER: That, too. You were wise to deter your young friends from approaching. The hadron power lines are lethal to the touch.
DOCTOR: All right, Master. It's me you want. Let the boy go.
MASTER: Yes, a trap has now been sprung. We can begin to dispose of all the bait.
DOCTOR: There was no call for that.
MASTER: I populated Castrovalva. I will dispose of these creatures as I choose.
DOCTOR: Unless you let every one of them go now
MASTER: Well, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Shardovan, get back!
MASTER: Don't touch the web. It's holding Castrovalva in balance. You do not have the will!
SHARDOVAN: You made us, man of evil, but we are free.
MASTER: My web!
MASTER: My web!
NYSSA: The Master! Look!
TEGAN: The fireplace. It's his Tardis.
NYSSA: Shardovan?
DOCTOR: He gave his life to help us.
TEGAN: The Master has escaped.
DOCTOR: So must we. Without the web to support it, the local space will fold up into itself. Come on!
NYSSA: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: It still makes sense to Mergrave. Stay behind him.
MERGRAVE: This way.
DOCTOR: The square again.
NYSSA: The Master's Tardis.
DOCTOR: It couldn't take off. Space is squeezing in too fast.
TEGAN: We're trapped.
NYSSA: How do we get out?
DOCTOR: It can't collapse without causing a breach somewhere.
MERGRAVE: There is nothing but confusion in my eyes now.
ADRIC: I can see.
DOCTOR: Adric created it. Which way?
ADRIC: What exactly am I looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Anything you don't recognise as Castrovalva.
ADRIC: Over there. The hillside.
DOCTOR: Follow Adric. Hold on to each other.
ADRIC: This is it. This is the way.
DOCTOR: Mergrave.
MASTER : My web!
MERGRAVE: Goodbye, Doctor.
MASTER: Bring it to me, boy. My web!
ADRIC: Doctor, quickly, we've got to leave before it closes again.
TEGAN: Doctor! Adric! Please hurry!
DOCTOR: Mergrave, we have got to leave.
MASTER: No! You can't beat me! Traitors!
NYSSA: It's gone. Gone forever.
ADRIC: And the Master?
DOCTOR: Let's hope so.
DOCTOR: One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. All right, rest. Deep breaths. Well done, Adric.
TEGAN: Why couldn't we just walk?
DOCTOR: Got to be fit to crew the Tardis. Trim Time Ship and a ship-shape team.
DOCTOR: Who landed this?
TEGAN: I did, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You flew the Tardis?
TEGAN: I followed the instructions in the computer.
DOCTOR: There aren't any.
TEGAN: But
DOCTOR: It was a projection.
NYSSA: As Adric was, in the Zero Room.
TEGAN: So I didn't fly it?
DOCTOR: Adric pre-programmed it. Whatever you did to the console, we'd have ended up at Castrovalva.
TEGAN: Oh, how disappointing.
DOCTOR: The Master leaves nothing to chance.
DOCTOR: Adric?
NYSSA: Are you sure you're up to flying the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Oh, I think so. In fact, I feel quite like my old self. Well. 
TEGAN: Yes?
DOCTOR: Well, whoever I feel like, it's absolutely splendid. Let's go.
