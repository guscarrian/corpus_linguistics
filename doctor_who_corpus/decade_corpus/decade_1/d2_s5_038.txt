The Abominable Snowmen
Episode One
TRAVERS: John?
TRAVERS: John, where are you?
DOCTOR: I don't believe it. Marvellous. After all this time.
JAMIE: Oh, what's so marvellous about that?
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see, Jamie? It's the Himalayas. And I do believe we're in exactly the right. Now, wait a minute.
JAMIE: The Hima - what?
DOCTOR: Shush. Shush.
VICTORIA: The Himalayas, Jamie. They're mountains.
JAMIE: Aye, I can see that. Hey, is it the Earth, Doctor? I don't fancy another tangle down the Cybermen's tomb.
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, shush. Yes, of course it's the Earth. Yes, yes, I think I'm right. Yes.
JAMIE: Where are these mountains?
VICTORIA: Don't you know where the Himalayas are? They're in India. Well, at least I think so.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it! I knew it, I knew it. It's incredible. Right. Oh no. No, not India. This is Tibet. That's where we are, Tibet. Now, there's no time to be lost. Come along, Jamie, we must find the ghanta.
JAMIE: The what?
DOCTOR: The ghanta, the ghanta. I put it here somewhere. Come along, Jamie, help me.
JAMIE: Hey, what am I supposed to be looking for?
DOCTOR: I told you it's. Good Lord, I haven't seen that for years.
JAMIE: Oh, that's the ghanta then?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no. It's a. Well, whatever it is, it's nice to see it again.
VICTORIA: Oh.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Come along, Victoria.
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, would you look at these? You never told me you had these.
DOCTOR: No, Jamie.
JAMIE: Hey. Oh, I could fix those easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, I was afraid of that.
VICTORIA: Jamie, you're getting as bad as the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come along, help me find the ghanta.
VICTORIA: It would help us considerably if we knew what we were looking for.
DOCTOR: Ghanta!
VICTORIA: But what is it?
DOCTOR: Oh, what is it? You don't know? Oh, it's a bell.
VICTORIA: Oh, it's a bell, Jamie.
JAMIE: Oh, a bell. Oh, well now we know what we're looking for.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a Tibetan bell, actually. A holy relic. This one is quite small. It has a dragon on it. As a matter of fact, it has rather an interesting history. It was. Oh. Ah ha, yes, I'll have that.
The Doctor takes out a huge fur coat.)
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just the thing for this climate. Now, you might as well find yourselves something while you're about it. How do I look?
VICTORIA: Doctor, you look beautiful.
DOCTOR: Yes, I thought I might. I think I'll go and have a scout around. Now, you two find the bell. It's very important.
VICTORIA: Oh, but why do you want it?
DOCTOR: Because down there it's going to guarantee us the welcome of a lifetime.
VICTORIA: Down there?
JAMIE: Oh, don't ask me. When you've been with the Doctor as long as I have, you begin to realise you don't know what he's talking about. We'd better find this bell of his.
VICTORIA: Oh, wait a minute, Jamie.
JAMIE: Hey, come and give us a hand.
VICTORIA: I want to see where the Doctor's gone. Now if I turn this to the left it should. Ah ha that's it.
JAMIE: Hey, now would you look at this. Oh, that's marvellous. What. Hey, what's that?
VICTORIA: Where?
JAMIE: A great sort of hairy beastie. Turn the thing back.
VICTORIA: Oh.
JAMIE: No, to the right.
VICTORIA: I am.
JAMIE: Downwards. That's it, there.
JAMIE: Oh no, my mistake. The great hairy beastie, it's the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. Ah, yes.
VICTORIA: A monastery.
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where he's gone.
VICTORIA: I wonder why he wouldn't take us?
JAMIE: You can never tell with the Doctor. Hey, just thought. Do they let lasses into monasteries?
VICTORIA: I don't know. Oh, don't say that.
JAMIE: Oh, never mind. I suppose he'll manage somehow.
VICTORIA: Hey, shall we open it?
JAMIE: I don't think so. The Doctor might not like it.
VICTORIA: Apart from climbing boots, I really think you ought to wear something warm.
JAMIE: I tell you, I'm a Highlander. The cold doesn't affect me.
VICTORIA: There's a great deal of difference between the Highlands and the Himalayas, Jamie.
JAMIE: Aye, they're bigger.
VICTORIA: Oh, there you are, Doctor. I found this bell thing you were looking for.
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid.
VICTORIA: Is the monastery far? Can we come too?
DOCTOR: Yes. No. One thing at a time, Victoria. We must find this ghanta.
VICTORIA: Oh, here.
DOCTOR: Hmm? Ah. Hmm.
VICTORIA: Is this where we're going, Detsen?
DOCTOR: Detsen, yes, that's the name of the monastery, but I'm afraid you're not going. Well, not yet a while anyway.
VICTORIA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, I think it'd be better if I went alone.
JAMIE: You've seen something haven't you? Would it not be better I went with you?
VICTORIA: Is there something dangerous then, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, good heavens, no. No, there's nothing for you to worry about. Now, you stay here with Jamie, inside, and I'll be as quick as I can.
VICTORIA: Oh, er, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh. I nearly forgot it.
VICTORIA: Oh, I'm getting bored. Let's go outside.
JAMIE: No, I don't think we should.
VICTORIA: All right, I'll go by myself.
JAMIE: Oh no, you won't. You won't leave me here by myself.
VICTORIA: Oh come on. We needn't be long.
JAMIE: Aye, well, just a quick look then.
DOCTOR: Anybody here?
JAMIE: What can you see?
VICTORIA: Come on, it's a marvellous view.
JAMIE: Aye, so it is. Now, come away back.
VICTORIA: Why?
JAMIE: Because the Doctor said that, Well if you must know, I am cold.
VICTORIA: Didn't I tell you? Now why don't you go and get that coat?
JAMIE: Because I'm not leaving you out here on your own, and that's final.
VICTORIA: Jamie, look.
JAMIE: What is it?
VICTORIA: Footprints. Look at the size of them. Something's been walking round the Tardis. What could it be, Jamie, a bear?
JAMIE: Whatever it is, it's pretty big. We'd better get inside.
VICTORIA: I'd like to find out what it is first. Wouldn't you?
JAMIE: Look, we must be careful. This could be dangerous. Wait while I get that sword.
DOCTOR: Hello there?
DOCTOR: Hello? Where is everybody?
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are. I thought, I thought for one moment.
KHRISONG:  What do you want here?
DOCTOR: I've come to
TRAVERS: Look! He's got my rucksack.
DOCTOR: Oh, that. Oh.
TRAVERS: You murderous devil.
KHRISONG: Who is this man?
TRAVERS: I don't know, but this is mine all right.
THOMNI:  But you said it was
KHRISONG: Be silent. You said it was a beast that attacked you.
TRAVERS: Yes, but it was dark, remember. All I could see was a vague shape, but I felt its hair. Well it's quite obvious now it's this coat he's wearing.
KHRISONG: Why did you attack this man?
DOCTOR: Me? I haven't attacked anyone. I found the haversack on the mountain.
TRAVERS: He's lying.
DOCTOR: I also found a dead man.
TRAVERS: Yes, and you killed him.
KHRISONG: Enough. Seize him.
DOCTOR: But you can't possibly
KHRISONG: Silence. This man accuses you of one crime, but there have been many others. If you are responsible, be sure you will be punished. Take him away.
DOCTOR: But this is ridiculous. Why don't you listen to me? Where are you taking me?
TRAVERS: Watch him carefully, Khrisong. He's dangerous.
KHRISONG: This is possible.
THOMNI: We do not know he is the attacker.
TRAVERS: Of course he is. I've just said he's so.
THOMNI: Why then did he come here?
KHRISONG: That also we shall discover.
DOCTOR: The welcome of a life time?
VICTORIA: Jamie, look.
JAMIE: Aye, that'll be where the beastie lives, right enough. And it's as far as we're going.
VICTORIA: Oh, we can't turn back now.
JAMIE: We can and we will. It could be dangerous.
VICTORIA: How do you know? It may be quite harmless.
JAMIE: With feet that size?
VICTORIA: Well just a quick look inside.
JAMIE: Look, if that animal is dangerous we could be walking into a trap.
VICTORIA: Oh, but Jamie.
JAMIE: No, we're going back. I mean it.
VICTORIA: Jamie. Look.
JAMIE: Hey. Wait a minute.
VICTORIA: Well, what is it?
JAMIE: Look there, just inside the cave.
VICTORIA: Where? I can't see anything.
JAMIE: It looks like a beam of wood.
VICTORIA: Oh it can't be.
JAMIE: It might not be an animal's den after all. I'm going to take a closer look.
VICTORIA: Oh but Jamie.
JAMIE: Look, a wild animal's one thing. I'm not afraid of a man. This is a man's work all right.
VICTORIA: Oh let's go back, Jamie. Jamie. Jamie!
JAMIE: Hey, come and a look at this.
VICTORIA: Jamie, listen. There's something coming.
JAMIE: Get back.
TRAVERS: It's a hundred foot drop outside that window. There's no way out, you know.
DOCTOR: I didn't think there would be.
TRAVERS: How did you track me down?
DOCTOR: Track you down? I don't even know who you are.
TRAVERS: Don't play the innocent with me. It won't work. If it wasn't for my expedition you wouldn't be here. You're one of those wretched newspaper men.
DOCTOR: Paper men? I wish I know what you are talking about?
TRAVERS: Oh, yes. You laughed at me in the press didn't you. Travers, the mad anthropologist. After that, even my own Society wouldn't finance me. But I know they're here. Twenty years I've been searching.
DOCTOR: Twenty years.
TRAVERS: I've staked my reputation and every penny I own on this expedition. Now, when I'm close to finding them, you want to steal my glory just for the sake of a cheap headline.
DOCTOR: Finding them? Finding what?
TRAVERS: Don't pretend. They're here, somewhere on these mountains.
DOCTOR: What are?.
TRAVERS: You know. The Yeti. The Abominable Snowmen.
JAMIE: Oh, it's not use, I can't shift it. Perhaps there's another way out of here. I'm going to see what's down there.
VICTORIA: Oh, no, don't. There may be more of them.
JAMIE: Aye, there might. That's why I want you to stay here.
VICTORIA: Oh no.
JAMIE: Look, you're safe enough for the moment. If you need me just yell your head off.
VICTORIA: Don't worry, I will!
DOCTOR: But it could have been the Yeti that attacked you.
TRAVERS: Rubbish. The Yeti are timid creatures. They're shy.
DOCTOR: But
TRAVERS: They're afraid of men.
DOCTOR: Why me? Why say I did it?
TRAVERS: You want a clear field, don't you. I discovered the Yeti. The honour's mine, but you want to take it from me. Why, you even murdered my companion just to get a cheap story for your newspaper.
DOCTOR: That is ridiculous.
TRAVERS: Is it?
DOCTOR: Whoever killed your friend had enormous strength.
TRAVERS: Yes?
DOCTOR: Well, could I have done it? Well, could I?
TRAVERS: I'm not going to discuss it any further. There's work to be done. The expedition must go on. Khrisong will find out the truth.
DOCTOR: Travers. Travers, come back!
KHRISONG: We have the word of the Englishman, Travers.
THOMNI: But how do we know he is telling the truth?
KHRISONG: Why should he lie? In any case, I am not so concerned with the death of Travers's companion. Four of our brothers have been slaughtered. That is my concern.
RINCHEN:  Had we not agreed that the Yeti were responsible?
KHRISONG: True, Rinchen. But have we not also wondered why? They were so rarely seen. Timid. Then, suddenly, they become savage. Did we not wonder why? Did we not wonder what or whom had brought this change. And now, here is this stranger and Travers accuses him. He may be the cause. I ask you again, let me put it to the truth. Now.
RINCHEN: You are asking us to condemn a man to certain death.
KHRISONG: I am Chief Warrior. Is it not my duty to protect you?
RINCHEN: But not by taking a man's life.
KHRISONG: Yes, if it is necessary.
SAPAN:  No. Only the Abbot can decide. Songsten alone can approve such measures.
RINCHEN: It is time for prayer, my brothers.
KHRISONG: Wait! We must decide now.
SAPAN: No, Khrisong. After our meditations we will consult the Abbot.
KHRISONG: This is foolishness. Time will be wasted. Do they wish more of our brothers to die before I'm allowed to take action.
THOMNI: There is no other way.
KHRISONG: There is, for me. Let them meditate. Let them consult. I, Khrisong, will act. Bring me the prisoner.
VICTORIA : Jamie, Jamie! It's coming back.
JAMIE: Get back in there.
VICTORIA: Oh, is it safe?
JAMIE: Aye. Now go on.
VICTORIA: Jamie, get back! It'll kill you!
Episode Two
JAMIE: Keep back, Victoria. I can't stop it.
VICTORIA: Jamie, the roof. What are you doing?
JAMIE: We've got to stop that thing somehow.
VICTORIA: You'll bury us alive!
JAMIE: It's our only chance. Now get back.
JAMIE: Are you all right?
VICTORIA: That horrible thing. What was it?
JAMIE: I don't know. Did you see what it did to my sword, though? Broke it like a piece of wood. No human's as strong as that.
VICTORIA: What is this place? And what are those?
JAMIE: Some sort of metal. They're all glowing.
VICTORIA: Oh, let's get away from here, Jamie.
JAMIE: Aye, if we can. I don't think that tunnel's completely blocked. Come on.
JAMIE: Oh, don't worry about that, it's quite dead.
JAMIE: What's the matter?
VICTORIA: Look.
JAMIE: Come on!
THOMNI: Come.
DOCTOR: Ah, and about time too. Come to release me, have you?
THOMNI: No, sir.
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, well, first things first. What's your name?
THOMNI: Thomni. You must come with me.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see, Thomni. After we've had a little chat.
THOMNI: Khrisong will be waiting.
DOCTOR: No, no. Just wait. No one seems to want to listen to me and everyone is jumping to the wrong conclusions. Now, you seem to be a reasonable sort of chap. What's going on here?
THOMNI: We are besieged. The Yeti have turned upon us. At least, that is what we thought until
DOCTOR: Until I turned up. I see. Every time I visit Detsen the monastery seems to be in some sort of trouble or another.
THOMNI: You have been here before?
DOCTOR: That attack in 1630, what was the outcome?
THOMNI: You know something of our history.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little.
THOMNI: Ah, that was also a dark period. It was then our holy Ghana was taken from us.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. Never mind, I'm sure it'll turn up again.
THOMNI: Legend tells us so, but after so
DOCTOR: This chap Travers. This chap Travers, what of him?
THOMNI: Sir, there is no time to talk, Khrisong will be angry.
DOCTOR: Ah yes, he may be angry, but he's not the Abbot, is he?
THOMNI: No.
DOCTOR: No. I don't think you'll find the Abbot will be angry when he sees what I've bought with me.
THOMNI: What do you mean? Show me.
DOCTOR: I want you to help me to get this to the Abbot.
KHRISONG: Why this delay? Seize him. Take him to the gate.
DOCTOR: Abbot. The straw.
KHRISONG: Follow me.
JAMIE: Victoria, the Tardis is that way.
VICTORIA: I know, but we must warn the Doctor.
JAMIE: How can we? We don't know where he is?
VICTORIA: Jamie!
JAMIE: Run!
RINCHEN: Khrisong. Khrisong.
KHRISONG: Do not interfere, Rinchen.
RINCHEN: Did we not decide we would consult the Abbot, Songsten, before taking action?
KHRISONG: We? You mean you had decided. The time for talk is past.
RINCHEN: But, Khrisong, the Abbot must
KHRISONG: The Abbot. Must I always consult the Abbot before I take decisive action?
DOCTOR: Travers, don't you think this has gone far enough?
TRAVERS: Well, there's nothing I can do.
DOCTOR: What do you hope to gain?
TRAVERS: Time.
DOCTOR: Time?
TRAVERS: Look, you killed my companion, left me single handed, but don't worry, you won't get another chance of getting in my way. I shall find the Yeti, with or without help.
DOCTOR: You can't possibly leave
TRAVERS: Can't I? You'll be quite safe here and I know where you are. I'm going. Now, don't worry. The monks won't harm you. They're men of peace.
DOCTOR: Men of peace?
RINCHEN: You are asking us
RINCHEN: You are asking us to agree to murder.
KHRISONG: No. Our hands will be clean.
SAPAN: After deliberately using him as bait? You cannot be so ruthless.
KHRISONG: Sapan, I believe that this man is, for some reason, trying to turn the Yeti into savage creatures.
SAPAN: But what proof is there?
KHRISONG: You heard the word of Travers. He's an Englishman, a stranger. He's a killer. Let me tie him to the gate. If the Yeti come to rescue him, we will know the truth, and my warriors will be waiting.
SAPAN: But if he is innocent?
KHRISONG: My warriors will protect him.
RINCHEN: Khrisong, there may be wisdom in what you say. All we ask is that you wait until the
KHRISONG: No. I have done with waiting. Bring him to the gate.
THOMNI: Master Abbot.  Abbot Songsten. Forgive me, Abbot.
SONGSTEN: Thomni.
THOMNI: I'm sorry, but
SONGSTEN: You know well that only I may enter here. What is this?
SONGSTEN: Where did you get this?
THOMNI: Is it not the Ghanta that was lost?
PADMASAMBHAVA :  It is, my son.
PADMASAMBHAVA : Two hundred years or more it has been lost to us. How came you by it?
SONGSTEN: It is the Master, Padmasambhava. Do not be afraid. Answer him.
THOMNI: A stranger brought it, Master.
VOICE :  The Doctor. So. He has returned.
PADMASAMBHAVA : Bring the Ghanta to me, my son.
PADMASAMBHAVA : Both of you. Do not be afraid, Thomni.
KHRISONG: Rapalchan, watch from the window there. Kheda, you, the other window. Any attempt to rescue you will now be highly dangerous for you.
DOCTOR: Look, nobody is going to rescue me, least of all an abominable snowman. And hasn't it occurred to you, that innocent or guilty, whatever's been killing your monks might very well kill me.
KHRISONG: If you are innocent, then let us hope that we will have the time to rescue you.
JAMIE: I think we've shaken it off.
VICTORIA: Have we? Oh, good.
JAMIE: Come on. It can't be much further. Listen.
VICTORIA: Now what is it?
JAMIE: Something's coming. Come on.
TRAVERS: Here, who the devil are you? What are you doing here?
JAMIE: We're on our way to the monastery.
TRAVERS: Are you indeed? You're a strange pair to find roaming round these mountains. You aren't anything to do with that newspaper fellow, I suppose?
JAMIE: What do you mean?
TRAVERS: Well, he says he's a Doctor, but I know what he's really after.
VICTORIA: Oh, have you seen him?
TRAVERS: Oh yes, I've seen him.
JAMIE: Is he all right?
TRAVERS: Oh yes, he's quite all right. So, you're going to the monastery, are you? Good. I think you'll find those lamas have quite a welcome waiting for you.
VICTORIA: The Doctor said there would be.
TRAVERS: Did he now?
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't go that way if I was you.
TRAVERS: Wouldn't you?
VICTORIA: There's something up there.
JAMIE: Aye, a great hairy beastie.
TRAVERS: Where?
JAMIE: In a cave.
TRAVERS: A cave? Have you found their cave?
JAMIE: Aye.
TRAVERS: Will you show me where it is?
VICTORIA: Oh, no.
JAMIE: No, I couldn't go back there, not with Victoria.
TRAVERS: Now look here, young fellow, do stop playing games with me. I know that you and that Doctor fellow are after the Yeti.
VICTORIA: Yeti? What's he talking about?
TRAVERS: Are you trying to tell me you're not part of some press expedition?
JAMIE: Expedition?
VICTORIA: We're not part of anything. We're just visiting the monastery.
TRAVERS: But the cave.
JAMIE: Look, if you're that keen to tangle with that beastie I'll show you where the cave is.
TRAVERS: You will?
JAMIE: After you've shown us how to get to the monastery.
TRAVERS: All right. I've nothing to lose, I suppose. All right, come with me.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Tell me, my son. Is the Doctor alone?
THOMNI: Yes, Master.
PADMASAMBHAVA: We are grateful for the return of the holy Ghanta. The Doctor is our friend. He must be treated with respect and kindness. Thomni, you will go to Khrisong. Tell him the Abbot orders the release of the Doctor. Go now. Remember, these words were spoken by the Abbot here. You will forget that you have entered this room or that you have spoken to me.
VOICE : Therefore, Songsten, we must make certain that Doctor learns nothing of what is happening. He is a man of great knowledge and intelligence, but he may not show sympathy for the powers that guide us. He may even seek to hinder the Great Plan. 
PADMASAMBHAVA: It might be wise if he departs as soon as possible.
 
RALPACHAN: Khidom. In the rocks. Did you see something? Something is coming. Khrisong, the Yeti. The Yeti!
DOCTOR: Oh no.
KHRISONG : Be ready to kill them.
DOCTOR: Jamie! Victoria! Keep back!
VICTORIA: Oh, look!
DOCTOR: Keep back! They'll kill you!
DOCTOR: Keep away! Get away!
KHRISONG: You see? I was right.
TRAVERS: Khrisong! Khrisong, it was all a mistake.
JAMIE: Doctor.
TRAVERS: I've been talking to these youngsters. I'm sorry. This is not the man that attacked me.
KHRISONG: Seize them.
JAMIE: Hey, what's going on?
DOCTOR: I told you to keep away. He's lead you into a trap.
TRAVERS: No, Doctor, believe me.
KHRISONG: Silence. Who are these people?
TRAVERS: They're friends of his.
KHRISONG: Then they shall act as hostages also.
THOMNI: Khrisong.
KHRISONG: Where have you been?
THOMNI: With the Abbot. He has given me instructions
KHRISONG: The Abbot? I gave you no instructions to be with the Abbot..
THOMNI: But, Khrisong, we must release him. This stranger has brought back to us the holy Ghanta that was lost. We must treat him with respect and kindness. These are the words of our Abbot.
KHRISONG: Is this true?
DOCTOR: Of course.
KHRISONG: Then why did you not tell me?
DOCTOR: You'd already accused me of murder. You were hardly in the right frame of mind to listen to my story of how I came by the bell, now where you? Oh please.
DOCTOR: This wasn't the welcome I expected, you know. As for you, Travers.
VOICE : It is well to remember that nothing must disturb our preparations. There is little time left now.
SONGSTEN: How, if the Doctor will not go?
PADMASAMBHAVA: His life could be in great danger. He has been a good friend in the past. It would be ill if the life of such a one became in peril.
DOCTOR: You say you found this in the cave?
JAMIE: Aye.
VICTORIA: There were lots of them.
JAMIE: Well, what do you think it is, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I've no idea. Now, this creature, what was it like?
JAMIE: Oh, it was huge and all covered with hair, like a sort of bear.
VICTORIA: It attacked us.
DOCTOR: It does sound like your abominable snowman, Travers.
TRAVERS: Oh, but they wouldn't attack anyone.
DOCTOR: No, I always thought so.
TRAVERS: They're shy, elusive creatures. Why do you think it's taken me so long to track them down?
DOCTOR: What made this? I wonder what it's for. Oh well.
DOCTOR: I'd like to see one of these creatures.
VICTORIA: It was horrible.
JAMIE: Aye, it was buried under tons of rock, yet it still just got up and came after us.
VICTORIA: Like a nightmare.
TRAVERS: Now, fear makes us imagine all sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Including creatures that don't seem to be flesh and blood.
RALPACHAN : Khrisong. Khrisong.
DOCTOR: What is it?
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
RALPACHAN : Khrisong!
JAMIE: What's he seen?
RALPACHAN : Khrisong, come quickly.
KHRISONG: What is it?
JAMIE: He must have seen something.
RALPACHAN : Look.
TRAVERS: There they are at last.
JAMIE: Hey, yes.
TRAVERS: After all these years.
KHRISONG: Ralpachan, stand watch at the walls. Pletu, I want two men either side of this base. Thomni, come with me.
TRAVERS: Look. They're magnificent. Just as I thought they'd be.
DOCTOR: Do you really think they'll attack?
KHRISONG: I don't know. They have never been this close before.
TRAVERS: Of course they wouldn't attack anyone. They're timid. You'll see.
DOCTOR: Yes, but if they do, do you think you could capture one? I would like to examine one.
JAMIE: Examine it? Aye, we'll wrap it up for you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jamie.
KHRISONG: Thomni, come. We must see to the defences. Boy, help at the gates.
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, if you really want to capture one of these beasties, I think I have an idea which might just work.
DOCTOR: Oh. Victoria?
JAMIE: Eh?
DOCTOR: Victoria, I think this is one of those instances where discretion is the better part of valour. Jamie has an idea. Come along.
JAMIE: No, Doctor
DOCTOR: Come along.
SONGSTEN: Have no fear. Now that the holy Ghanta has been returned to us, all will be well.
RINCHEN: But what if the Yeti do attack?
SONGSTEN: Have faith, Rinchen. Khrisong and his warriors will protect us.
SAPAN: Khrisong is a rash man. He was so sure that this Doctor was a threat to us.
DOCTOR: I can assure you I am not.
JAMIE: I hope this is going to work. You ready up there? Catch.
THOMNI: There is one coming.
JAMIE: Aye, one's enough.
THOMNI: The others don't seem to be moving.
JAMIE: Keep it back. I'm not ready for it yet.
THOMNI: Keep it back.
JAMIE: That's it. Stand by, here it comes.  Now!
JAMIE: Right, haul the rope, quick. Quick with the net. Pull hard. Up with it
JAMIE: Wait, wait.
THOMNI: It, it's dead.
JAMIE: Aye. Hey, why aren't the others attacking?
THOMNI: They're going.
JAMIE: Good. Let's get this one inside.
DOCTOR: You were right about one thing, Victoria. This creature certainly doesn't seem to be flesh and blood.
TRAVERS: What?
DOCTOR: It's not your abominable snowman either, Travers. Look.
DOCTOR: It's metal.
TRAVERS: That's incredible.
THOMNI: What is it?
KHRISONG: A devil's warrior.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. It's more like a robot.
TRAVERS: A robot? My dear chap, don't let your imagination run away with you.
DOCTOR: Now, why has it stopped? Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
VICTORIA: Nothing there.
DOCTOR: No, but there has been.
Episode Three
DOCTOR: Jamie, when you captured this creature, you must have dislodged it's control unit.
JAMIE: Then it must still be lying out there.
DOCTOR: Precisely.
KHRISONG: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: To have a look outside the gates. I want that unit. Come on, Jamie.
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow it.
DOCTOR: But why not?
KHRISONG: I trust no one to leave the monastery. You say this creature is not a real Yeti.
TRAVERS: It's metal. It's been made.
KHRISONG: And sent against us. Why? Why does someone wish harm to the monks of Detsen. I will trust no stranger until these questions are answered.
JAMIE: Oh, but we're on your side. Have we not convinced you yet?
KHRISONG: I am convinced of nothing.
VICTORIA: The Doctor knows all about this sort of thing. Why not let him help you?
DOCTOR: Well if you don't trust us at least send Thomni, or one of your other warriors.
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow the gates to be opened.
DOCTOR: If you want us to help you.
KHRISONG: I do not need your help. Thomni, guard them.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. A very obstinate man.
TRAVERS: Yes, well, that's that I suppose. Nothing we can do about it now. Well I'll just go and get a bit of shut-eye. Good night all.
KHRISONG: Ralpachan.
RALPACHAN: Yes, Khrisong.
KHRISONG: Stand guard at the gate. No one is to leave the monastery. Be watchful, these Yeti are more dangerous than we thought.
TRAVERS: Khrisong.
KHRISONG: What is it? What do you want?
TRAVERS: Er, I want a word with you.
KHRISONG: Well?
TRAVERS: Alone.
KHRISONG: Yes?
TRAVERS: Look, I've been thinking. Now that we've found out that these abominable snowmen are mechanical things.
KHRISONG: Well?
TRAVERS: Don't you see? It means that I'm right. The real Yeti are there, hiding up there somewhere in those mountains.
KHRISONG: This is no concern of mine.
TRAVERS: No, but Khrisong, wait. I want to go out there after them.
KHRISONG: That would be foolishness.
TRAVERS: Look, I've always said that the real Yeti are harmless. Now I must find out for sure, otherwise the whole point of my expedition will be lost.
KHRISONG: And those devil creatures would kill you.
TRAVERS: Yes, well, that's a chance I'll have to take.
KHRISONG: No. I will not allow it.
TRAVERS: But don't you see? The real Yeti may be killed by these robots. Look, I must go.
KHRISONG: No, I forbid it.
TRAVERS: Look, I'm not one of your monks, you know? You can't give me orders.
KHRISONG: No. I have said that no one will leave. Anyone may be controlling these monsters. Even you.
TRAVERS: Oh, that's ridiculous.
KHRISONG: I have given my orders. Obey them.
THOMNI: Sir, I have no choice. I must obey Khrisong.
JAMIE: Do you not realise the man's a wee bit daffy?
DOCTOR: Oh I wouldn't say that, Jamie. He's just doing his duty as he sees it.
THOMNI: But I think he is mistaken not to trust you. There is much sense in what you say.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you, Thomni.
VICTORIA: Doctor? Come here a moment.
DOCTOR: What is it?
VICTORIA: The place you said where the control unit would go, it's round.
DOCTOR: Yes?
VICTORIA: Well I wonder if? Jamie, you remember in that cave, we found that sphere. Well, don't you think it could go.
JAMIE: Hey, yes. I believe you're right.
DOCTOR: Yes, but I've thought of that. But the thing was as light as a feather. There couldn't have been anything inside it. Unless. Where is it?
JAMIE: Why, I gave it to you. You were looking at it.
DOCTOR: I remember. I put it down somewhere.
VICTORIA: The Buddha. The Buddha in the courtyard.
DOCTOR: The Buddha. I put it down by the Buddha. Oh now, please, Thomni. Please.
JAMIE: It's not here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: But I swear I put it down here by the Buddha.
JAMIE: Aye, well, it's not here now.
VICTORIA: Somebody must have picked it up.
DOCTOR: Oh dear.
VICTORIA: Maybe that guard's taken it.
JAMIE: Aye, let's ask him.
DOCTOR: No, tact, Jamie. I'll handle this. Hello, guard. good evening. I wonder if you can help us. I left a silver sphere by the Buddha there.
RALPACHAN: Sphere?
VICTORIA: It's a shiny round thing.
THOMNI: It's most important. Have you taken it?
RALPACHAN: No, and if anyone had I should have seen them.
THOMNI: Ralpachan, who has passed through the courtyard?
RALPACHAN: Master Khrisong, but he touched nothing.
JAMIE: No one else?
RALPACHAN: The Englishman, Travers.
DOCTOR: Travers? Are you sure he didn't pick it up?
RALPACHAN: I am sure. He spoke only to Khrisong and now he is gone.
DOCTOR: Gone?
RALPACHAN: He said Khrisong had given him permission to leave.
DOCTOR: But that's impossible.
THOMNI: He has tricked you.
JAMIE: Aye, he must have taken it.
DOCTOR: Yes, but why?
VICTORIA: Could he be the one that's doing it?
DOCTOR: I wonder. Are you sure he didn't take the sphere with him?
RALPACHAN: He took nothing.
JAMIE: I'll find his room and search it.
DOCTOR: Right, Jamie.
THOMNI: We must tell Khrisong what has happened.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Travers. I can't believe he has anything to do with these robots.
VICTORIA: One thing's for certain. It couldn't have moved on its own.
SAPAN: How if the devil should breath life into it again?
RINCHEN: My ghost trap will ward off the evil spirits.
SAPAN: Hmm. But to fetter it with chains is also wise. The strangers say that this creature is not flesh and blood.
RINCHEN: How can this be? Does it not move? Strangers? Do not believe them, Sapan.
SAPAN: But see.
RINCHEN: It is but armour, such as any warrior would wear. The devil in his guile wears his armour beneath the skin to protect his evil heart.
SAPAN: Such a being is against nature. It troubles me. Let us go.
SONGSTEN: What have you been doing, my brothers?
SAPAN: We have built a spirit trap about the monster, my Abbot.
SONGSTEN: This is well thought, Sapan. You are wise.
RINCHEN: You should never have allowed this monster to have been brought into the monastery, Khrisong.
KHRISONG: What I allow is my affair, Rinchen.
SONGSTEN: Gently, my son. Gently.
KHRISONG: I'm sorry, my Abbot. I try to guard my tongue, but Rinchen finds much fault in me of late.
SONGSTEN: Harsh words are like blunted arrows. It is the truth that makes them sharp.
KHRISONG: I have tried to do my duty. Under your guidance, the protection of the monastery lies in my hands.
SONGSTEN: I know, my son. Your task is a hard one.
KHRISONG: And such is our adversary, that against such creatures that I must protect you. The purpose of my life is nothing if I fail. You know, my Abbot, that I willingly would lay down my life for you and my brothers. But can I combat this with mildness? You must let me fight their strength with my strength.
SONGSTEN: Our ways are the ways of peace, Khrisong, my son. You, must not seek to change them.
KHRISONG: I would fight to preserve them. You must let me. There is no other way.
SONGSTEN: There is. It is merely obscured to our simple minds. I shall seek guidance from the Master, Padmasambhava.
DOCTOR: Khrisong. Khrisong, I must speak with you.
KHRISONG: What is it?
DOCTOR: Have you given Travers permission to leave the monastery?
KHRISONG: Of course not.
DOCTOR: Well, he's gone.
KHRISONG: How?
DOCTOR: The guard at the gate said you'd given him permission.
KHRISONG: Did he? Very well. Come with me.
DOCTOR: It's about time you let me help you.
KHRISONG: Help? I want to make sure you don't disappear as well.
VICTORIA: It's the Abbot. Is he all right?
THOMNI: Oh, yes. He's in a trance. We must leave him now.
VICTORIA: Trance?
SONGSTEN: Yes, Master
VICTORIA: Who's he talking to?
THOMNI: The Master, Padmasambhava. He's asking for spiritual guidance.
VICTORIA: How?
SONGSTEN: I hear you, Master. I am coming.
VICTORIA: Where's he going?
THOMNI: To the Holy Sanctum. To Padmasambhava.
VICTORIA: Let's follow him.
THOMNI: No, no, no. It is forbidden. No one but the Abbot may enter. No one!
KHRISONG: And this should not have happened. I hold you responsible, Ralpachan.
DOCTOR: Oh well, what's done is done. Ah, Jamie.
JAMIE: I searched his room, but it's not there.
DOCTOR: I see. Khrisong, you must see that it is vital that I examine one of these control units. Now, the one that Jamie bought down from the mountains has disappeared. Someone is trying to stop us learning the truth.
JAMIE: You must let us outside to find the other one. Och, look.
KHRISONG: Very well. I will go.
THOMNI: No! No, Miss Victoria, we mustn't.
VICTORIA: I only want to see where he's going.
THOMNI: I told you, the Sanctum. No one is allowed to go there. Please, let us go back.
VICTORIA: You mean to say you've lived here all this time and never been in there.
THOMNI: Yes.
VICTORIA: You are funny. Aren't you the tiniest bit curious?
THOMNI: No.
VICTORIA: And you've never seen this Master?
THOMNI: Never.
VICTORIA: Don't you want to know what he looks like? Oh, sure you do. Come on.
THOMNI: No, Miss Victoria. Can't you understand it is impossible?
VICTORIA: I don't see.
THOMNI: No, you do not. It is forbidden, and I have been brought up in the path of obedience.
VICTORIA: Very well.
VICTORIA: But I'll get there somehow.
DOCTOR: Hasn't he found it yet?
JAMIE: No. Khrisong, can I give you a hand?
KHRISONG: Stay where you are.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Far better if the Yeti had not been brought into the monastery.
SONGSTEN: I am sorry, Master. I could not prevent it.
PADMASAMBHAVA: The Doctor is wise. His eyes are not closed in ignorance.
SONGSTEN: If he is not ignorant perhaps he might assist you with your plan.
PADMASAMBHAVA: But his mind is on a complex plane. It is hard to fathom. There is a chance he will oppose what we have to do.
VOICE : No. We must continue with the work alone. I must now make sure our plan is imperiled no more.
KHRISONG: I've found it.
DOCTOR: Khrisong! Behind you. Yeti.
JAMIE: Come in.
KHRISONG: No.
DOCTOR: Don't be a fool.
JAMIE: Don't be a fool, they're on top of you.
DOCTOR: Come on, Jamie. Quick, get him inside. They came to get their ball back.
PADMASAMBHAVA: It would seem that the Yeti have caused some little upset at the gates. However, their work is accomplished.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Now, Songsten, observe. These three Yeti are waiting for you.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Take this pyramid I have prepared. Take it to the caves. Then the Great Intelligence will focus upon this planet. Soon it will begin to grow and at last take on physical form. At last its wanderings in space will be at an end. My work will then be done. Go now, Songsten. Do as I have asked.
VOICE : Nothing must interfere.
RINCHEN: These creatures are indeed fearsome.
JAMIE: Aye, you were lucky you weren't killed.
KHRISONG: But why did they just turn and leave? They had us at their mercy. Why?
DOCTOR: They didn't come to fight. They came for the sphere.
JAMIE: Are you sure?
DOCTOR: Pretty sure. They didn't want me to examine it.
KHRISONG: You talk of these creatures as if they were human, with a human's brain.
DOCTOR: That sphere is like a brain. They had to get it back.
JAMIE: Yes, and that Yeti we caught in the net. Well, that could have been after the sphere we found in the cave.
DOCTOR: I'd still like to know what happened to that one.
DOCTOR: This sound that you heard.
KHRISONG: It came from the sphere, I swear it.
JAMIE: Some sort of signal, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, it could be. Anyway, its a help.
SAPAN: How can this help?
DOCTOR: Well, with the right sort of equipment, these signals can be tracked.
JAMIE: You mean you can find out where the Yeti are getting there instructions from?
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie.
RINCHEN: Where can we find such equipment?
DOCTOR: We've got to back to the Tardis.
JAMIE: Right.
KHRISONG: This equipment. You have it?
DOCTOR: Yes. But it's outside there on the mountain.
KHRISONG: Then, you must go for it.
JAMIE: You mean you'll let us go?
KHRISONG: I have no choice. I have failed. My warriors are powerless. I must trust you.
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's get me coat.
VICTORIA: Oh. Oh, they're not back yet. I think I'll go and find them. No need for you to come.
THOMNI: I think it would be better if I came with you.
VICTORIA: Afraid I may go somewhere that I shouldn't? Oh, come on then. I don't want to stay in here with that thing.
RINCHEN: Thomni, it were well that you went to Khrisong.
THOMNI: Where is he?
RINCHEN: In the courtyard.
THOMNI: I will go to him. Oh, Sapan, would you care for our guest, please?
VICTORIA: Is Jamie and the Doctor. are they all right?
SAPAN: Rest easily, my child.
RINCHEN: They are in
SAPAN: They are very well. There is no need for this child to worry. Is it not so, Rinchen?
VICTORIA: You're keeping something from me.
SAPAN: My child, I have told you nothing but truth. Your friends are busy helping our brothers.
RINCHEN: Sapan, we have duties to perform.
SAPAN: True. We must leave you. It might be wiser to join Thomni in the courtyard? Excuse us, please.
THOMNI: You are not well, Khrisong. You should be resting.
KHRISONG: There can be no rest for me while this creature is here.
THOMNI: But it is dead. What harm can it do us now?
KHRISONG: Even so, wiser to destroy it. Rinchen or the Doctor. Who is right? I do not know any longer.
RINCHEN: Khrisong, you must guard this child. Sapan sent her to you in the courtyard, yet I found her near the Sanctum.
VICTORIA: I didn't mean any harm.
RINCHEN: For her own good, it would be safer if she were closely guarded.
SONGSTEN: When I have passed through the gate, you will awake. You have seen nothing.
VICTORIA: I suppose everyone thinks I'm a nuisance. Is that it?
THOMNI: We are concerned for your safety, as you well know.
VICTORIA: You're not really going to lock me up in this beastly room, are you?
THOMNI: No, I don't think that will be necessary. But you must promise to behave and not cause trouble.
VICTORIA: What do you mean?
THOMNI: I think perhaps you are a little too inquisitive, Miss Victoria.
VICTORIA: Me? I just don't like mysteries. Your Master, for instance, Padma.
THOMNI: I have told you there are some things that you should not ask.
VICTORIA: Oh, all right, I'm sorry. All right. Look, do we have to stay here. Can't I go and find the Doctor?
THOMNI: The Doctor? But he's gone.
VICTORIA: Gone? Gone where?
THOMNI: To the mountain. I thought you knew. Did Sapan not tell you?
VICTORIA: I knew he was keeping something from me. I've a good mind to go after them.
THOMNI: That would be foolish.
VICTORIA: Don't worry, I'm not really serious.
THOMNI: Oh, please, forgive me, I'm being a very bad host. Would you care for some food?
VICTORIA: No, thank you. Er, yes. Perhaps on second thoughts I will.
DOCTOR: They're not moving.
JAMIE: They can't have seen us, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Perhaps they're switched off? I wonder.
JAMIE: Don't be a fool, Doctor. No point in taking chances. Let's get to the Tardis while we can.
DOCTOR: Yes, perhaps you're right. Come on.
THOMNI: Oh, no! Miss Victoria!
THOMNI: Ralpachan. The girl, did she go out?
KHRISONG: What did you want, Thomni?
THOMNI: I went for food, now she has disappeared.
KHRISONG: Fool.
THOMNI: I think she went after the Doctor.
KHRISONG: No one has passed Ralpachan.
THOMNI: Then she must still be in the monastery.
KHRISONG: Find her!
THOMNI: Where? Where could she?
THOMNI : Miss Victoria!
PADMASAMBHAVA : It were better that you were not found in here, my child.
VICTORIA: Who's that?
PADMASAMBHAVA : The monks will look upon your presence here as sacrilege.
VOICE : Go, quickly!
THOMNI : Miss Victoria! Miss Victoria, where are you?
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!
SAPAN: My son, what is the matter?
THOMNI: Oh, Sapan. The girl, I can't find her. I think she may have
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!
Episode Four
VICTORIA: Oh, no. Thomni! Help, Thomni!
THOMNI: Run, Miss Victoria! Run! Fetch Khrisong.
VICTORIA: The Yeti! The Yeti! Fetch help. Where's Khrisong?
SAPAN: But where is Thomni? What has happened?
VICTORIA: He's in there. He's coming. Now hurry!
SAPAN: Khrisong! The Yeti, it is alive.
KHRISONG: What?
VICTORIA: It's true, Khrisong. Quick, it's coming. Do something.
KHRISONG: Get back! Get back! Ralpachan, help him. Get him. Get up.
JAMIE: What's the matter, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh? Oh, I'm just taking a breather, that's all.
JAMIE: You've heard something?
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing.
JAMIE: Well, come on then.
DOCTOR: Listen.
JAMIE: Nothing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's what's worrying me. It's too quiet. We've not seen a sign of the Yeti since we left those three back there.
JAMIE: Well, let's just be grateful and get to the Tardis.
DOCTOR: I don't like it. There's something happening on this mountain. I can feel it.
JAMIE: Here, you're giving me the willies. Come on.
JAMIE: Look, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I thought we'd been too lucky.
JAMIE: What now?
DOCTOR: I don't know. We've got to get to the Tardis somehow.
JAMIE: Aye, well you can't frighten one of those things away.
DOCTOR: No.
JAMIE: I wonder what he's waiting for?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
JAMIE: Well, he couldn't have known we were coming.
DOCTOR: It's a robot, Jamie. It merely follows instructions.
JAMIE: Who's giving them?
DOCTOR: That we shall have to find out, won't we?
JAMIE: Get down, Doctor!
PADMASAMBHAVA: Oh, Great Intelligence, have I served you well? After so many years, can I feel the grip of your power loosen? How long before your great experiment begins and I can rest? So soon? I am not sorry. What of the others? It will be done. Songsten is making final preparations.
DOCTOR: Yes.
JAMIE: Have you thought up some clever plan, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, I believe I have.
JAMIE: What are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Bung a rock at it.
JAMIE: Oh, be serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Jamie, I am.
JAMIE: Hey, no, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There you are, you see? Just as I thought. It can't see and it can't feel. Come on.
JAMIE: Don't be daft, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well. it's quite all right, Jamie. It's like those three back there. It's either switched off or not receiving. Come along.
JAMIE: Are you sure it's quite safe?
DOCTOR: Well, quite frankly, no, Jamie. But there's only one way of finding out.
JAMIE: Don't, Doctor. You might switch it on.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so, Jamie. Yes, just as I thought. Now then.
DOCTOR: Jamie, will you hold this flap open for me, please? Thank you.
JAMIE: Hey you're taking an awful risk, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad that's over. Catch.
JAMIE: Hey, I just thought of something, Doctor. The man that made these robots is very clever, right?
DOCTOR: Yes.
JAMIE: And yet we were able to walk right up to it and put it out of action just like that.
DOCTOR: You mean, why didn't they build in some sort of protective device?
JAMIE: Aye.
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps they didn't think it was necessary. I mean, look at him. Would you walk up to a creature like that with just a screwdriver in your hand?
JAMIE: No, I would not.
DOCTOR: No, there you are. I'm really rather pleased with myself.
JAMIE: Have you not found it yet?
DOCTOR : Yes, Jamie. Sorry, I'm just coming.
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Jamie?
JAMIE: Look!
DOCTOR: Ah, splendid, splendid. It's sending out a signal. That's just what we wanted.
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor, you'll have to help me or I'll let go.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, you mustn't do that. Jamie, no!
JAMIE: It's no use, I'll have to let go.
DOCTOR: Whatever happens, you mustn't let go, Jamie.
JAMIE: It's no use, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Jamie, get a rock.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: A rock! Put it in the hole in its chest.
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm all right. Just a bit puffed, that's all. Jamie, these things are programmed to return to their Yetis. That one that disappeared in the monastery. That wasn't taken.
JAMIE: It moved itself. It could have got to the Yeti, the one we captured. Come on.
KHRISONG: You deliberately disobeyed my orders.
THOMNI: It was the only sensible thing to do.
KHRISONG: Be silent. If you had not opened the gate the creature would not have escaped.
VICTORIA: Khrisong, you know we couldn't stop it. You'd have been killed. Anyway, it was my idea to open the gates.
RINCHEN: Was it? Was it also your idea to breath life into the Yeti?
VICTORIA: What do you mean?
RINCHEN: Were you not with the creature when it came to life?
VICTORIA: Yes, but
SAPAN: You think that she was
RINCHEN: Who else could have done this?
THOMNI: Oh, this is foolishness.
KHRISONG: Continue, Rinchen.
RINCHEN: The creature was here, dead. What reason had you to enter this room?
VICTORIA: I was hiding.
RINCHEN: Hiding? Why? For what purpose?
KHRISONG: Speak!
THOMNI: She means no harm.
KHRISONG: Be silent.
RINCHEN: Your young warrior seems to anxious to protect this stranger. What are they plotting, these two?
THOMNI: No! You do not understand.
RINCHEN: Where is your authority, Khrisong, that your warriors forget their allegiance.
KHRISONG: Lock them up.
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What is it?
JAMIE: It's started again. The signal's started.
DOCTOR: Oh no. No, that's another sort of signal.
DOCTOR: Jamie, I've just picked up another signal.
JAMIE: Oh, Doctor, let's get to the monastery. You said you'd do all your tracking from there.
DOCTOR: Jamie, you don't seem to understand.
JAMIE: Oh, don't I though? While you're fiddling with that thing, this sphere is calling up all the Yeti in creation.
DOCTOR: What a perfect opportunity to trace the main transmitter.
JAMIE: Aye, and a perfect opportunity to get ourselves killed.
VICTORIA: I wish the Doctor would come back.
THOMNI: This Doctor, is he your guardian?
VICTORIA: I suppose he is in a way.
THOMNI: He is a good man.
VICTORIA: I think so.
THOMNI: Tell me, Miss Victoria, how did he come by our holy bell?
VICTORIA: I don't really know. Why?
THOMNI: It disappeared three hundred years ago.
VICTORIA: Oh, stolen, you mean?
THOMNI: No, it was given to a stranger, for safe keeping during a time of trouble. It was never returned.
VICTORIA: A stranger? Of course, the Doctor. They're one and the same man.
THOMNI: But three hundred years?
VICTORIA: Oh, dear. Well, I know this sounds silly, but the Doctor can travel through time and space. He has a machine, you see, and, well, I don't really understand it myself. It's rather difficult to explain.
THOMNI: There is no need. I understand perfectly.
VICTORIA: You do?
THOMNI: Yes. You see, it is said that our Master, Padmasambhava, can free himself from his earthly body and travel great distances.
VICTORIA: Oh.
THOMNI: But this can only be obtained after many years of strict discipline and self training.
VICTORIA: You mean, you mean that you might be able to do that sort of thing?
THOMNI: Perhaps, one day.
KHRISONG: Rinchen, where is Songsten?
RINCHEN: No one has seen him for many hours. He will be with Padmasambhava.
KHRISONG: Padmasambhava.
SAPAN: To seek guidance.
KHRISONG: Or is it to escape his responsibilities?
SAPAN: Khrisong, you should not say such things.
KHRISONG: Why not? Has anyone seen Padmasambhava? Ralpachan. Inform me when the Doctor returns.
SAPAN: Khrisong would be wise not to voice such thoughts.
RINCHEN: Perhaps, but brave men are impatient. And he is no fool.
SONGSTEN: Sleep, Ralpachan. You have not seen me. You have not opened the gate. No one has entered. When I leave the courtyard, you will not know that you have slept.
PADMASAMBHAVA: You have done well, Songsten. Already the Great Intelligence begins to take on material form. But it demands more. It must expand. That is why you and our brothers must depart from this place.
SONGSTEN: Leave the monastery, Master? I understand. And the strangers?
PADMASAMBHAVA: The strangers? Oh, yes. I will tell you how to deal with them, if they return.
JAMIE: I wish this thing would keep quiet.
DOCTOR: Not much further.
DOCTOR: Well, we were expecting it.
JAMIE: Now what do we do?
JAMIE: Trapped!
DOCTOR: Jamie, give me the sphere. Give me the box.
JAMIE: What now?
DOCTOR: Move forward very slowly. Jamie, when I say run, run. Run like the wind. Don't worry about me.
JAMIE: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Now, Jamie, please. No heroics, Jamie.
JAMIE: But surely, Doctor
DOCTOR: Now Jamie. Run. Run! I know what I'm doing. I hope.
DOCTOR: It worked.
THOMNI: It's no use, Miss Victoria. Even if Padmasambhava would consent to see us, we can't get out.
VICTORIA: Can't? We haven't even tried.
THOMNI: Thank you, Ralpachan.
RALPACHAN: I am sorry about this, Thomni.
VICTORIA: Oh, good. I am thirsty.
VICTORIA: Ugh. A funny taste. Oh, Ralpachan, has the Doctor? Oh!
THOMNI: Miss Victoria, what is it?
VICTORIA: No, no, no, don't touch it. The drink.
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!
RALPACHAN: I will fetch some water. Stay close to her, Thomni.
THOMNI: Miss Victoria?
THOMNI: Miss Victoria.
VICTORIA: I'm sorry, Thomni.
THOMNI: Miss Victoria!
SONGSTEN: And in his wisdom our Master, Padmasambhava, has given me his guidance. We must all leave the monastery. It is impossible for us to defeat the Yeti.
KHRISONG: But there may be a way. The Doctor
SONGSTEN: No, my son, they are invincible. They will destroy us all. Therefore, in order to avoid further bloodshed, it has been decided
KHRISONG: Songsten, I have just been informed that the Doctor has returned. He brings with him equipment which will help us to defeat these monsters.
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, the Master has
KHRISONG: The Master? My apologies, Abbot. I have felt the strength of these Yeti, but still I will not meekly turn away. I mean to fight.
SONGSTEN: Brothers, Khrisong thinks only of our safety, we know, but in this matter he has been led astray. He has forgotten his vow of obedience.
SONGSTEN: In due time he will realise his
RAPALCHAN: Master Abbot, the girl has escaped. She tricked us by feigning sickness.
RINCHEN: She is a devil women.
SAPAN: She must be found.
SONGSTEN: Find her, my brothers.
KHRISONG: We had no defence against it, yet it just walked through the gates. Doctor, we must act quickly or the Abbot will prevent us.
JAMIE: Yes, but is Victoria all right?
KHRISONG: I did as you asked. She is locked up. Is this your equipment?
DOCTOR: Yes.
KHRISONG: Stand aside.
DOCTOR: Travers!
TRAVERS: Thank heavens. Doctor. Up there. A pyramid.
JAMIE: What's he saying?
DOCTOR: Shh. Go on.
TRAVERS: A pyramid. It's a
RINCHEN: Seize them. Seize the strangers. Khrisong, the girl has escaped. She is a devil woman.
JAMIE: Victoria? Hey, what's happened?
RINCHEN: Take these people to the cells.
KHRISONG: No! These people can help us. Besides, this man is ill. I cannot allow it.
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, you will obey. Take them.
JAMIE: No, but
DOCTOR: Where is Victoria?
JAMIE: Doctor, what did he mean 'a devil woman'?
DOCTOR: What is this about Victoria? Where is she? Where are you taking us?
KHRISONG: I cannot allow this.
SONGSTEN: You cannot allow? These are the orders of our Master. You must obey.
KHRISONG: But these people can help us.
SONGSTEN: The Master tells us there is no help against the Yeti. He tells us to leave.
KHRISONG: We will not leave.
SONGSTEN: Khrisong, do not defy me. Find the girl. Instruct your warriors.
SONGSTEN: Go after them, Sapan.
SONGSTEN: Advise me Padmasambhava. Khrisong turns his warriors away from the path of obedience.
PADMASAMBHAVA : I hear, Songsten, and I understand. Well, if they will not be lead then they must be driven from the monastery. This is what you must do.
SONGSTEN: I understand, Master.
SONGSTEN: Help them search for the girl. Go quickly.
PADMASAMBHAVA : Come in, my child.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come in. You have no alternative.
Episode Five
PADMASAMBHAVA: Do not be afraid.
VICTORIA: Are, are you?
PADMASAMBHAVA: I am Padmasambhava.
VICTORIA: I'm sorry to intrude. I know this room's meant to be private, but
PADMASAMBHAVA: You need my help. Is that not so?
VICTORIA: Oh yes. Please, the Doctor.
PADMASAMBHAVA: One moment, child.
VICTORIA: But.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Shh.
VICTORIA: What is it?
PADMASAMBHAVA: The courtyard is empty.
VICTORIA: Courtyard?
PADMASAMBHAVA: I must do what I am compelled to do.
VICTORIA: What's that?
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come closer.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Look. See?
VICTORIA: It's one of those horrible creatures. A Yeti.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Indeed.
VICTORIA: But how
PADMASAMBHAVA: You have not seen it.
JAMIE: She must have had some reason. I mean, why would she run off like that?
THOMNI: Her motives were not clear to me, Mister Jamie.
JAMIE: Oh headstrong, that's what she is.
TRAVERS: No! No! No!
DOCTOR: All right, Travers. You're quite safe.
TRAVERS: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes.
TRAVERS: What happened? Oh, my head.
DOCTOR: Just relax. You're safe, in the monastery.
TRAVERS: The monastery?
DOCTOR: What happened? Where did you go to?
JAMIE: Was it the Yeti?
TRAVERS: No, no, not the Yeti. It was something else. It was a light, a blinding white light and a noise. A piercing noise that went right through my head. I couldn't stand it. Then I can't remember anymore.
THOMNI: You spoke of a pyramid.
TRAVERS: Pyramid?
THOMNI: Yes, at the gates when you returned.
TRAVERS: Pyramid? No, no. I left the monastery, then er, then. It's no use, my mind's a complete blank.
DOCTOR: You just rest.
DOCTOR: What is it?
TRAVERS: No!
THOMNI: We are taught that it is better to share a memory of fear.
TRAVERS: Evil. A feeling of evil. Like a shadow on my mind.
DOCTOR: Yes?
TRAVERS: I felt as though I was going to drown.
JAMIE: But where did this happen?
TRAVERS: I, I don't know, I can't remember. Oh, I'm tired, so tired.
DOCTOR: You just rest. You'll feel better. Poor fellow, he's completely exhausted.
JAMIE: What does he mean, a shadow?
DOCTOR: We'll just let him sleep.
THOMNI: What could it be, this evil of which he speaks?
JAMIE: What was that?
MONKS : The Yeti! The Yeti!
JAMIE: Khrisong, what's happening?
KHRISONG: The Yeti have broken in. You are safe here.
JAMIE: But Victoria, where is she?
RINCHEN: Who can tell? But she will be found. She must be stopped.
JAMIE: Doctor, is there nothing we can do?
DOCTOR: Shush.
SONGSTEN: Calm.
KHRISONG: Forgive me, Songsten. I have failed to defend the monastery.
SONGSTEN: Failed? No. This disaster was written. Man cannot alter his destiny.
KHRISONG: I should have obeyed you, my Abbot. My desire to fight these creatures was foolish, but I will defend you with my life.
SAPAN: Abbot, I fear for Rinchen's safety.
SONGSTEN: Is he not here?
SAPAN: No. He would not seek safety. He is so sure that the girl is responsible.
KHRISONG: He is still searching for her?
SAPAN: Yes.
SONGSTEN: Find her.
KHRISONG: If it is not too late.
RALPACHAN: The Yeti. They are turning back.
KHRISONG: Then you are safe for the moment. Ralpachan, come with me.
RINCHEN: Stop! Stop! She-devil, wherever you are, call off these monsters. Spare us.
RINCHEN: Oh, no! Oh, no!
KHRISONG: He's dead.
RALPACHAN: The monastery of Detsen is accursed.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Now it is complete. Now the monks will leave. By nightfall the monastery will be emptied. The mountain yours. Will this then be your final command? Will you then be content? I do not understand, but I will continue to serve.
PADMASAMBHAVA: And now we must consider the problem of you and your friends. The Doctor is not easily frightened like my poor monks. Therefore, my child, you will assist me. Together we will make sure that he leaves. Come closer. This is what you will do.
THOMNI: This is the courtyard and we are here, to the south.
DOCTOR: I see, Thomni. So here lies north.
THOMNI: That is so.
DOCTOR: What are those readings again, Jamie? Jamie, the readings?
JAMIE: What? What?
DOCTOR: The readings?
JAMIE: I'm sorry, I was thinking of Victoria.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but there's nothing we can do about her.
JAMIE: Two ninety seven, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Two ninety seven. Now that will give us a bearing roughly there.
THOMNI: Does your science help us, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No. We want another bearing, say, from there. And where those two cross, that will be where the transmissions are coming from. But that won't tell us why.
THOMNI: Why?
DOCTOR: Yes, what is the purpose behind all this. That's what we have to find out, ay Jamie?
TRAVERS: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Are you feeling better?
TRAVERS: Better? What are we doing in here? What's happened?
DOCTOR: You had a spot of trouble on the mountain.
TRAVERS: Trouble?
JAMIE: Aye, with the Yeti no doubt.
TRAVERS: Funny, I don't remember. Sorry, I'm a bit confused.
JAMIE: Well you sounded it, with all that talk about.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure it'll all come back to you in time.
TRAVERS: Yes, with the headache I've got, no wonder I can't remember anything. I think I'll get a bit of fresh air. Why is this door locked?
SONGSTEN: Do not blame yourself, Khrisong. Death is inevitable. Sambhutar, Ghentan, take up our brother. We will take him with us on our journey. There will be a time to mourn our brother.
KHRISONG: Put to the test I ran and hid like a mountain rabbit. I'm not fit to be called a warrior. We must lead out our brothers before more of them are destroyed.
SONGSTEN: Gather what is needed, my brothers. Soon it will be the hour for meditation, then we must depart.
KHRISONG: What of the strangers, master Abbott?
SONGSTEN: They will be taken with us to a place of safety.
SAPAN: But the girl is lost.
SONGSTEN: Khrisong and his warriors will find her.
KHRISONG: And the Master? What of Padmasambhava?
SONGSTEN: His powers are great. He will remain.
SONGSTEN: The holy Ghanta.
KHRISONG: Child, how came you
SAPAN: Shh. She has entered the Sanctum.
KHRISONG: Then let me.
SONGSTEN: Silence. See, she is about to speak.
PADMASAMBHAVA : This is a time of much danger.
SONGSTEN: Padmasambhava.
PADMASAMBHAVA : I have chosen to speak to you myself through the lips of this maiden. She bears the holy Ghanta. Bear it away to safe keeping. Treat this child with kindness. She and the strangers are innocent of any malice towards you. Their wish is but to help you against the Yeti. But in my wisdom I tell you, there is no help. Detsen must be abandoned. When the wind destroys the nest, so the bird will build another.
SONGSTEN: But what of you, Master.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Go, with my blessing.
SONGSTEN: But, Master.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Do not question. I will remain here to the end.
SAPAN: Will a day come for our return to Detsen?
SONGSTEN: Take her to rest. Ralpachan, release the strangers. Bid them make ready. It is time for prayer. The last time at Detsen. Come, my brothers.
RALPACHAN: You are released.
TRAVERS: I should jolly well think so. What the devil do you think you're up to.
RALPACHAN: You must prepare to leave with us.
TRAVERS: I shall have a few words to say to the Abbot before I go anywhere.
JAMIE: Never mind about that. Have you found Victoria yet?
RALPACHAN: She is safe. Khrisong is with her.
JAMIE: Ah, good.
KHRISONG: Are you recovered? Child?
JAMIE: There you are, I've been worried sick. Where have you been? Victoria? What have you done to her? Doctor? Doctor, I think she's ill.
DOCTOR: Let me see.
VICTORIA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria.
VICTORIA: There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me away!
DOCTOR: Yes, yes of course.
JAMIE: Victoria, what's happened? Tell us? What's the matter with her? Victoria, it's me, Jamie.
DOCTOR: How long has she been like this?
VICTORIA: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria.
VICTORIA: There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me away!
KHRISONG: The child is still in a state of trance.
DOCTOR: Still? What do you mean?
KHRISONG: She spoke to us with the voice of the Master.
THOMNI: Ah. Then she did reach the holy sanctum.
JAMIE: What are you talking about?
THOMNI: She was certain that Padmasambhava would recognise the Doctor.
JAMIE: Recognise the Doctor?
THOMNI: Yes, he has been here before.
DOCTOR: But that was three hundred years ago. It's the same man.
RALPACHAN: Khrisong, the Abbot Songsten wishes us to join our brothers in prayer.
KHRISONG: Very well. You will prepare to leave. Is Mister Travers ready?
RALPACHAN: He is in the courtyard.
KHRISONG: Come, Thomni, to prayer.
THOMNI: Khrisong, will you forgive me?
KHRISONG: We have both of us strayed from the path of obedience.
DOCTOR:  Jamie, there is something I have to do.
JAMIE: Right. Hey, why are we whispering?
DOCTOR: It's my voice. She reacts to my voice.
JAMIE: Oh, it's that hypnotism thing. Can you not do anything about it?
DOCTOR: Yes I can, but I need more information. Now, you wait here.
JAMIE: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: I'm going to see a very old friend.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Oh, Intelligence. You promised to release me, yet still I feel your grasp upon this frail body. Why? What is happening? This was not your plan. But if you continue to expand? I have brought the world to its end.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Come in, Doctor. Good to look upon your face again. So many years.
DOCTOR: Padmasambhava. So it's true.
PADMASAMBHAVA: I have been kept alive so many years, but now our time left is very, very short. Listen carefully. Perhaps you can
DOCTOR: Kept alive? I don't understand.
PADMASAMBHAVA: I didn't know. I didn't realise.
DOCTOR: What? Try to tell me.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Intelligence. Formless in space. I astral travelled.
DOCTOR: I see. You made mental contact with this intelligence?
PADMASAMBHAVA: It used my mind. It controls my body.
DOCTOR: But why?
PADMASAMBHAVA: Experiment. Wished material form. A voice, it said. I believed. Experiment. But now. Help. You must help me.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I will help you. But first you must tell me things. Why are the monks being driven away? What is the purpose of these robots, the Yeti? Where is their control? Padmasambhava? Padmasambhava?
JAMIE: I wish there was something I could do.
DOCTOR: What on earth was that?
JAMIE: Oh, it was just an idea.
VICTORIA: Doctor. There is great danger. You must take me away. Take me away. Take me away!
JAMIE: Doctor, you've got to do something. Did you find out what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Not about Victoria, no. But I found some very interesting clues as to what's been happening.
JAMIE: Oh, never mind about that. It's Victoria you ought to be worrying about.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, you're quite right. Victoria must come first. Trouble is I really need more information. However, I'll just have to take a chance. It may just be simple post-hypnotic suggestion. On the other hand.
JAMIE: Yes.
DOCTOR: It may be something worse.
JAMIE: What if it is?
DOCTOR: Well, let's just hope it isn't.
DOCTOR: Victoria.
VICTORIA: Doctor. There is great danger. You must take me away.
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria.
VICTORIA: Take me away.
DOCTOR: Listen to me. You've been taken away. You're no longer in the monastery. You're safe in the Tardis. Now do you understand? You're safe. In the Tardis. Yes. Well, look at me. Look at my eyes. You're feeling tired, very sleepy. Drift away. Let yourself drift away into sleep. Deeper. Deeper. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Oh, not you Jamie.
JAMIE: Hey, what?
DOCTOR: So far, so good.
JAMIE: Hey, I never knew you could do that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: No. Neither did the person who hypnotised Victoria.
JAMIE: What now?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm tempted to ask her what happened, but I don't think I dare probe too deeply. The important thing is to get rid of this implanted fear. It's growing every minute.
JAMIE: What if you can't?
DOCTOR: Well, we shall just have to do as she asks and take her away. If we don't.
JAMIE: Yes.
DOCTOR: She'll go out of her mind.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: Well, that's the object of the exercise. To get us away from the monastery. But I'm not beaten that easily.
JAMIE: Hey, you're taking an awful risk.
DOCTOR: I know what I'm doing, Jamie. Victoria? Now, Victoria, you can hear my voice, can't you?
VICTORIA: Yes.
DOCTOR: Oh, good. Now I'm going to take you a little way back in the past, Victoria. You're in the cell with Thomni. Do you understand?
VICTORIA: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good. Now you're going to forget everything after that. You went to sleep. Is that clear? Good. Jamie and I have come back to the monastery and you are in the meeting room with us. You're feeling happy, but a little tired. Do you understand?
VICTORIA: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, when I count three, you're going to wake up. One, two, three.
VICTORIA:  Oh, oh dear. Oh, I must have dropped off.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe you did. I've got work to do.
VICTORIA: What are you grinning at?
DOCTOR: Travers? Travers.
TRAVERS: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling?
TRAVERS: Oh, much better thanks. Look, I've been taking a look up the mountain. Those robots are still there. They're just standing, not moving. I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Yes. I think things are coming to a head.
TRAVERS: What are they up to? What are they waiting for?
DOCTOR: Instructions. Travers, can you remember any more of what happened to you on the mountain?
TRAVERS: I'm afraid not. My mind's a complete blank.
DOCTOR: Are you prepared to risk it again?
TRAVERS: I thought we're supposed to clear out.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the monks are, but I want to get back up the mountain. One more bearing and I shall know where the control centre is.
TRAVERS: I see. You want me to help you.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you will.
TRAVERS: What about your young friends?
DOCTOR: Oh, they're leaving with the monks, but I want to get out of here before anyone sees us. Will you help?
TRAVERS: All right, I'm on.
DOCTOR: Oh, good.
DOCTOR: What's the matter?
TRAVERS: I don't know. I've got a feeling I've done this before. Now, what do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: I want you to stay here and take some readings. Those Yeti are not transmitting. I'm going over there to stir things up a bit.
TRAVERS: I don't understand that thing. You'd better let me go.
DOCTOR: Oh no, it's far too dangerous. I can't ask you to take that sort of risk.
TRAVERS: Rot. I can take care of myself. Right. Now, wish me luck.
DOCTOR: No, wait!
DOCTOR: That's odd.
TRAVERS: You got your readings Because if you've got the reading.
DOCTOR: Yes.
TRAVERS: What's up?
KHRISONG: Is there any sign?
RALPACHAN: No. Every room is empty.
THOMNI: Mister Travers and the Doctor are nowhere to be found.
KHRISONG: It as you wished. The monastery is deserted.
SONGSTEN: This is well. I will ask a final blessing of our Master, Padmasambhava, then we will depart.
VICTORIA: Padmasambhava!
JAMIE: Try not to think about it.
VICTORIA: But I think
JAMIE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Khrisong, I have found the control.
KHRISONG: It is too late, Doctor, I can no longer help you.
DOCTOR: But you don't understand. It's here, in the monastery.
TRAVERS: What? That's impossible.
THOMNI: But the monastery is empty. We are all here.
DOCTOR: Are we? Are we all here?
THOMNI: The Master!
SAPAN: Songsten is with him.
KHRISONG: Then he is in great danger. Stay where you are, all of you.
TRAVERS: Songsten. I remember. Songsten, the Yeti, on the mountain. Yes, yes, it's all coming back to me.
JAMIE: Well, tell us.
TRAVERS: There was this cave.
Episode Six
DOCTOR: It was Songsten who took this pyramid into the cave?
TRAVERS: That's right.
JAMIE: And the Yeti never harmed him?
TRAVERS: No.
DOCTOR: Songsten. He's the link I've been looking for.
THOMNI: But Khrisong is with Songsten now.
DOCTOR: Then he's in danger.
KHRISONG: Songsten! Danger. You are in great danger. Come away from this place.
SONGSTEN: What madness is this?
VOICE : Khrisong, whence came you by such foolish thoughts?
KHRISONG: Don't try and frighten me. Who are you? I demand to know what is happening.
SONGSTEN: Demand? You are in the presence of the Master.
KHRISONG: Yes, a master who controls the Yeti. What is hidden in there?
SONGSTEN: Forgive him, Master.
PADMASAMBHAVA : Of course. But our brother must not be allowed to depart in the knowledge that I am other than what I am.
VOICE : Songsten!
KHRISONG: Why do you put him in a trance?
VOICE : You understand, Songsten?
SONGSTEN: I understand, Master.
PADMASAMBHAVA : You may enter, Khrisong.
SONGSTEN: One moment. You may not take weapons into the presence of the Master.
VOICE : Are you afraid?
VOICE: You have done well, Songsten. You will now.
PADMASAMBHAVA: Why are you making me do this? Why? Release me, I beg of you. I am.
VOICE: Songsten, you will now go forth with the monks. You will never return.
SONGSTEN: Yes, Master.
JAMIE : Khrisong, where are you?
THOMNI: Khrisong! What has happened?
JAMIE: Khrisong.
TRAVERS: We're too late.
SONGSTEN: What have you done to Khrisong?
TRAVERS: What have we done? Well, that's a bit cool, I must say.
THOMNI: You have killed him.
SONGSTEN: I?
VOICE : Songsten, kill them!
DOCTOR: Jamie, grab hold of him. His hands.
DOCTOR: Quick, get him out of here.
KHRISONG: Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's all right. Lie still. I'll get help.
KHRISONG: Too late. My time has come. Closer. My brothers, they are not to blame Songsten. He was in a trance.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now just try and
KHRISONG: No. Leave. Leave me here.
THOMNI: My brothers. My brothers, Khrisong is dead.
SAPAN: Dead?
RALPACHAN: By whose hand?
THOMNI: By the hand of our Abbot, Songsten.
SAPAN: This cannot be.
TRAVERS: Aye, it's true enough.
SAPAN: No. What reason would he have to do such a vile thing?
JAMIE: Obviously he thought Khrisong knew too much.
SAPAN: Songsten, is this true?
JAMIE: Keep back!
RALPACHAN: Do not interfere, stranger.
THOMNI: No, leave him alone. There's been enough killing.
VICTORIA: Jamie, no!
THOMNI: Wait! Wait, my brothers. This is no time for rashness.
DOCTOR: He is quite right. He is quite right. You listen to him.
RALPACHAN: Well?
SONGSTEN: Kill them. Kill them. Kill them.
THOMNI: Look, is this our Abbot who loves peace? Surely you can see he was made to kill Khrisong. He is a helpless puppet.
TRAVERS: But I saw him on the mountain. He was leading the Yeti.
DOCTOR: Yes, but by command, unknowingly. Thomni is right. Songsten is merely a puppet.
SAPAN: Who has done this to him?
RALPACHAN: Is it you?
THOMNI: No. I tell you I saw Songsten change. He was put in a trance by the Master.
SAPAN: Have a care what you say.
DOCTOR: Now listen to me, all of you. Your Abbot is not responsible. But neither is Padmasambhava. He too is controlled. Now do as you'd planned. Leave the monastery. There is great evil here.
TRAVERS: No, Doctor, you're wrong. The evil is on the mountains. It's that hideous thing in the cave.
SAPAN: Wherever it may be, what can we do to overcome such a force? My brothers, let us obey the Doctor.
THOMNI: What of you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I will stay here, Thomni.
JAMIE: Oh, me too.
VICTORIA: Why?
DOCTOR: I have to. This things that's here, this evil, it will spread. It has to be stopped and I think I can do it. Thomni, will you help me? It will be dangerous.
THOMNI: You can rid us of this evil?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can. And if we succeed, the monks will be able to return.
THOMNI: Then of course I will help.
VICTORIA: Doctor, you're not going to send me away with the monks, are you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Victoria. I think it best.
VICTORIA: Well, I won't go.
DOCTOR: No, I didn't think you would.
JAMIE: Hey, Doctor. Songsten, he's unconscious.
RALPACHAN: Sapan, tend our Abbot.
DOCTOR: No. Wait. There are things I have to find out and only Songsten can tell me.
JAMIE: What makes you so sure he's going to do that?
DOCTOR: Sit him down here, Jamie. Over there.
TRAVERS: The Doctor's got it wrong. I've seen that thing in the cave. That's what we've got to destroy.
RALPACHAN: The Doctor thinks the evil is here, in
TRAVERS: I know, I've seen it. He hasn't. He said himself that Padmasambhava was being controlled. And it's that thing that was doing it. I'm going to get at it. Are you coming with me?
RALPACHAN: Very well.
TRAVERS: Good man, come on.
RALPACHAN: What do you plan to do?
TRAVERS: I don't quite know yet. Got to get to that cave. The pyramid's the answer. I just have to take a shot at it with this. Come on.
DOCTOR: And the Yeti?
SONGSTEN: They were designed to serve the Intelligence.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, this Intelligence, it is confined to the cave?
SONGSTEN: No.
DOCTOR: No?
SONGSTEN: It has broken its promise. Now it demands the whole mountain.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Songsten, I want you to help me.
SONGSTEN: I want to help you.
DOCTOR: Now these Yeti, they are controlled?
SONGSTEN: Yes, by Padmasambhava.
DOCTOR: Yes, but the control units, they were made somehow, somewhere?
SONGSTEN: The Master laboured for nearly two hundred years. With the help of the Intelligence, he built the creatures and the other wonderful machines.
DOCTOR: These small Yeti models. Their movements must be mirrored by the real robots?
SONGSTEN: True.
DOCTOR: But there must be a control. A machine that gives out the orders. Now, where is that control?
SONGSTEN: The sanctum.
DOCTOR: But I have seen the sanctum.
SONGSTEN: Throne. Behind the throne there lies a hidden room.
DOCTOR: How do I get into it? Songsten, how do I get into it?
TRAVERS: That was a close one. Heading towards the monastery.
RALPACHAN: Should we not return?
TRAVERS: No, now we've come this far. Let's push on. Come on.
DOCTOR: Take care of him, Sapan.
SAPAN: I will. He has suffered much.
SONGSTEN: Is it time to leave?
DOCTOR: Now, as soon as the monks have left, we must get into that control room.
JAMIE: How do we get past Padma-thing-me?
DOCTOR: I'll deal with him. But remember, as soon as we're in the sanctum, whatever happens, Thomni and you must smash the controls.
VICTORIA: What do you mean, whatever happens?
DOCTOR: Padmasambhava will use super-normal powers if necessary. For a start, he'll try to hypnotise you again.
VICTORIA: Well how can I stop him?
DOCTOR: Thomni, you'd better teach her the Jewel of the Lotus prayer. It'll give her something to concentrate on.
THOMNI: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Jamie, where is Travers?
JAMIE: Travers?
DOCTOR: Well, he's not here.
JAMIE: Perhaps he's deserted us.
DOCTOR: No, I don't somehow think he's done that, but I'd like to know what he's up to.
TRAVERS: Well, we're going the right way. There's some sort of path along here.
RALPACHAN: Look.
RALPACHAN: What is it?
TRAVERS: It's that hideous light from the cave. It's spreading all over the mountain.
RALPACHAN: It's blinding me. How can we reach the pyramid?
TRAVERS: We can't. It's too late for that now, I'm afraid.
RALPACHAN: But it will engulf the monastery.
SAPAN: Doctor, why will you not accept the aid of our warrior brothers?
DOCTOR: Because they're needed to guard you and the lamas, Sapan.
THOMNI: Besides brave hearts will not suffice for this battle.
SAPAN: Protect them, Thomni. We shall pray for you.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Don't worry, everything will be all right. When it's all over you can come back. I hope.
DOCTOR: Now don't forget. I will go into the sanctum first and deal with Padmasambhava. And, as soon as it's safe, make for the curtain behind the throne. That's where the control room is.
THOMNI: But when we have destroyed the machine, what'll happen?
DOCTOR: I haven't the faintest idea.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. It's going to be all right.
JAMIE: Hey, we might all be blown to smithereens.
VICTORIA: What am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: Well nothing, I hope, but one of us just might need help. Are we ready? Come on.
RALPACHAN: What shall we do?
TRAVERS: Looks as though we're well and truly cooked.
RALPACHAN: Look. There below us, torches. The monks must have left.
TRAVERS: Yes, but has the Doctor?
RALPACHAN: How can we tell? We are trapped.
TRAVERS: I don't know.
RALPACHAN: We cannot enter the monastery.
TRAVERS: Looks as though we'll just have to sit tight.
RALPACHAN: Can we not try and join my brothers?
TRAVERS: No. The Doctor may still be in there. I'm sure he is.
VOICE : Why are you here? Why did you not heed my warning? You are stubborn, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Who are you?
VOICE : You know well it is I, the Master, Padmasambhava, who speaks.
DOCTOR: Oh no, it isn't. I know Padmasambhava. He's my friend. Where have you come from? Why are you using his body in this fashion?
VOICE : Such a brain as yours is too small to grasp my purpose.
DOCTOR: Too small?
VOICE : I am much power.
DOCTOR: Much power?
DOCTOR: Just a simple levitation. A childish trick. Now stop playing games and open these doors. Or are you afraid to meet me face to face?
VOICE : You are rash.
DOCTOR: Now, anything can happen now. Just trust me, and above all, don't panic.
VICTORIA: No! No! The Doctor said to wait.
DOCTOR: Now!
JAMIE : Come on, Thomni.
DOCTOR: Quickly. Into the control room. Smash the controls.
JAMIE: To work, Thomni.
VICTORIA: Doctor, he's bringing the Yeti in!
DOCTOR: Victoria, Victoria, I can't hold him. The models. Knock over the models! No, Victoria, don't let him. Jewel of the Lotus. Om mane padme hum. Om mane padme hum.
VICTORIA: Om mane padme hum. Om mane padme hum.
TRAVERS: At last. Come on.
VICTORIA: Om mane padme hum. Oh, it's no good. I can't move.
DOCTOR: You've got to.
VICTORIA: I can't!
DOCTOR: Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! Yeti's coming!
JAMIE: Yeti?
THOMNI: But we have destroyed the machines.
JAMIE: Well there must something else that controls them. The control unit. Of course, the sphere.
VOICE : One stroke of fortune will not save you.
VOICE : Stupid man. Did you not feel enough of my power when you met me in the cave?
TRAVERS: The cave?
DOCTOR: The cave. Jamie! There was a pyramid in the cave!
JAMIE: There's one here too.
DOCTOR: Destroy it!
VOICE : No!
VICTORIA: Look at him.
PADMASAMBHAVA: At last, peace. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye old friend.
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. It worked. The Intelligence is destroyed.
TRAVERS: Yes, well, it was most decidedly tricky for a minute or two.
DOCTOR: Yes. Thomni, you can signal the monks they can return.
TRAVERS: Doctor, are you trying to tell me that that old man was responsible for all this? The Yeti? The cave?
DOCTOR: Oh no, no. He was just a tool in the hands of a monstrous brain. It wasn't his fault.
VICTORIA: It's horrible. Let's get away from here.
JAMIE: Aye, come on.
THOMNI: Please, Doctor. Our Abbot will be most grieved that he did not thank you personally. Will you not wait?
DOCTOR: Ah no, Thomni, we're anxious to get back to the Tar.
DOCTOR: We're anxious to get back.
THOMNI: Goodbye, Doctor.
TRAVERS: I'll see them safely up the mountain.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Thomni.
JAMIE: Goodbye.
VICTORIA: Bye, Thomni.
JAMIE: Aye, well those things won't bother us anymore, Doctor.
VICTORIA: Those horrible things.
DOCTOR: Ah, they were clever machines. Almost a pity to have had them destroyed. Well, at least you'll have something to take home from your expedition, Mister Travers.
TRAVERS: I suppose so. But nobody'll believe me. They'd think I'd had it made. No, I'm afraid the expedition's over now.
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, look.
JAMIE: Oh no.
DOCTOR: It can't be.
TRAVERS: A Yeti. A real Yeti! At last! Excuse the haste. Goodbye and all that. Mustn't lose this one.
JAMIE: Do you think he'll ever find his abominable snowman, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, that we shall never know, Jamie. What's the matter with you? Are you cold or something?
JAMIE: Oh it's all right for you in your home made Yeti kit.
DOCTOR: Yes, I suppose there is a little bit of a nip in the air.
JAMIE: A nip? A nip? Just look at my knees. They're bright blue.
DOCTOR: What a horrible sight.
JAMIE: Could you not land us somewhere warmer next time?
DOCTOR: Jamie, you never know, do you?
