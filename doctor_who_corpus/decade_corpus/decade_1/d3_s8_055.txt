Terror of the Autons
Episode One
ROSSINI:  Who the heck are you? Well?
MASTER: I am usually referred to as the Master.
ROSSINI: Oh? Is that so?
MASTER: Universally.
ROSSINI: Well, I am Luigi Rossini, internationally, and conjurers I don't need. Okay?
MASTER: Unfortunately I need you, Lew Russell.
ROSSINI:  What did you call me?
MASTER: Lew Russell. It happens to be your real name.
ROSSINI: Now listen, Mister. Get off my pitch while you're still safe!.
MASTER: Why, you insolent primitive.
ROSSINI: Oh, so you it want the hard way, do you? Right.
MUSEUM ATTENDANT: Here, you! What do you think you're doing?
DOCTOR :  I don't want to set the world on fire!
DOCTOR: Not today, thank you.
JO: Doctor, I, er
DOCTOR: I said not today, thank you.
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
DOCTOR: Oh no!
JO: It's all right. I've dealt with it.
DOCTOR: Dealt with it? You've ruined it!
JO: But your bench was on fire.
DOCTOR: Three months delicate work and now look at it, you ham-fisted bungler.
JO: But this whole place might have gone up in flames.
DOCTOR: My dear young lady, steady state micro-welding always creates more smoke than fire.
JO: Steady state micro-welding?
DOCTOR: Yes. An advanced engineering technique pioneered by the Lammerdenes. A remarkably gifted race. They have nine opposable digits.
JO: Nine what?
DOCTOR: Nine opposable digits. Yes, well, never mind. Look, I said I don't want any tea today, thank you.
JO: I'm not the tea lady.
DOCTOR: Then what the blazes are you doing in here?
JO: I've
DOCTOR: Don't you know this area is strictly out of bounds to everybody except the tea lady and the Brigadier's personal staff?
JO: I'm your new assistant.
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
JO: The Brigadier sent me along to introduce myself, Doctor. Josephine Grant.
DOCTOR: How do you do, Miss Grant? I really don't think you're suitable.
JO: I'm a fully qualified agent, you know. Cryptology, safe breaking, explosives.
DOCTOR: Fire fighting? Yes, well, I'm sorry, my dear, but what I need is a scientist.
JO: I took general science at A-Level.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm sure you did, but, even so.
JO: I'm sorry I ruined your experiment.
DOCTOR: That's all right.
DOCTOR: Look, Miss Grant, I've got a great deal of work to do. You must excuse me.
JO: The Brigadier wanted me to show you this report.
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: Something was stolen for the Natural Space Museum. It was on loan from this HQ.
DOCTOR: Oh, what was?
JO: A translucent polyhedron, eight and a half inches in diameter.
DOCTOR: Well, that's the Nestene's energy unit. It should never have left this building.
JO: Apparently they wanted it for a special display. The Brigadier signed the authorisation.
DOCTOR: The Brigadier's an idiot! I knew I should have destroyed that thing but somehow it would have felt like murder.
JO: You mean it was alive?
DOCTOR: Yes, in a way. Yes, that container held a form of alien intelligence.
JO: But you've just got to be joking.
DOCTOR: There's precious little to joke about, Miss Grant. That thing is appallingly dangerous.
JO: But who would want to steal it?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Who and why?
GOODGE: I told her again last night.
PHILIPS: Hmm?
GOODGE: Elsie. Cut out the hard-boiled eggs, I said. Quite apart from their effects on my digestion, they're aesthetically boring.
PHILIPS: Uh huh.
GOODGE: Here you are.
PHILIPS: Oh, thank you, Goodge.
GOODGE: Will there be anything else?
PHILIPS: Er, not for the moment. Oh, by the way, talking of eggs, I want a four hour scan below the hydrogen line tomorrow.
GOODGE: All right.
PHILIPS: I'll give you the precise wavelength later.
PHILIPS: Goodge! What the blazes is happening?
PHILIPS : Goodge, do you hear me?
PHILIPS: The shaft angling code has gone crazy. Are you there, man? Check the feed back control!
PHILIPS : Goodge! What the devil do you think you're playing at?
BRIGADIER: You've been agitating for a new assistant ever since Miss Shaw went back to Cambridge.
DOCTOR: Liz was a highly qualified scientist. I want someone with the same qualifications.
BRIGADIER: Nonsense. What you need, Doctor, as Miss Shaw herself so often remarked, is someone to pass you your test tubes and to tell you how brilliant you are. Miss Grant will fulfil that function admirably.
DOCTOR: Well, what's the girl doing here anyway? UNIT's no place for trainees.
BRIGADIER: No, I couldn't agree more, Doctor, but Miss Grant was very keen to join us and she happens to have relatives in high places.
DOCTOR: So you tried to palm her off onto me. Well, it won't work, Brigadier. I'll have a properly qualified assistant or none at all.
BRIGADIER: Very well, Doctor. I'll reassign her.
DOCTOR: Good.
BRIGADIER: But I think you should break the news to her yourself.
DOCTOR: Well, now, wait a minute.
JO: Hi, Doc. I. Good morning, sir.
BRIGADIER: Good morning, Miss Grant.
JO: I've checked all incoming reports. Still nothing on the stolen meteorite.
BRIGADIER: Thank you.
JO: And I've chased those electronic spares you wanted. They promised delivery tomorrow, without fail.
DOCTOR: Miss Grant, I, er, I, er. Well, I don't. This is, er, a bit difficult for me to say but. Er. Thank you, Jo. I can see you're going to be of great help to me.
JO: Thank you, Doctor. Report from one our field sections, sir. Captain Yates. Some kind of sabotage at a radio telescope. Two of their scientists have disappeared.
DOCTOR: Let me see that.  We'd better get down there right away.
YATES: The Director's expecting you, sir.
DOCTOR: Is that where the sabotage took place?
YATES: No, sir. It seems to have happened in the control cabin in the top of that tower.
DOCTOR: Well, that's where you'll find me then. No, Miss Grant. You stay here with the Brigadier.
YATES: Director? Miss Josephine Grant and Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT.
JO: Good morning.
TIME LORD: Oh, dear. Don't go away, Doctor. My co-ordinates seem to have slipped a little. Still, not bad after twenty nine thousand light years.
TIME LORD: I do hope you can spare a moment or two, Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Sarcasm always was a weak point with you, wasn't it. May I say that I think you look quite ridiculous in those clothes.
TIME LORD: I am travelling incognito.
DOCTOR: Oh? Why?
TIME LORD: We Time Lords don't care to be conspicuous. Some of us, that is.
DOCTOR: Look, if you've come down merely to be rude
TIME LORD: I came to warn you. An old acquaintance has arrived on this planet.
DOCTOR: Oh? One of our people?
TIME LORD: The Master.
DOCTOR: That jackanapes! All he ever does is cause trouble.
TIME LORD: He'll certainly try to kill you, Doctor. The tribunal thought that you ought to be made aware of your danger.
DOCTOR: How very kind of them.
TIME LORD: You are incorrigibly meddlesome, Doctor, but we've always felt that your hearts are in the right places. But be careful. The Master has learnt a great deal since you last met him.
DOCTOR: I refuse to be worried by a renegade like the Master. He's a, he's an unimaginative plodder.
TIME LORD: His degree in cosmic science was of a higher class than yours.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, er, yes, well, I, I was a late developer.
TIME LORD: Would you call that little surprise unimaginative?
DOCTOR: What?
TIME LORD: Look through the door, but be careful.
DOCTOR: A volatiser. If that thing should fall
TIME LORD: It'll explode and probably destroy this research centre completely. You see, he's rigged it up so that it opening the door will make it fall. Such an amusing idea.
DOCTOR: Well, you'd better think of a witty way of dealing with it.
DOCTOR: Now wait!
TIME LORD: Oh, good luck!
YATES: Any luck?
DOCTOR: Keep back.
YATES: What's that?
DOCTOR: A bomb.
YATES: A bomb! Is it defused?
DOCTOR: It is now.
YATES: Where on earth did you find it? Oh, I'm so sorry. Er, this is the Director.
DIRECTOR: How do you do? I hope you realise the police have already investigated this matter.
DOCTOR: Where's Lethbridge Stewart?
YATES: He and Miss Grant are questioning the staff.
DOCTOR: Huh. A fat lot of use that'll do.
DIRECTOR: After all, it's hardly an international matter, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand you've lost a couple of scientists.
DIRECTOR: Yes. Professor Philips and his assistant, Goodge.
DIRECTOR: Goodge must have left in quite a hurry.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, he must.
DOCTOR: Oh, no!
YATES: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: Look for yourself.
DIRECTOR: It's Goodge!
MASTER: I'm very glad that you could see me at such short notice, Mister Farrel.
FARREL: Well, your telephone call was pretty intriguing, Colonel. Er, do sit down.
MASTER: Oh, thank you.
FARREL: Er, we, er, do have a little spare capacity at the moment.
MASTER: I would say more than a little, considering that your plant has been working at less than half volume for over a year.
FARREL: I see you've done your homework, Colonel. Well, I, er, admit I was interested when you mentioned a steady repeat demand.
MASTER: The people I represent, Mister Farrel, can never have too much plastic.
JO: What is a Nestene?
DOCTOR: Ask Captain Yates. He had the job of clearing up the mess last time.
JO: Well, what is a Nestene?
YATES: Oh, a Nestene? Er, it's a bit difficult to describe, exactly.
DOCTOR: A Nestene is a ruthlessly aggressive intelligent alien life form.
JO: Well, what do they look like?
DOCTOR: Well I expect myself their basic form is analogous to a cephalopod.
JO: What's a cephalopod?
DOCTOR: An octopus. I thought you took an A-Level in science.
JO: I didn't say I passed. Urgh, an octopus.
DOCTOR: They manifest themselves as a disembodied, mutually telepathic intelligence.
JO: But if they're disembodied, how can they hurt us?
YATES: They make themselves bodies when they need them.
JO: You mean like Frankenstein?
DOCTOR: No. They have a natural affinity for plastic. Now, if you've quite finished asking questions?
JO: Sorry. Just forget I'm here.
YATES: At least we should be ready for them this time.
DOCTOR: Too late, Captain. They're here already.
JO: What?
DOCTOR: The radio telescope is their bridgehead. They used that to contain energy into that surviving Nestene unit.
DOCTOR: Brigadier. Look, that unit must be discovered within the next hour.
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, Doctor. If we had some idea where its been taken.
DOCTOR: Well, try the plastics factories, man.
BRIGADIER: Yes. I'll set up a search straight away. Yates.
YATES: Right, sir.
JO: Can I help, sir? Please?
BRIGADIER: Very well, Miss Grant.
JO: I'll start by making out some lists.
MASTER: You will obey me and no one else. Do you understand?
FARREL: I shall obey. I shall obey. I shall obey.
BRIGADIER: And you're convinced this man is working with the Nestenes?
DOCTOR: Oh, I should think by now he'll be calling himself their Commander in Chief. Vanity's his weakness. Ah, there you are. It should be cooked by now.
BRIGADIER: This, er, this device of his. Is it very powerful?
DOCTOR: Oh, I should say roughly equal to a fifteen megaton bomb.
BRIGADIER: Really? Well, the research boys'll be glad to get their hands on this.
DOCTOR: Too late, Brigadier. I've boiled out the contents. The weapons that you have on Earth are quite nasty enough as it is.
MASTER: Now the computer.
FARREL: This way.
MASTER: I see. Excellent.
FARREL: What are you going to do?
MASTER: I wish to alter the masterplan.
FARREL: But that would change our whole production lines!
MASTER: Naturally.
FARREL: My father would never dream of allowing
MASTER: My dear Mister Farrel, don't worry about him. You are under a new thumb now.
JO: Oh, hello.
MASTER: Who went to the Radio Telescope Station?
JO: Myself, the Brigadier and The Doctor.
MASTER: As I thought. Curiosity is his weakness. Well, I should have to see that it's satisfied. You will return to UNIT with a negative report. You found nothing suspicious. Everything was in order.
JO: Yes. Everything in order.
MASTER: When you leave this room you will have no memory of meeting me, only Mister Farrel.
JO: Only Mister Farrel.
MASTER: Your instructions are already implanted. You will obey them without a further word from me.
JO: I shall obey.
MASTER: Good.
YATES: Yes, what is it, Sergeant?
BENTON: Excuse me, sir. We've just had a call from the civil police. They found Philip's car abandoned.
YATES: Where?
BENTON: In a field about nine miles away from the research station, and they say there's a zinc box in the boot with UNIT markings.
YATES: The energy unit?
BENTON: I've told them not to touch it, Doctor.
YATES: What do you think, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I still am.
YATES: Huh?
DOCTOR: Thinking.
McDERMOTT:  I think you'd better go home. Sure, look, I know all our customers and there isn't a Colonel Masters amongst them.
FARREL: You're quite wrong, James. He's taking over our entire production at the moment.
McDERMOTT: Entire? Here, look, I'll tell you what, Rex. Now look, you go through those orders, yes? And you show me this chap. Go on.
FARREL: All right.
FARREL: I don't understand. There should be a card for him!
McDERMOTT: Look Rex, I think you ought to take a couple of days off. I'll ring your father and he can come
FARREL: May I remind you, Mister McDermott, that my father is retired. I'm running this place now.
McDERMOTT: Your father built this place up from nothing. Sure, I remember when I was a wee lad, he
FARREL: All right, all right, all right! Let's not go over all that again.
McDERMOTT: Look, I'm sorry, Rex, but I especially promised your father I would
FARREL: There's no need to bring father into it! Look, I'll go and fetch him. He's only down in the lab.
McDERMOTT: Who?
FARREL: Colonel Masters, of course. He'll explain everything.
McDERMOTT: Sylvia? Get me Mister Farrel senior, please.
MASTER: No! Don't be frightened, Farrel. The Autons are my servants. Why do you come here?
YATES: That's not an issue padlock, is it?
BENTON: No. I'll try and find some keys.
JO: I can open it.
YATES: A key for every occasion, eh?
YATES: Doctor, we've got the box down here.
DOCTOR : Good. I'll be right down.
DOCTOR: Stop her! That's a bomb!
JO: I've got to open it! I've got to!
Episode Two
BENTON: Strewth! There's going be some complaints about that you know, Doctor.
DOCTOR: My dear Sergeant, if that box hadn't been tied, you wouldn't be here to receive any complaints.
BENTON: Yes sir. I mean, no, sir.
YATES: What gave you the idea it was a booby trap, Doctor?
DOCTOR: She did.
YATES: What's wrong with her?
DOCTOR: Almost certainly post-hypnotic alienation.
YATES: She's been hypnotised?
DOCTOR: Well, of course. Why else do you think she tried to blow us all to pieces? Come on, my dear, come and sit down over here. Get a chair, Captain Yates. Come on, you sit down here. There. Good.
YATES: Well, I understood that under hypnosis it was impossible for
DOCTOR: You thought that under hypnosis it was impossible for a subject to be persuaded to do anything that was against his nature?
YATES: That's right.
DOCTOR: Well, it's a fallacy, Captain. The Master can completely control the human mind.
BENTON: So he can just take over anyone he likes?
DOCTOR: No, not quite. No, some minds are stubborn enough to resist hypnosis. In any case, it doesn't last. Away from the Master's influence, the mind struggles constantly to free itself.
YATES: Is she in some sort of a trance?
DOCTOR: I think the current jargon is schizoid dissociation. It's because she was forced to do something against her will and her conscious mind refuses to accept the fact. The result is a deep trauma.
YATES: Jo? Where's the Master?
DOCTOR: She won't remember that.
YATES: But she might. Jo! Where is the Master?
McDERMOTT: Mister Farrel tells me you've changed the mix. What right have you got to interfere? Do you know you've ruined a whole day's production?
MASTER: You call this ruined?
McDERMOTT: Well, it's the wrong colour and the wrong texture. Of course it's ruined!
MASTER: You don't appreciate its full potential, do you.
McDERMOTT: Look and I don't want to. It doesn't meet our specification.
MASTER: This plastic has got unique properties, Mister McDermott. Allow me to demonstrate.
McDERMOTT: It's unique, right enough. So, er, you're a magician as well as a Colonel, eh?
MASTER: I am many things.
McDERMOTT: Aye, well, that's as maybe, but you're not a director of this company, Colonel Masters. I am in charge of production here and I answer only to Mister Farrel and his father.
MASTER: Look, why don't you try it?
McDERMOTT: Well, you'll never sell that, I'll tell you that for nothing. Sure, it looks like like a black pudding.
MASTER: Try sitting in it.
McDERMOTT: It's got a cold clammy feel to it. Now plastic should be warm and dry with a
MASTER: Sit down!
McDERMOTT: It's moving.
MASTER: No, I will not tolerate his insolence.
FARREL: Sylvia, will you check Mister McDermott's entitlement on termination of employment, please?
MASTER: It's a very clumsy operation, this. You can see now why this product's got to be changed.
FARREL: Oh, I don't know. Seems very effective to me.
MASTER: What? Yards of plastic to accomplish that which can be done by just a few inches?
FARREL: A few inches?
MASTER: Yes, Farrel. The human body has a basic weakness. One that I which I shall exploit to assist in the destruction of humanity.
DOCTOR: Jo, wake up. Wake up, Jo. This is the Doctor. You're amongst friends.
YATES: It's no good. I think we're just wasting
DOCTOR: Please! Be quiet!
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
JO: Doctor? Doctor! You
DOCTOR: All right, all right.
JO: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Calm down, Jo. Calm down. We're quite safe.
JO: There was an explosion!
DOCTOR: That was a long way away. Believe me, that was a long way away. Now we're all quite safe. Look around you. See for yourself. Look around. Look. Look, we're all here.
JO: The box! I had to open it! There was a voice.
DOCTOR: Yes well, that voice. Where were you when you heard that voice?
JO: A room
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm.
JO: I don't know where.
DOCTOR: Yes. What sort of a room?
JO: There was a desk.
DOCTOR: Yes.
JO: A telephone.
DOCTOR: An office? Was it a factory office?
JO: Yes! Yes, an office.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, where was that factory? Do you know the name of the factory?
JO: No.
DOCTOR: Well, try and remember.
JO: I can't remember. I can't remember!
Farrel Senior, Farrel's father, is given the bad news.)
FARREL SR: Dead? He can't be.
FARREL: I'm afraid so, father.
MASTER: Yes he sat down in this chair here, and just slipped away.
FARREL SR: I can't take it in.
FARREL: Yes, it's very sad.
FARREL SR: Well, what did the doctor say?
FARREL: I. I'm not sure. It all happened so suddenly. You see
FARREL SR: Oh, well, anyway, I suppose it's hardly decent in the circumstances but I've driven a long way to talk to you, Rex.
FARREL: Er, yes, father? What about?
FARREL SR: About the way you seem determined to throw away the years of work I've put into this factory. Now just what is going on here?
FARREL: We're changing our policy, father. Introducing new methods, new products.
FARREL SR: You're doing nothing of the sort. You'll carry on on the lines I laid down, or I'll come out of retirement and do the job myself. I'm not past it, you know.
MASTER: Allow me to explain, Mister Farrel.
FARREL SR: I'd be very much obliged if you would.
MASTER: The changes that I have suggested are for the good of the factory. Now you must trust me, there's nothing to worry about.
MASTER: Nothing to worry about.
FARREL SR: Trust you. Nothing to worry about. There's a great deal to worry about, sir! And frankly, the thing that worries me most is your presence here.
MASTER: Why you
FARREL: No!
MASTER: Congratulations, Mister Farrel. Usually I can overcome opposition but your will is exceptionally strong. One might say dangerously strong.
FARREL SR: Damned impertinence. Rex. Rex, hadn't you better go home? I'll see after things here.
FARREL: No. Please, I can manage.
FARREL SR: All right. I'll give you till tomorrow. And by then I want this Masters fellow out of here and production back to normal.
MASTER: Oh, Mister Farrel?
FARREL SR: I've nothing to say to you, sir.
MASTER: Well, I thought if you actually saw one of our new lines.
FARREL SR: Disgusting object. No demand for a thing like that.
MASTER: I think you're wrong, Mister Farrel.
FARREL SR: Well, since you won't be making any more of them, we shan't have a chance to find out.
MASTER: Why don't you keep this for a while? Think it over.
FARREL SR: I don't want the thing!
MASTER: Ah, but I insist!
FARREL SR: You're wasting your time.
MASTER: Not at all. I'm simply trying out a new product.
DOCTOR: Hello, Jo. Are you feeling better?
JO: Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
DOCTOR: That's good.
JO: I just wanted to say how sorry I am.
DOCTOR: What on earth for?
JO: The bomb! I might have killed you all.
DOCTOR: Oh, that was nothing to do with you, my dear. That was the Master.
BRIGADIER: You're supposed to be on sick leave, Miss Grant.
JO: I'm okay now again, sir.
BRIGADIER: Oh, so you've recovered your memory then?
JO: No, I'm afraid I haven't. I've tried and tried to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, well don't. It'll only make things worse. Leave your mind alone. Something may pop up of its own accord.
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, we can't just sit about waiting for something to pop up from Miss Grant's mind. If my agents don't turn up something soon, I'm going to surround and search every factory on that list.
DOCTOR: You know, Brigadier, your methods have all the refined subtlety of a bull in a china shop.
BRIGADIER: Any news?
YATES: Well, it's a bit tenuous. sir.
BRIGADIER: Well, out with it. 
YATES: You know the field where we found Professor Philips' car?
BRIGADIER: Yes.
YATES: Well, Sergeant Benton noticed that the turf was all churned up. So he did a bit of checking and he found that a circus had just left.
DOCTOR: Oh? Where's the circus now?
YATES: Tarminster.
BRIGADIER: I'll get some of my men down there with photographs of Philips. Someone at the circus may have seen him.
DOCTOR: I haven't been to a circus for years. I think I'll go myself.
BRIGADIER: All right, Doctor. I'll get you an escort.
DOCTOR: No, thank you, Brigadier. No, I'll go on my own, if you don't mind. Don't want a lot of soldiers crashing about, do we?
JO: Can I come?
DOCTOR: Er, no, Miss Grant, I don't think so. Not just yet.
JO: But I'm fine now.
BRIGADIER: Miss Grant.
DOCTOR: I'll need some photographs of that man Philips.
BRIGADIER: Oh, they're in my office, but I still don't see why you don't want members of my company to come with you. 
YATES: What's up now?
JO: Oh, nothing. Life's just wonderful.
YATES: Easy, love.
JO: I've really got off to a terrific start, haven't I? I find the man everybody's looking for, I forget where he is and I end up by trying to blow you all sky high!
YATES: No-one's blaming you.
JO: Oh no! You all just tell me to keep out of the way. I'm not a child, you know.
YATES: Well, you're acting like one.
JO: Sorry. But if only I could show them.
YATES: Don't try. Just do as the Brigadier says.
JO: Yes, of course, you're quite right.
FARREL: I've sent the staff home as you ordered, Colonel.
MASTER: Excellent. Begin maximum output of our new product.
FARREL: Without workers?
MASTER: The Nestene Autons will run the factory.
FARREL: Oh! Er, I'm still afraid my father will make trouble. He, er, doesn't understand.
MASTER: Don't worry about your father. I've persuaded him to change his mind.
FARREL: Why did you send Philips to the circus? The UNIT people may find him.
MASTER: But I sent him there to be found by UNIT. Or better still, by the Doctor.
FARREL: I'm sorry, I don't understand.
MASTER: You see, the bomb was by way of being a greetings card, a small little gallantry on the eve of battle. The car will lure the Doctor to the circus, and there, I shall destroy him.
DOCTOR: Philips. Professor Philips.
HANDLER: Sorry, pal, never seen him.
MRS FARREL: Oh, poor Mister McDermott. It must have been a terrible shock for Rex.
FARREL SR: On the contrary. When I walked in, he was just carrying on with his work as if nothing had happened.
MRS FARREL: Oh John, no!
FARREL SR: And this Colonel Masters was just as unconcerned. Frankly, they both seemed to me quite inhuman.
MRS FARREL: You will make Rex get rid of that man.
FARREL SR: I most certainly shall. Frankly, I didn't take to the chap really, or to his repulsive toy. Now, just look at that!
MRS FARREL: Oh, it's a horrible looking thing. There's something evil about it.
ROSSINI: Into me wagon, quick!
DOCTOR: This is outrageous. Let me go at once!
ROSSINI: You've got some hopes. All right, Tony, he's no elephant. What's your name?
DOCTOR: Smith.
ROSSINI: Smith? You've got no imagination. Try again, Mister Smith.
DOCTOR: Doctor actually.
ROSSINI: Horse doctor maybe?
DOCTOR: You're an insulting ruffian, aren't you?
ROSSINI: Why were you so interested in my friend's horsebox?
DOCTOR: What's your friend's name?
ROSSINI: His name's none of your business.
DOCTOR: A strange name. How long's the horse box been here?
ROSSINI: Shut up! I'm asking the questions! Tony.
ROSSINI: He'll snap your arm like a twig, Mister. Tony don't talk much but he's strong.
DOCTOR: All right, my dear chap, there's no need to do that. I'm perfectly prepared to answer all your questions. And, er, what was the question?
ROSSINI: My friend's horsebox. Why were you so interested?
DOCTOR: I was listening.
ROSSINI: What for?
DOCTOR: Certain vibrations.
ROSSINI: Hmm. I don't think my friend's going to like you.
DOCTOR: I'm sure of it. Where is he?
ROSSINI: Away.
DOCTOR: How much are they paying you?
ROSSINI: Come, come, Doctor. Gentlemen don't discuss money.
DOCTOR: Nonsense, gentlemen never talk about anything else. Now, listen to me. If you're prepared to forget that you've ever seen me and let me go, I will reward you very handsomely.
ROSSINI: Is that so? Let's have a look, Tony.
ROSSINI: Oh, pity.
DOCTOR: I can get money quite easily.
ROSSINI: Eccentric millionaire, eh? Hello.
DOCTOR: Do you recognise that man?
ROSSINI: Maybe.
DOCTOR: That is a photo of a missing government scientist. If you've had anything to do with concealing him, you are in very serious trouble.
ROSSINI: Someone's in trouble all right, Doctor, but it isn't me.
JO: They're holding him prisoner in one of the caravans. 
BRIGADIER: Just what do you think you're doing down there, Miss Grant?
JO: Sorry, sir, no time to argue. I'll go and see if I can help the Doctor.
BRIGADIER: You'll do nothing of the sort. You'll stay in the background till I arrive. Is that clear?
JO: It's Professor Philips.
FARREL SR: It must have been a heart attack I suppose.
MRS FARREL: Try not to worry about it, dear. What's this thing doing over here?
FARREL SR: It's the boy's attitude I can't understand.
MRS FARREL: It certainly doesn't sound like my Rex. Oh well, I'll go make the coffee.
FARREL SR: It's beyond me.
MRS FARREL : John, are you all right?
MRS FARREL: John? 
ROSSINI: You don't give very good answers, my friend.
DOCTOR: Maybe you're not asking the right questions.
ROSSINI: No Tony, don't break his arms. Yet. I think I'll tell my friend you've arrived. He'll know what to do with you.
ROSSINI: You know, Doctor, the cost of meat is exorbitant. Maybe my friend'll let me feed you to the tigers.
DOCTOR: You've got a very distorted sense of humour, haven't you?
ROSSINI: All right, Tony, watch him.
DOCTOR: The strong silent man, eh?
DOCTOR: You've got no right to keep me here, you know? I've got a good mind to call for help. Help! Help! Help!
JO: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What the blazes are you doing here? I told you to stay at headquarters.
JO: It's just as well for you I didn't, isn't it?
JO: Doctor, I've seen Professor Philips.
DOCTOR: Oh, where?
JO: He went into a horsebox, over there.
MASTER: This girl you say who's been following you. describe her?
PHILIPS : Small, blond, short hair.
MASTER: Sounds like the Doctor's little friend. I wonder. Switch on the scanners, Philips.
MASTER: Very well, Philips. You know what you have to do.
PHILIPS : Yes, Master.
JO: What on earth is he doing inside a horsebox?
DOCTOR: It isn't exactly a horsebox. It just happens to look like one.
JO: You mean there isn't a horse inside.
DOCTOR: No more than there's a policeman inside my police box.
JO: So what do we do now?
DOCTOR: Well
DOCTOR: Wait! Philips, wait! Don't move, Jo.
JO: What's he holding?
DOCTOR: Some sort of a grenade. Now, Philips, you listen to me. You are about to commit murder.
PHILIPS: I must. He said I must!
DOCTOR: Wait. You just listen. The Master is controlling your mind. You must resist him. You can resist him. You are Professor George Philips of the Radio Telescope research centre. You must resist him!
DOCTOR: You must resist him! Down, Jo!
JO: What happened?
DOCTOR: He tried to get rid of it. Poor chap.
JO: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Shan't be a moment.
ROSSINI: Come on! Spread out! They can't have gone far!
JO: Hurry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, that didn't take long, did it?
JO: Long enough, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Now, wait a minute, listen to me. Now listen to me, all of you!
ROSSINI: Tried to rob my caravan and killed one of my men with a bomb! Get 'em!
BRIGADIER: Here, wait!
YATES: They're in the back, sir. The Doctor and Jo.
BRIGADIER: Better go and bail them out.
JO: Are you all right, Doctor? Doctor!
DOCTOR: Thank heavens. Nothing damaged.
JO: You speak for yourself. I'm bruised all over.
DOCTOR: It's a good thing you chaps turned up when you did, otherwise we might have been lynched. Lethbridge Stewart must have sent them. Yes, it's nice to know he can use his head once in a while.
BENTON: Yes, sir. I've checked with County Headquarters. You were right.
BRIGADIER : Then it's not a police car at all.
BENTON: No, sir. Definitely not.
JO: Doctor? Where are they taking us?
DOCTOR: It isn't Tarminster.
JO: It's some sort of a quarry.
DOCTOR: Excuse me officer, could I see your warrant card?
Episode Three
BRIGADIER: Spread out. they can't be far!
BRIGADIER: Doctor? Miss Grant?
DOCTOR: Get down, man! Get down!
YATES: Look out!
DOCTOR: They're Autons! Bullets can't stop them!
DOCTOR: Right, now!
FARREL: Colonel? Colonel, the Autons that were sent to recover the bodies of the Doctor and the girl
MASTER: Have returned without them. I know.
FARREL: And you're not angry?
MASTER: Because the Doctor's escaped again? No. He's an interesting adversary. I admire him in many ways.
FARREL: But you still intend to destroy him?
MASTER: Of course and the more he struggles to postpone the moment, the greater the ultimate satisfaction.
BRIGADIER: Six, the Nestenes have landed a small bridgehead force. Seven, they're operating from somewhere from within this area. Eight, they're being led by an intelligent alien known as the Master. Nine, all their operations have, so far, been primarily directed at us here at UNIT.
BRIGADIER: Ten, what are you doing, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Did you want me?
BRIGADIER: I should like your attention, Doctor, until we've settled on a course of action. That is, of course, unless you have something of greater importance to attend to?
DOCTOR: No, no, of course not. No, do carry on, it's most interesting.
BRIGADIER: Thank you. Where was I?
YATES: Ten, sir.
BRIGADIER: Ten. The enemy intention
DOCTOR: The enemy intention is to occupy your planet. I should have thought that was quite obvious.
BRIGADIER: To do that they will have to land additional forces. In other words, this is no more than a diversionary thrust. Do you agree, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, I should have thought that was pretty obvious too, isn't it?
BRIGADIER: We have, as you know, raided the circus and arrested Rossini and his thugs. And what have we learned from them?
DOCTOR: Nothing. Rossini is just a tool. The Master used him and then discarded him.
BRIGADIER: There was no sign of alien activity at the circus. This mysterious horsebox had vanished. So had the Autons.
DOCTOR: Naturally. Oh, you have finished with me now, I hope?
BRIGADIER: Not quite.
DOCTOR: Oh.
BRIGADIER: I therefore propose that we redouble our security here and concentrate on finding the Master's headquarters.
DOCTOR: Oh, well, having reached that brilliant conclusion, how about getting on with it? Captain Yates, is my car back yet?
YATES: Safe and sound, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh good, that's something anyway.
BRIGADIER: Any further comments, Doctor?
DOCTOR : I'll let you know as soon as I think of any.
BRIGADIER: Captain Yates, we will continue this conference in my office.
DOCTOR: Do you know, Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms.
JO: You're not very grateful, are you?
DOCTOR: What? For having my time wasted?
JO: He did save our lives, you know. Well? Didn't he?
DOCTOR: You're quite right, Jo. I'll apologise, if I have the time.
JO: What are those things?
DOCTOR: Well, that is the discarded circuit from my Tardis and this is an identical circuit that I, er, borrowed from the Master's horsebox.
JO: What does it do?
DOCTOR: You wait there and I'll show you.
DOCTOR: Bye bye, Jo.
JO: Doctor, where are you going?
DOCTOR : Just a proving flight.
JO: Doctor! What's happening?
DOCTOR: Of all the stupid useless.
JO: Doctor. Doctor, stop being childish.
DOCTOR: What's wrong with being childish? I like being childish.
JO: What were you trying to do anyway?
DOCTOR: Well, my Tardis uses a mark one dematerialisation circuit and I tried to replace it with a mark two.
JO: What's the joke?
DOCTOR: Well, I've just thought of something. My Tardis might not work, but neither will his now. Wherever he is, he's trapped on Earth.
MASTER: Farrel, be careful. Careful. I don't want an accident.
FARREL: I was admiring the workmanship.
MASTER: Do you think people will be impressed?
FARREL: They're the finest plastic flowers I've ever seen.
MASTER: Yes, well, that's our object. To show the world the skill of the modern plastics industry.
AUTON: We're ready, Farrel. We must drive to the next distribution centre.
FARREL: No! The Master must be obeyed! Must be obeyed.
AUTON: We will wait a little longer. If he's not then returned, we shall drive on.
MASTER : You will obey me, Farrel. I am your Master.
DOCTOR:  From field section one. Continuous watch maintained. Nothing to report. Business appears to be proceeding normally. No unusual activity. Everything checked and found in order. Report completely negative. Nothing to report so far. Will continue to search. It's worthless! Absolutely worthless!
JO: Now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Days of exhaustive investigation by the Brigadier's band of bloodhounds and what have they discovered? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The incompetent imbeciles.
JO: We're doing everything possible, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No news from any of those plastic factories?
JO: Well, there were those reports of a promotional tour.
DOCTOR: My dear girl, the Master is scarcely likely to advertise what he's doing.
JO: I suppose not.
DOCTOR: I will not give up. He's lying low somewhere and we've got to find him.
JO: Maybe he's given up.
DOCTOR: The Master? Never! He's too conceited.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, this is Mister Brownrose from the Ministry. He's come to us with a rather alarming story.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm not in the mood for stories.
BROWNROSE: Is this man a member of your staff?
BRIGADIER: The Doctor acts as our scientific consultant, yes. His assistant, Miss Grant.
BROWNROSE: How do you do. I hope he's qualified to deal with a matter of this complexity.
DOCTOR: I think you'll find, sir, that I'm qualified to deal with practically everything, if I choose.
BROWNROSE: I must say, Brigadier, I'm far from satisfied that you've grasped the urgency of this matter.
BRIGADIER: I assure you I have.
BROWNROSE: It's not something to be shuffled off onto some stray boffin, you know.
DOCTOR: Now just a moment, my good man. We at UNIT are very busy with a number of extremely urgent matters.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, please.
DOCTOR: The Brigadier has a great deal on his plate. You cannot expect his exclusive attention for your petty concerns.
BROWNROSE: Oh, can't I sir? Now, I'll have you know that my
DOCTOR: Who's in charge of you pen pushers these days? Old Tubby Rowlands isn't it?
BROWNROSE: Lord Rowlands is head of our department, yes.
DOCTOR: I was saying to him in the Club only the other day, wrong sort of chap is creeping into your lot, Tubby, I said.
BROWNROSE: Well, of course, I didn't mean to imply anything offensive.
DOCTOR: No. No, of course not. Say no more about it. Right now, Brigadier, what's your problem?
BRIGADIER: Pretty serious, Doctor. A wave of sudden deaths all over the Home Counties.
DOCTOR: Cause?
BROWNROSE: Asphyxiation, heart failure, shock.
BRIGADIER: In other words, no satisfactory explanation at all.
BROWNROSE: I'm afraid not.
JO: Some kind of virus?
BROWNROSE: There's no evidence of infection.
DOCTOR: Any connection between the victims?
BROWNROSE: None whatsoever. Different ages, sexes and occupations. Apart from the first two deaths, there's no connection at all.
DOCTOR: What about the first two?
BROWNROSE: Well, the first was a man called McDermott, the second, Farrel.
JO: Farrel?
BROWNROSE: Production Manager and retired owner of the same plastics factory.
DOCTOR: Mrs Farrel, I do realise how distressing this must be for you.
MRS FARREL: I've already been over it with the police.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. Believe me, it is terribly important, you know. You could help us save hundreds of lives.
JO: Would you like us to come back another time?
MRS FARREL: No dear, I'll be all right. Well, I'd gone to make the coffee after lunch, but I heard a noise. I came in and found him.
JO: Your husband seemed quite normal when you left him? I mean not ill or anything?
MRS FARREL: Well, he was a little worried and depressed, I think, but he certainly wasn't ill.
JO: Did he say why he was depressed?
MRS FARREL: Oh, the death of Mister McDermott upset him, of course, and I do know he was very disturbed about developments within the firm.
DOCTOR: What sort of developments?
MRS FARREL: Well, he seemed to think that Rex, our son, he seemed to think that he'd fallen too much under the influence of a new customer. My husband didn't like him at all.
DOCTOR: What was his name?
MRS FARREL: Colonel Masters.
DOCTOR: I knew it.
YATES: Doctor, did you. Who are you?
ENGINEER: Telephone engineer, sir. Just finishing.
YATES: Got your pass?
ENGINEER: Blimey, not again. I've been checked more times than
YATES: Pass. Thank you. Okay, fine. Why such a long flex?
ENGINEER: Specially ordered, sir. Perhaps the gent likes to walk up and down while he's talking.
YATES: Sounds very like him.
ENGINEER: That's it then.
DOCTOR: Is there anything else you can tell us about this Colonel Masters?
MRS FARREL: Well, er, I believe he's still working with Rex. I've been too upset to think about the business.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, but can you remember anything that your husband said about him? Anything at all?
MRS FARREL: I don't think so. Oh, John did bring one of the new dolls home to examine.
DOCTOR: What sort of dolls?
MRS FARREL: Well, wasn't my idea of a doll at all.
DOCTOR: Could we see it, Mrs Farrel?
MRS FARREL: Yes of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
JO: Yes, I see what you mean.
MRS FARREL: It wasn't intended for children, naturally. Some sort of a novelty for grown ups, I suppose. It's odd, you know.
DOCTOR: What is?
Mrs FARREL: Well, when I went out of the room, that thing was on the radiator by the door.
DOCTOR: Yes?
MRS FARREL: But after they'd taken John away, I found it under the curtains. It was as if it was trying to get out.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, lets take a look at this thing.
YATES: Charming little chap, isn't he. Where did you get it?
DOCTOR: Scalpel.
DOCTOR: Forceps.
JO: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: I'm just poking about. Oh, it appears to be made of solid plastic.
BRIGADIER: Why would they make a thing like that solid?
DOCTOR: Why indeed? Let's try the head. Oh. That appears to be solid plastic, too. It's no good, I'll have to make a full analysis.
YATES: Where'd you pick it up?
JO: From the house of a man called Farrel.
YATES: Why bring it here?
JO: Well, the Doctor seems to think it might have killed him.
DOCTOR: Jo, get in touch with scientific supplies, will you? Tell them I need these things straight away.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, how on earth could a thing like that kill anybody?
DOCTOR: That, Brigadier, is what I'm trying to find out.
JO: Hello, scientific supplies section?
BRIGADIER: Do you have the result of the post mortem?
JO: I have a requisition for you, top priority.
DOCTOR: Yes, asphyxiation, cause unknown.
YATES: It might have frightened him to death.
JO: Scanning molecular structure analyser.
YATES: But asphyxiation? Well, it's not alive.
JO: Electrode unit.
DOCTOR: The Nestenes change the molecular structure of plastic, Captain Yates. They energise it in some way and turn it into quasi-organic matter, almost like flesh and blood. Well, it's inert at the moment. Something must have activated it.
JO: That's it. Thank you. The equipment's on its way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. How long will it be?
JO: Quite a while, I'm afraid. They've had to send out for most of it.
DOCTOR: What? Do you mean that they haven't got a scanning molecular structure analyser in stock? Oh really, Brigadier. You should keep this place better supplied, you know. I cannot work without proper equipment.
BRIGADIER: I'm very sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, just as well. It'll give me more time to look at Mister Farrel's plastic factory.
BRIGADIER: Now just a moment, Doctor. I'm aware for your preference for acting as a one-man band, but this does happen to be a UNIT operation.
DOCTOR: Lethbridge Stewart, I can assure you
YATES: He's right you know, Doctor. I'd better come with you.
BRIGADIER: No! I shall accompany the Doctor myself. I'm not entirely deskbound yet, you know and I
YATES: Sir
BRIGADIER: That will do, Captain Yates! May I remind you that you're duty officer today. If you're ready, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Jo, nobody is to touch that thing until I've had the chance of examining it properly, all right?
JO: Don't worry, I won't go anywhere near it. Yuk!
AUTON: We will leave now.
FARREL: No, not until the Master returns.
AUTON: We shall leave without him. We must keep to schedule.
FARREL: For the last time, no!
FARREL: Who are you?
YATES: Until you've had a mug of army cocoa, you just haven't lived.
JO: You know, I don't think the Doctor would approve of that.
YATES: What?
JO: Making free with his Bunsen burner. Hello? Scientific supplies section? I'd like to speak to Mister Campbell please.
YATES: Then he shouldn't go gallivanting off leaving me stuck here.
JO: What about me? I'm stuck here too, you know.
YATES: Oh well, that's different, isn't it? I'll just go and fetch the gubbins.
JO: Thank you and good night, Captain Yates. Hello? Mister Campbell? Oh, I see. No, no, I'll hang on. Will he be long?
BRIGADIER: Is anybody there?
JO: Yes, well, the Doctor does need it rather urgently so I thought
JO: Yes, that's quite true, but if anybody could, you could. You're dead right, we'd be in terrible trouble. Could you? Could you really? You're a dolly Scotsman, Mister Campbell. Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: It's open.
JO: Mike! Mike, come quickly!
YATES: Jo! What's the matter?
BRIGADIER: Seems as though they've moved camp.
DOCTOR: Yes. Today.
BRIGADIER: Oh, how do you know that?
DOCTOR: Desk calendar. Hello?
BRIGADIER: What have you got there?
DOCTOR: A daffodil. A plastic daffodil. Hang onto it for me, will you?
BRIGADIER: What do you want it for? They give these things away with soap.
DOCTOR: It's plastic, Brigadier, and any plastic artefact, anything at all, can, in the Nestene sense of the word, be alive. First a doll, then a flower.
BRIGADIER: What are you getting at, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I wish I knew.
DOCTOR: Oh, have a look at that desk, old chap, will you?
BRIGADIER: Yes.
DOCTOR: You never know, there might be something there to give us a lead.
BRIGADIER: Oh, nothing much here. Unless this might be something.
DOCTOR: Mmm?
BRIGADIER: Farrel's ordered a coach this week. A fifteen-seater.
DOCTOR: Well, maybe he's going on a works outing.
BRIGADIER: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Look out! Auton!
DOCTOR: Remarkably persistent, aren't they.
BRIGADIER: This thing actually attacked you?
JO: It was going to if Mike hadn't shot it. It was horrible.
BRIGADIER: Seems as though you may be right, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I usually am.
BRIGADIER: Well, it's dead enough now.
DOCTOR: Jo, where were you when this thing started moving?
JO: I was on the telephone.
DOCTOR: And what about you, Captain Yates?
YATES: I wasn't here. I'd just gone out to, er, fetch some cocoa.
DOCTOR: Yes, well something must have. Fetch a tin of what?
YATES: Cocoa.
DOCTOR: Are you trying to tell me that you were going to make cocoa in my lab?
YATES: That was the general idea. I'm sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, Sergeant.  Now wait a minute. You didn't by any chance use my bunsen burner, did you?
YATES: Well, yes.
DOCTOR: Well that's it then. Heat! This thing was lying alongside my bunsen. It must be triggered off by a pre-determined temperature.
BRIGADIER: Yes, that may account for Farrel's death, Doctor. What about all the others?
DOCTOR: If this thing is what I think it is, we may have the answer right here. Right, off you go, the whole lot of you.
JO: Me, too?
DOCTOR: Yes, you too. No. No, you go down to the stores and see if you can chase up that Mister Campbell, all right?
JO: Okay.
DOCTOR: Hello, yes? What is it?
MASTER: Hello, Doctor. Is that you?
DOCTOR: Who is this? What do you want?
MASTER: Simply to say goodbye, Doctor.
Episode Four
DOCTOR : Help, Brigadier! Help!
DOCTOR: The cable. Pull it out! Pull it out!
BRIGADIER: You all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, more or less.
BRIGADIER: I'm afraid I cut your connection.
DOCTOR: Oh, very amusing.
BRIGADIER: What happened?
DOCTOR: Well, remember what I told you, Brigadier? The Nestenes can put life into anything made of plastic. Anything at all.
BRIGADIER: I see. And there's a lot of plastic around.
YATES: Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, I was wrong. It isn't heat. Well?
YATES: Message from the Brigadier.
DOCTOR: What is it this time?
YATES: It's about these daffodils.
DOCTOR: What about them?
YATES: You remember we had a report of a plastics promotion tour?
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm.
YATES: Well, er, they're handing out daffodils.
DOCTOR: Who are?
YATES: Chaps in weird carnival masks, touring round in a coach.
DOCTOR: Did they say how many they'd given out?
YATES: No, they didn't. We've got no idea at all, I'm afraid. We don't even know how long they've been doing it. The thing is, the Brigadier wants to know if the daffs are dangerous.
DOCTOR: That, Captain Yates, is what I'm trying to find out.
BRIGADIER: Excellent. Where was it? Well, give me the grid reference. Yeah. No, just maintain contact. I want to tackle them in open country. Good. Keep me informed.
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart here, I want a call to the RAF please. Priority red one. Strike command.
DOCTOR: Excuse me, Jo.
JO: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: This is a section of that daffodil. I'm trying to find out its molecular structure.
DOCTOR: No.
DOCTOR: Hello, what's this? A programme pattern.
JO: A programme pattern?
DOCTOR: Yes, these daffodils have their instructions imprinted on every cell. It's a weapon of some sort, but what sort?
JO: Well, will those signs help you find out?
DOCTOR: They will if I can translate them.
DOCTOR: My word, you look very fierce.
BRIGADIER: We've located that coach load of Nestene Autons distributing those daffodils, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good.
BRIGADIER: They're hiding in that same quarry where they took you.
DOCTOR: Well, that's curious. Was the Master with them?
BRIGADIER: I couldn't say. You might be able to identify him afterwards.
DOCTOR: Afterwards?
BRIGADIER: I've got the RAF to lay on a rocket strike. In a few hours time, that coach should be a pile of scrap iron.
DOCTOR: The military mind at its most scintillating. Faced with a problem they blast it off the face of the earth.
JO: What do you think we should do?
DOCTOR: Nothing. Keep them under observation for a while and give me a chance to find out the purpose of these flowers.
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Doctor. I can't afford to take that risk. If that coach moves to a populated area, it'll be impossible to destroy it. The strike will go ahead as planned.
DOCTOR: Captain Yates?
YATES: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: How long have we got?
YATES: About an hour and a half. The RAF boys are setting things up now and we have established an observation point at the quarry.
JO: Mike, can we reach you there?
YATES: Sure. We'll be in radio contact with HQ and with the RAF. You can get us on one of these.
YATES: See you, Doc. Bye, Jo.
DOCTOR: An hour and a half.
FARREL: Everything seems quiet.
AUTON: The humans are watching us.
FARREL: How do you know?
AUTON: We were followed to this place.
JO: But won't that programme pattern be a Nestene?
DOCTOR: Yes, well done. That's why I'm converting it to visual symbols. Ah, here it comes.
JO: That's a face. A part of one.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, a nose and a mouth.
JO: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: I've no idea.
JO: So what next?
DOCTOR: Well, if it is a weapon, we must find out what triggers it off. Jo, get in touch with the Brigadier, will you? See if he can hold up that air strike. I must have more time.
JO: Hello, Greyhound. This is Trap One. Do you read me? Over.  There seems to be something wrong. Hello, Greyhound. This is Trap One. Do you read me? Over.
DOCTOR: Jo, look!
JO: It's alive!
DOCTOR: Short wave radio. You must have triggered it off with that walkie-talkie. Of course. They must be planning to set them all off at once with a gigantic radio signal. If I could only find out the direction of the signal.
JO: It seems to be looking for something.
DOCTOR: Jo, be careful. Jo!
DOCTOR: It's all over. You all right?
JO: Just a bit short of breath. What happened?
DOCTOR: Well, your nose and mouth were sealed off with this.
JO: What's that?
DOCTOR: Plastic film. You would have been unconscious in two minutes, dead in under ten.
JO: So all those people were killed by the daffodils?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, they must have triggered them off accidentally, just as you did. Jo, do something for me, will you?
JO: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Get in touch with that idiot Brownrose. See if plastic daffodils were found at the scenes of any of those deaths. Oh, and ask him if anybody was using short wave radios, will you?
JO: Okay.
DOCTOR: You all right?
JO: Fine, Doctor. And thank you.
BENTON: Thank you, Eagle. Message confirmed. Over and out. That's it then, sir. Air strike confirmed.
BRIGADIER: Right.
YATES: No word from the Doctor then, sir?
BRIGADIER: No. The air strike's due to begin in thirty seven minutes. If the Doctor's coming up with anything, he'd better be quick.
DOCTOR: Now why wasn't this stuff found on the bodies?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Dissolved by carbon dioxide from the lungs.
MASTER: Good afternoon, Doctor.
MASTER: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
DOCTOR: No, no, indeed not. You've come here to kill me, of course.
MASTER: But not without considerable regret.
DOCTOR: How very comforting.
MASTER: You see, Doctor, you're my intellectual equal. Almost. I have so few worth opponents. When they've gone, I always miss them.
DOCTOR: How did you get in here?
MASTER: Oh, don't be trivial, Doctor. I see you've been working on the Nestene autojet. My own small contribution to their invasion plan.
DOCTOR: Vicious, complicated and inefficient. Typical of your way of thinking.
MASTER: Now, come, come, Doctor. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly.
DOCTOR: Tell me, how do you intend to activate these flowers?
MASTER: Oh, by a radio impulse which the Nestenes will send. I shall open the channel for them. We've distributed four hundred and fifty thousand of these daffodils, so when four hundred and fifty thousand people fall dead, the country will be disrupted.
DOCTOR: And in the confusion the Nestenes will land their invasion force.
MASTER: Exactly. It's a shame that you can't be here to enjoy the chaos and destruction with me. Goodbye, Doctor.
JO: You were quite right
DOCTOR: Wait! Don't shoot.
MASTER: Doctor, you do disappoint me. We Time Lords are expected to face death with dignity.
JO: Oh, no!
DOCTOR: Don't worry. He's not going to kill me.
MASTER: That is your last mistake.
DOCTOR: If you fire that thing, you will never be able to leave this planet.
MASTER: You're bluffing on an empty hand, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm not bluffing and my hand, as you can see, is not empty. If you kill me, you will destroy the dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis. You recognise it, I feel sure.
MASTER: Where did you get that?
DOCTOR: The circus.
MASTER: You underestimate me, Doctor. Let me be quite plain. Either you hand that unit over to me now, or I kill Miss Grant.
DOCTOR: Touch�.
JO: Don't! He's beaten already! They're going to bomb the quarry.
DOCTOR: Jo!
MASTER: Oh. There's been a slight change of plan, Doctor. I've decided to let you live, for a little while.
YATES: Not long now, sir.
FARREL: What's happening out there?
AUTON: The humans are planning to attack us.
FARREL: We should try and leave.
AUTON: We shall leave soon. Our task is not yet completed.
FARREL: He's left us! He's deserted!  How did I get here? I'm not part of this!
BRIGADIER: Twenty nine, twenty eight.
YATES: Look, sir.
BRIGADIER: Benton, stop that air strike!
BENTON: It's too late, sir.
BRIGADIER: Well try, man, try!
BENTON: Eagle, Eagle, Eagle. Abort, abort, abort!
MASTER: Now, tie these two up.
BRIGADIER: Not a sign of life down there.
YATES: What do we do if they try to move out?
BRIGADIER: I don't know.
MASTER: Farrel?
AUTON: Farrel became undependable.
MASTER: Did he? His father would have been proud of him.
JO: Ow!
MASTER: Yes, Miss Grant, they are a little heavy handed. I apologise for your last moments on earth being so uncomfortable, Doctor.
MASTER: Thank you. Right, you come with me.
MASTER: Now, because of the change in circumstances, we're going to have to bring our schedule forward. What we're going to do is this. It's absolutely essential that we
DOCTOR: Jo, you know where we are, don't you.
JO: Roughly, why?
DOCTOR: We're just three or four miles from that radio telescope.
JO: So?
DOCTOR: The Master will activate the daffodils from there.
JO: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: We've got to warn UNIT. If I can just reach these brake pedals.
JO: Doctor, if you're going to drive, I want to get off.
DOCTOR: No. I only hope the Brigadier's keeping his eyes open. Got it!
YATES: Sir! Sir! The brake lights are flashing.
BRIGADIER: Yes, you're right. Somebody's signalling.
YATES: The Doctor!
BRIGADIER: Benton?
BENTON: Yes, sir?
BRIGADIER: Get this down. E S T
JO: Do you think they're getting it?
DOCTOR: If I can just keep trying.
BRIGADIER: I O N. That's it. Read that back, Benton.
BENTON: Daffodils are lethal. Activated soon. Destroy immediately. Guard radio research station.
BRIGADIER: Benton, send an alert to the civil police. I want radio and TV warnings, loudspeaker vans, house to house, the lot.
BENTON: Right away, sir.
BRIGADIER: Captain Yates, rustle up every available man and put a guard on that radio research station.
BENTON: Hello, Bluebottle Three. This is Greyhound. Do you read me?
BRIGADIER: I'll stay here with the coach.
BENTON: Do you read me? Over.
DOCTOR: Jo, it's a pity escapology wasn't part of your curriculum.
JO: Funny you should say that. Look.
DOCTOR: Well done!
JO: Careful!
MASTER: I hope that you two have enjoyed your little rest. Right, the time has come for our final move.
BRIGADIER: They're on the move. Come on, Benton.
BENTON: Right, sir.
DOCTOR: That's it, I'm free.
DOCTOR: If he slows down, we might be able to jump for it.
JO: Right.
YATES: Right, take your positions! Quick!
MASTER: Get back, Farrel!
MASTER: Let go!
DOCTOR: Are you all right?
JO: It's my ankle.
AUTON: The two humans have escaped.
MASTER: Never mind about them! I must get to the radio telescope. 
AUTON: The Autojets are being destroyed. It's too late.
MASTER: No! Get out there, all of you. Keep those soldiers back!
DOCTOR: Brigadier, those daffodils
JO: Doctor, look!
DOCTOR: The radio telescope! We must stop him reaching the control. He'll open the channel for the Nestenes.
BRIGADIER: Benton, get a stretcher party. And get some more men.
BENTON: Right, sir.
DOCTOR: It's locked.
BRIGADIER: Stand back, Doctor.
MASTER: Too late, Doctor. The Nestenes are here.
MASTER: An amateur landing, of course. Not the way I planned it.
DOCTOR: If only we could shut off the power.
MASTER: Impossible. They've taken control. No one can stop them now. Your precious little planet is finished.
DOCTOR: If we're finished, then you're finished too.
MASTER: Nonsense! I helped them to come here. 
DOCTOR: Do you really think that that thing will distinguish between you and us?
BENTON: It's no good, sir. We just can't hold them.
BRIGADIER: Can't you do anything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not unless we change the polarity.
MASTER: Whilst the transfer shift is still open?
DOCTOR: It will fling them right out into space.
MASTER: You're right!
BRIGADIER: Well, you'd better try it and quick!
DOCTOR: Get on to the transfer bank. I'll switch the power through. Are you ready?
MASTER: Yes!
DOCTOR: Right, now!
 
BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor, it worked.
DOCTOR: Yes, but only just. Another minute and we'd have been too late.
BRIGADIER: He's gone!
DOCTOR: After him, quick!
JO: Look!
YATES: Sir! He's in the coach, sir. We've got him now.
DOCTOR: Don't be too sure.
DOCTOR: Don't trust him, Brigadier. It's a trick.
YATES: Well, that's the end of him.
DOCTOR: I told you not to be too sure.
JO: Look out!
BRIGADIER: Well, we found the abandoned coach but the Master disappeared completely.
JO: He's probably left Earth by now.
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
JO: What makes you so sure?
DOCTOR: Well his Tardis can't go anywhere. Not without this.
BRIGADIER: And what the dickens is that?
DOCTOR: That's a dematerialisation circuit. It's very complicated.
JO: So the one he took from you
DOCTOR: Belonged to my Tardis, yes. Yes, I've been trying to repair it for months.
JO: And now he's stuck here on Earth.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm afraid so.
BRIGADIER: Think he'll turn up again, Doctor?
DOCTOR: yes, bound to.
JO: You don't seem very worried about it.
DOCTOR: I'm not. As a matter of fact, Jo, I'm rather looking forward to it.
