The Tomb of the Cybermen
Episode One
DOCTOR: There we are. Well, what do you think?
VICTORIA: I don't know. I can't believe it. It's so big. Where are we?
DOCTOR: Oh, it's the Tardis. It's my home. At least, it has been for a considerable number of years.
VICTORIA: What are all these knobs?
DOCTOR: What, these?
JAMIE: Instruments. These are for controlling our flight.
VICTORIA: Flight?
JAMIE: Well, yes. You see, we travel around in here through time and space.
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no, no. Don't laugh. It's true. Your father and Maxtible were working on the same problem, but I have perfected a rather special model, which enables me to travel through the universe of time.
VICTORIA: How can you? I mean, if what you say is true then you must be, er, well, how old?
DOCTOR: Well, if we count in Earth terms, I suppose I must be about four hundred, yes, about four hundred and fifty years old. Yes, well, quite. Now, I think Victoria might find that dress a little impracticable if she's going to join us in our adventures. Jamie, show her where she can find some new ones, will you?
JAMIE: Aye, right. This way, Victoria. Try to give us a smooth take off, Doctor? We don't want to frighten her.
DOCTOR: A smooth take off? A smooth take off! What a nerve!
PARRY : Hey, Toberman! Get that big head down!
PARRY:  What's the matter with you? Have you gone mad?
VINER:  The fool. Doesn't he realise the danger he's in? It's nothing to laugh at. None of us knows what's going to happen when we press that thing, especially in this rarified atmosphere.
PARRY: All right. Viner, no need to get excited.  Can't you keep your servant under control?
KAFTAN:  If I wish, I can.
HOPPER:  Hurry it up, will you, Rogers! I don't know what you think you're going to find anyway.
PARRY: According to the map reference now, that should be the entrance to the city of Telos.
HOPPER: I hope you're right, because I want to get out of here.
KLIEG:  Let me remind you, Mister Hopper, that you are being more than well paid for your part in this expedition.
HOPPER: Oh, big deal.
ROGERS:  Sorry. We had to make it a pretty big one.
PARRY: All right, let's get on with it. We've wasted enough time.
PARRY: Stand by. Everybody down!
PARRY: Oh no.
HOPPER: Well, there you go. You blast yourself one lump of rock and all you've got is another.
ROGERS: No, wait a minute, look!
HOPPER: Man, you just blew yourself a pair of doors.
PARRY: Well, come on. What are we waiting for?
KAFTAN: Fifty pounds for the first man to open the doors.
PARRY: Miss Kaftan, I must remind you that I am the leader of this
PARRY: What happened?
KLIEG: I don't know.
HOPPER: Well, one thing for sure, he's not going to collect fifty pounds from you or anybody else.
VINER: Quiet. Quiet a minute.
PARRY: What's it?
VINER: It sounded like an engine. Something came down over there behind that rock.
HOPPER: Okay, Viner, slow down, I'll take care of this. Jim, behind that rock.
CALLUM:  Okay, I've got it.
HOPPER: Hold it right there, friend.
DOCTOR: If you put it like that, I certainly will.
CALLUM: Did you hear that, Professor? English.
PARRY: Yes. All right, Hopper.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PARRY: Who are you and where do you come from?
HOPPER: And you'd better have a good story.
JAMIE: Maybe you'll not get one.
HOPPER: Listen, fella, we're not playing games.
ROGERS: You'd better listen to him.
DOCTOR: Now what's been happening over here?
KLIEG: He was killed the moment you made your appearance.
DOCTOR: Ah, and you think we did it? Oh, no. I can assure you that we had nothing to do with the death of this man. He appears to have been electrocuted. Trying to open these doors perhaps?
ROGERS: He seems to know all the answers.
HOPPER: A wise guy.
VINER: I think this fellow must be the member of a rival expedition.
DOCTOR: Expedition?
PARRY: We've tried to keep it a secret. Unsuccessfully now it appears.
VINER: Look at him. Archaeologist written all over him.
DOCTOR: Really? Does it show?
VINER: There, you see? It's impossible to keep a secret in the scientific world.
VICTORIA: Doctor, what do you mean?
JAMIE: Tell them, Doctor. Go on, tell them.
DOCTOR: No. Not until they tell me what the purpose of their expedition.
PARRY: This is an archaeological expedition. We're searching the universe for the last remains of the Cybermen.
JAMIE: Cybermen? You mean to say they came from here?
PARRY: But of course. Telos was their home. This is the entrance to their city.
VINER: We know they died out many centuries ago. What we don't know is why they died out.
HOPPER: Callum, Rogers, get him back to the rocket. I'll be with you in a minute.
CALLUM: Okay.
HOPPER: Well, that's that. Are you coming back to the rocket with me, Professor?
PARRY: What for?
HOPPER: You're not going on with this, are you? Look I don't know if these people have anything to do with it or not, but one of my men has just been killed. You're not paying that kind of money.
PARRY: Yes, I suppose that's quite true.
HOPPER: Yeah, you think it over. Come on, let's go. We'll wait for you back at the ship.
DOCTOR: The problem, I take it, is to open these doors, right?
KLIEG: Ha, brilliant.
PARRY: That is the problem.
KLIEG: And we would prefer it if you returned to wherever you came from.
JAMIE: Oh, not very friendly, are they, Doctor?
VICTORIA: Oh yes, do as he says.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid that that became impossible the moment that name was mentioned.
VICTORIA: What name?
DOCTOR: Cybermen.
VICTORIA: Cybermen? What are they?
VINER: I knew they were here on the same quest.
PARRY: No one would come here for any other reason.
DOCTOR: We must stay.
JAMIE: Oh, Doctor!
VICTORIA: Oh, must we? I don't like the look of those things at all.
DOCTOR: We shall stay and help you with your search.
KLIEG: Perhaps we don't want your help.
DOCTOR: That's just it, you so obviously do. Now I'm sure we can agree. I can open those doors for you.
KLIEG: It is our problem, and I suggest you take this ridiculous expedition of yours off this planet.
JAMIE: It seems to me that we've got as much right here as you have.
PARRY: Of course you have. Mister Klieg, must I remind you again that you do not speak for this expedition? I am it's leader, you and Miss Kaftan are only here on sufferance.
KLIEG: Thank you. And whose money is paying for the hire of that rocket?
KAFTAN: Mine!
PARRY: I thought I made it quite clear that your financial support did not entitle you to a say in the running of this expedition.
KAFTAN: Of course it was quite clear. Was it not, Eric?
KLIEG: Of course. No one questions your leadership.
DOCTOR: Ah, good, that's all settled. And now we shall open these doors.
JAMIE: What?
PARRY: Careful, man!
HAYDON: Hey look out!
VICTORIA: Doctor!
DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe now.
PARRY: You'll be killed!
HAYDON: No, don't touch him!
DOCTOR: I'm afraid it's beyond my strength.
JAMIE: Let me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Jamie.
JAMIE: Aye, well, I've not had much exercise lately.
DOCTOR: Quite. I think here is a gentleman who can open these doors for us.
KAFTAN: He is my servant. I will not have him risk his life.
PARRY: Surely it was for just such a contingency as this that you insisted we bring him with us?
DOCTOR: Oh, there's no danger now. Unless of course he's afraid.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, he's not afraid.
PARRY: Come on.
DOCTOR: No, wait, wait. I would be very careful in there if I were you.
HAYDON: But why wasn't Toberman killed? Why weren't you killed?
DOCTOR: The poor fellow who died drained all there electricity out of his body. It's perfectly safe to go in there now.
KLIEG: Come on, then. We're wasting time. Of course. After you, Professor.
DOCTOR: But I'd still. I'd still be very careful if I were you. Very careful indeed! Come on, let's go and join them. Come on, Victoria.
DOCTOR: You look very nice in that dress, Victoria.
VICTORIA: Thank you. Don't you think it's a bit
DOCTOR: A bit short? Oh, I shouldn't worry about that. Look at Jamie's.
JAMIE: Hey, I'll have you know that. Oh, aye.
DOCTOR: Come along. Come along. Let's go and see what the others are doing, shall we? Come along.
VICTORIA: Mercy, just look at this place.
VINER: These controls are of their earlier dynasty.
HAYDON: Not so very early as all that by the look of it. Look, John.
VINER: Yes, I'm quite capable of making my own deductions, thank you.
HAYDON: All right.
KLIEG: Be careful. There might be danger in there.
KAFTAN: Don't worry, with Toberman to guard me. What is more important is to keep an eye on these strangers.
KLIEG: Well I tried to
KAFTAN: Do not raise your voice. You will achieve nothing by shouting. You look after the Doctor and I will watch the girl.
KLIEG: And the Scots boy?
KAFTAN: Leave him to Toberman. Ay, Toberman? But you will be careful and discreet, understand?
TOBERMAN: I understand.
JAMIE: Did you ever seen the like of it Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not exactly, Jamie, but very nearly.
PARRY: Now that we're all here. Now that we're all here, I think we'd better take stock of the situation. This appears to be a dead end. The only way out appears to be through that hatch.
KAFTAN: Are there no doors?
PARRY: No, apart from the entrance.
DOCTOR: And the other two, of course.
VINER: Two other doors?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. One in that section, and one in that section over there. Activated, I imagine, by this simple logical system over here. Here we are, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, splendid, splendid. A simple logical gate.
KLIEG: Doctor, you seem to be very familiar with this place.
DOCTOR: Oh no, not really. It's all based upon symbolic logic, the same as you use in computers. The opening mechanism for this door, an OR gate. you call it.
KLIEG: Yes, yes, I can see that, but how did you know in the first place?
DOCTOR: Oh, I use my own special technique.
KLIEG: Oh really, Doctor? And may we know what that is?
DOCTOR: Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut.
PARRY: We're far too many to explore together. I think we'd better divide up. If you, Mister Viner would take that door with er
JAMIE: Jamie.
PARRY: Jamie and Mister Haydon. Mister Klieg, the Doctor and myself will make up the other party.
VICTORIA: Well, what about us?
PARRY: I think the women had better remain here.
VICTORIA: Oh, rubbish. We can make a party.
KAFTAN: Certainly. With Toberman to guard us we need fear no one.
PARRY: Right. Mister Klieg, will you take them along with you?
KLIEG: I prefer to stay here.
PARRY: As you wish. Mister Viner, will you go along with the women?
VINER: If you like.
PARRY: But get back to the spacecraft by 1630. You all know the temperature drop at night, so we'll meet back here at 1625. If anyone is missing that'll give us an hour to look for them before we have to leave.
VINER: Come on, then. we might as well try that opening over there.
KAFTAN: We'd better keep close together.
VICTORIA: I'm all right thank you.
HAYDON: Come on, Jamie.
JAMIE: Right.
PARRY: Now to concentrate on this, whatever it is. This hatch must lead somewhere and there must be some opening mechanism. What was that about symbolic logic? Any ideas?
DOCTOR: No, not really. I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg a chance to show off his archaeological skills? I love to see the experts at work, don't you?
VINER: Come on. Right in. Where's Toberman?
KAFTAN: I sent him to join the others. We do not need any other protection now that you are with us.
VINER: Yes, well, shall we commence? Everything must be carefully measured and recorded.
VICTORIA: What is this room?
VINER: I don't know. Possibly this is where the Cybermen are made.
VICTORIA: I wonder what this is.
VINER: Do you mind? You're getting in my way. Just go over there, will you?
VICTORIA: Oh, fiddle!
KAFTAN: Could this not be the purpose of the room?
VINER: Yes?
KAFTAN: A Cyberman would stand in that form and be, well, revitalised?
VINER: Yes, that's reasonable. These projectors were probably made to fire in neuro-electric potential. Yes, that's it, I think you're right.
VICTORIA: Revitalising is just what I need.
VICTORIA: Oh mercy, the Cybermen must have been giants.
VINER: Will you please be careful. The first rule of archaeological work is that nothing must be touched until its been described and recorded.
JAMIE: Hey, you know, it's just struck me. All the corridors in here are as light as day, yet there are no windows.
HAYDON: Alpha-meson phosphor.
JAMIE: Eh?
HAYDON: It's a lighting system that never goes out. Works by letting cosmic rays bombard a layer of barium.
JAMIE: Oh aye, that.
HAYDON: Point is, what was this room used for?
JAMIE: Well, possibly for raising caterpillars, like this one.
HAYDON: Hey, for heavens sake watch out until we know what it is.
JAMIE: Och, it's as dead as a stone.
PARRY: Well?
KLIEG: Well, the basis of this code is binary to digital conversion with a intervening step involving a sort of Whitehead logic.
Well, when this Burrier series is complete, there is no more to be done.
DOCTOR: Yes, but why do it at all?
PARRY: Really, Doctor, for an archaeologist you seem to be curiously lacking in curiosity.
DOCTOR: Some things are better left undone, and I have a feeling that this is one of them.
KLIEG: What do you mean by that?
DOCTOR: Well, it's all too easy, isn't it?
KLIEG: Easy?
PARRY: I wouldn't call this an easy survey, would you, Klieg?
KLIEG: Everything here is designed to keep their secrets, whatever they are, insoluble.
DOCTOR: Insoluble?
KLIEG: But take this
DOCTOR: Oh, I wouldn't say that.
KLIEG: But take this mathematical sequence, for example. I'm really no nearer to it's solution. I've tried every possible combination. You'd hardly call that easy!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, what you've done here is mostly right.
KLIEG: Why, thank you.
DOCTOR: You see, if you take any progressive series it can be converted into binary notation. If you take the sum of the integrants, and express the result as a power series, then the indices show the basic binary blocks. Only I wouldn't do it if I were you. Oh no, I really wouldn't do it!
KLIEG: Of course. You're right.
KLIEG: Look! Sum between limits of one and nine one integral into power series. Yes! yes! Then you differentiate
DOCTOR: You fool! Why couldn't you leave it alone!
PARRY: What's happening?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Perhaps the Cybermen aren't quite as dormant as you imagine. We must find out what has happened to the others.
VINER: Did you touch anything?
KAFTAN: No!
VINER: Well, keep away from that board. Here, help me.
KAFTAN: One moment.
VINER: Now!
VINER: We'll need a crowbar to get this off.
KAFTAN: It may already be too late.
JAMIE: That's strange.
HAYDON: What?
JAMIE: I could swear that that thing moved.
HAYDON: You're seeing things, old chap! Come and look at this. The whole control panel is active suddenly. I don't know which button to press first.
JAMIE: Oh, I wouldn't touch it if I were you.
HAYDON: I think I'll try this one. Nothing.
JAMIE: Hey, wait a minute. What's happening? It's getting dark. Hey, look at the far wall!
VINER: It's no use. I daren't touch anything. If I operate the wrong sequence, she'll die. I must find the logical order. If it's not too late.
KAFTAN: She's still alive!
VINER: Thank heavens. Look, I'd better go and get the others, You stay her with her.
KAFTAN: Yes, but hurry.
VINER: I won't be long.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't touch the projector controls if I were you. Someone might get hurt.
VINER: There must be some way to release it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is. Now let me see.)
HAYDON: Jamie. Jamie, don't watch it.
JAMIE: I must. I must. I can't seem to take my eyes off it. I don't want to take my eyes off it. I don't want to take my eyes off it.
HAYDON: Stop, Jamie!
JAMIE: Yes, yes, I see it now.
HAYDON: Are you all right?
JAMIE: Oh, where have I been?
HAYDON: You've been under some form of hypnosis.
JAMIE: That's ridiculous. What would the Cybermen want with a hypnotising machine?
HAYDON: Yes, you're right. It must be for something else. Wait a minute. Know what it could be?
JAMIE: What?
HAYDON: Some kind of target. I remember reading about this somewhere. They used to have something like it on Earth years ago.
JAMIE: How does it work? Which bit do you aim at?
HAYDON: There's a subliminal centre which you're trained to see.
JAMIE: Oh, aye. A what?
HAYDON: Come on, lets run the whole thing again and see what happens. But keep your eyes off the wall. Now you work the controls this time and I'll watch.
JAMIE: Right.
HAYDON: Okay, press the buttons.
DOCTOR: Yes I think this is the sequence. Stand by to let her out, will you. And if you, my dear, would stand well clear. Thank you. Right!
DOCTOR: Victoria, are you all right? It's all right. Get your breath. It's all right.
VICTORIA: I, I
DOCTOR: It's all right now.
VICTORIA: I didn't like that very much Doctor!
DOCTOR: No, I don't expect you did. You'll have to be a little more careful in future, won't you. Now, come along. We must go and see whether Jamie is all right. Come along.
PARRY: There must be some way to get that hatch open.
KLIEG: That must be the control to do it.
PARRY: The tombs of the Cybermen must be below ground, together with all their records. If we can't get down there, all our work here and the sacrifice of that unfortunate fellow's life will go in vain.
KLIEG: A great deal more than that
PARRY: Pardon?
KLIEG: Of course. There's only one explanation. The Doctor.
PARRY: Yes?
KLIEG: He didn't give us the complete code. There must be a further sequence to operate that opening mechanism.
PARRY: All right. Well, lets try and find out.
KLIEG: Now, what could it be?
HAYDON: Is that all?
JAMIE: Aye. All except this big button here. What does that do?
HAYDON: I'm not sure, but we'll soon find out. I'm going to trace the source of these shapes. There must be a projector somewhere. Look, when I give the word, press the button.
JAMIE: The big one?
HAYDON: Yes. Maybe it works in conjunction with the others.
JAMIE: Right. Ready when you are.
HAYDON: Okay, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Oh Jamie, don't touch that control!
JAMIE: I already have. What's the matter Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, which one was it?
JAMIE: Which one what?
Episode Two
DOCTOR: What exactly happened here, Jamie? What did you do? What sequence did you use?
JAMIE: Sequence, how do you mean? Oh, you mean these! Oh, well, I just pressed that button and pulled this lever and then that lever there.
PARRY: Doctor, could you spare us a moment? I. Haydon! What's happened?
VINER: He's dead. Don't you see, he's dead? It's this damn building. It's alive. It's watching us! It'll get us all! We've got to leave!
PARRY: All right, Viner. This is terrible. How did it happen?
VINER: We've got to get out this building. It's deadly! They'll kill all of us if we don't get back to rocket.
DOCTOR: They?
VINER: The Cybermen! Didn't you see it?
PARRY: Cybermen? A live Cyberman? My dear Viner, they've been dead for the last five hundred years.
VINER: I tell you it was a Cyberman and it came out of there, that screen thing.
JAMIE: He's right.
VINER: Keep back! Keep back! You'll bring it out again.
DOCTOR: The question is, what killed him.
VINER: But you saw the Cyberman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I saw something.
VINER: Well?
DOCTOR: Poor Haydon was looking at that screen, in the direction we all were, right?
VINER: Of course. Must you state the obvious?
DOCTOR: It's not so obvious when you consider he was shot in the back.
JAMIE: In the back?
PARRY: Are you sure, Doctor?
DOCTOR: See for yourself. Now if the Cybermen didn't shoot him, what did? The answer, I think, lies over here. Jamie?
JAMIE: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Can you remember exactly what you did, what sequence you used?
JAMIE: Oh, I'm not sure, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You must try. I want to repeat it all when I give the word.
JAMIE: Very well, Doctor.
VINER: You're crazy, man. You'll bring that, that thing out again.
DOCTOR: Maybe. I don't know. Now, Jamie, when you're ready.
JAMIE: Anytime, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Now there is a distinct element of risk in what I'm asking you all to do, so if anyone wishes to leave they must do so at once. Not you, Jamie.
VINER: Can't you stop this? He'll kill us all.
DOCTOR: Not if you go back against that wall, in that corner there. Now, please. Right, Jamie.
JAMIE: Careful, Doctor!
DOCTOR: It's all right. I think. I think it's all right now. Yes. You see, it's just a mock up, a model. No, don't touch that. That gun may be wired up too.
PARRY: It's a trap.
DOCTOR: No I don't think so. I think it's a testing room for weapons. This is a purely robotic Cyberman. There's no human material in it at all. He's a target for weapons.
PARRY: Let's get back to the control room with this poor fellow.
VICTORIA: What's that?
JAMIE: Some wee creature I found on the floor there.
VICTORIA: It's a fossil.
DOCTOR: Victoria, be careful. Let me see that.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's certainly inactive, but it's not a fossil. Wait a minute.
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. Yes, it's a Cybermat.
VICTORIA: What's a Cybermat?
DOCTOR: It's one of those. I'd leave it alone if I were you. Come along.
KAFTAN: Well?
TOBERMAN: It is done.
KAFTAN: Good.
KLIEG: I just don't understand this code. This sequence doesn't make complete sense.
KAFTAN: You, a logician, you can't understand it?
KLIEG: But in the time
KAFTAN: You must.
KLIEG: In the time we have.
KAFTAN: We have plenty of time. You will see.
PARRY: Lay him down there.
KAFTAN: What has happened to him?
VINER: There's been a terrible accident. He's been shot!
PARRY: Right, we're all here, it seems. Will you all sit down for a moment?
KAFTAN: Toberman?
TOBERMAN: Yes.
PARRY: Mister Klieg?
KLIEG: Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm working, or have you forgotten the purpose of this expedition?
PARRY: This directly concerns my expedition. You will kindly take your place. Right, I'll come straight to the point. I have reluctantly decided to abandon the expedition and return to Earth.
PARRY: I feel as strongly about it as you. This expedition has been my dream for many years. But there were those like Mister Viner who said that more preparation was needed, more men and equipment. I refused to heed their warnings and the result is that two men have died. I'm sorry, but we must leave at the first available conjunction. We'll take back all we can for further study, of course, but that is my decision and that is what we must do.
KLIEG: I insist that
PARRY: My decision is final! We leave when the north hemisphere is properly tangential, which will be at eighteen forty two. Ah, Captain Hopper. Just the man. Can you be ready to blast off at eighteen forty two?
HOPPER: No.
PARRY: I beg your pardon? Did I hear you right? You are paid to take orders, Captain Hopper.
HOPPER: Not impossible ones, I'm not. It's the fuel pumps. Some character has balled up the lot.
DOCTOR: Or something.
HOPPER: Well, whatever it is, it's practically wrecked our chances of getting off this crummy planet.
VINER: I don't care what any of you say. I utterly refuse. I will not spend the night on this planet.
DOCTOR: I don't think we've got much choice.
VINER: Well, at least we can get out of this sinister building. I've recorded all the necessary details, I suggest we all go back to the rocket.
HOPPER: You make a very bad suggestion, Viner, you know that?
VINER: I insist.
HOPPER: You do a lot of insisting. Well, I'm going to tell you something now. The first guy that set sets foot in my rocketship is going to stop the repair work just like that.
PARRY: How long will it take to get the rocket operational again?
HOPPER: Working non-stop without interruption, maybe seventy two hours.
PARRY: Seventy two hours!
VINER: But that's impossible! We'd all be out of our minds after three days in this place. We must go back on board.
HOPPER: Now look, I can't afford to waste any more time with you guys, but I'll give it to you just once more, all right? Now you may not know this but we practically have to pull that ship apart to fix the damage. And there just isn't room for all of you on board. Especially with you insisting all over the place. No room to work, got it?
PARRY: Yes, of course. I see now.
VINER: It's all right for you. Have you any idea what it's like in this deadly building?
HOPPER: Well it's not exactly peaches back on the ship.
DOCTOR: Captain, you do have another reason for not wanting them back on the ship, don't you?
HOPPER: Yeah. Until I find who broke into that rocket.
DOCTOR: Or what?
HOPPER: Who broke into the rocket. Until then I'm going to keep a round the clock guard on it.
DOCTOR: I see.
HOPPER: I'm going to get off this place with my skin still fitting tight all over, all right?
DOCTOR: All right.
HOPPER: Now, in case it gets cold at night, I've brought these anoraks and some food. I'll let you know when I'm ready to take off.
KLIEG: As we have to stay, we might as well finish our job and fully explore down there. That is, if the Professor has no objection.
PARRY: We have no alternative. it seems.
DOCTOR: Well, but can't we stay here? It seems a pleasant enough room to me.
JAMIE: Hey, you speak for yourself.
KLIEG: Of course you can leave here anytime you please, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I was forgetting. I can, can't I.
VICTORIA: But you're not going to are you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No. Not just yet awhile, no. But you and Jamie can go back to the Tardis if you wish.
VICTORIA: I'll stay with you.
DOCTOR: Jamie?
JAMIE: Oh, I'll stay.
DOCTOR: Good.
DOCTOR: Now, I think it's about time we gave Mister Klieg some help.
KLIEG: Thank you, I think I can manage.
TOBERMAN: Stay!
JAMIE: Hey, let the Doctor past or I'll
JAMIE: Yes, well, let the Doctor past.
DOCTOR: It's all right, Jamie. Your colleague has very strong hands.
KAFTAN: Very strong.
DOCTOR: Enough to do a good deal of damage if let loose in the right place.
PARRY: There's no doubt about it, the major workings lie below. There are metal caverns down there, all interconnected. If only we can get down into them.
KLIEG: That's it! I've got it! Finally, a Boolean function of symbolic logic.
DOCTOR: Logical, yes, but
KAFTAN: Everything yields to logic. Our basic assumption, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Really.
KLIEG: Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of two A.
DOCTOR: I think perhaps your logic is wearing a little thin.
KLIEG: I must have made a mistake. I'll do it again more carefully. Six, cap, B four, if and only if, C is cap function of, ah, that's it, two F not two A.
VICTORIA: The hatch!
KLIEG: I've done it! I've done it!
DOCTOR: Congratulations.
JAMIE: Yeah, but Doctor, you
PARRY: Excellent! Now to work. It'll be extremely cold down there. We shall all need to put on warm clothing. Mister Viner, will you see about the anoraks?
KLIEG: Just a moment. Are we all going down?
PARRY: There is safety in numbers.
KLIEG: The women as well?
PARRY: Oh, they of course will stay up here. In case of trouble, contact the rocket.
VICTORIA: I'm coming down with you.
PARRY: But my dear young lady
VICTORIA: You heard me, Professor. The
DOCTOR: Victoria, you would be much safer up here.
VICTORIA: But, Doctor, I
DOCTOR: And much more use to us.
VICTORIA: I don't see,
DOCTOR: Keep an eye on  things. Please?
VICTORIA: All right.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PARRY: Well, if we're all ready, I shall lead the descent. Be ready to go back the instant I give the word.
KLIEG: You know what to do.
KAFTAN: The hatch?
DOCTOR: Mister Toberman?
KAFTAN: He stays with me.
DOCTOR: Then I stay here too.
KAFTAN: Of course, I am being selfish. His strength will be useful to you down there. He must go down. Go down, Toberman.
DOCTOR: Remember what I said. Be very careful.
KAFTAN: It seems we are to be left alone to wait. Captain Hopper brought some food from the rocket. You would like some?
VICTORIA: Oh, rather. I'm ravenous.
KAFTAN: Roast beef? Roast veal? Chicken?
VICTORIA: Oh, chicken, please
VICTORIA: What on Earth's this?
KAFTAN: What you have asked for. Chicken.
VICTORIA: Thank you, but I'm not very hungry now.
PARRY: Hurry up, there. We've no time to linger. It's extremely cold down here even with these anoraks.
JAMIE: You obviously knew what to expect.
DOCTOR: Well, which way do we go?
KLIEG: I don't know. Let's try this way.
DOCTOR: Yes.
JAMIE: Hey, what on Earth?!
PARRY: Behold, gentlemen. The tombs of the Cybermen!
JAMIE: Tombs? I don't see any tombs.
DOCTOR: In there, Jamie. Frozen forever. All their evil locked away with them. And so it must remain.
KLIEG: Like a gigantic honeycomb. Like bees waiting the signal to arise from their winter sleep.
DOCTOR: A signal that they're never going to get.
VINER: We'd better get busy. Everything must be recorded. It's too cold to remain for long.
KLIEG: Unless we find some way to warm things up.
KAFTAN: You have hardly touched your coffee. It must be cold by now. You would like some more?
VICTORIA: No, thank you. I'm much warmer now.
KAFTAN: That's good.
VICTORIA: I feel so sleepy.
VINER: What was that?
JAMIE: It sounded like the hatch!
JAMIE: It's closed!
VINER: Oh, what's the use. We're trapped down here now. We'll never survive down in this cold. Better get back.
DOCTOR: Well?
VINER: It's closed. What have they done that for? What are they playing at up there?
DOCTOR: Perhaps it wasn't them. Where's Jamie?
VINER: He went up the ladder to try it. Professor. Professor, listen to me, for heaven's sake! The hatch is down again. We're trapped down here.
PARRY: Trapped? But there are some of my party up there. Are you sure?
VINER: Of course I'm sure. You know how heavy that thing is. It's down now. We must do something. I give us a couple of hours in here at the most.
DOCTOR: Mister Klieg doesn't seem to be very worried.
KLIEG: No, I'm not, Doctor.
JAMIE: It won't open and I can't make anybody hear.
VINER: There you are.
KLIEG: There is an easy way out of our situation.
VINER: You've found something?
KLIEG: Of course you're forgetting your logic. If it closes it can be opened, from here.
DOCTOR: Conveniently labelled in symbolic logic, I notice.
KLIEG: Right, are we ready? I shall now operate the sequence.
DOCTOR: If it is the opening device.
KLIEG: It's obviously an opening device of some kind, Doctor.
VINER: I don't know how you can be so blasted calm about it all!
JAMIE: I'll see if it works then.
JAMIE : Go ahead!
JAMIE : Nothing happening out here.
VINER: It doesn't work.
PARRY: Water!
JAMIE: Aye, it's getting warmer.
VINER: The ice is melting.
JAMIE: Hey, look behind you!
VINER: Look! Look at the honeycomb! There's something inside.
JAMIE: They're Cybermen.
DOCTOR: Jamie, come back.
PARRY: It is them. Gentlemen, they are perfect. This is unique in archaeology.
VINER: No. No, they're moving. We must shut it down.
KLIEG: What are you doing? Keep away from that!
VINER: No!
KLIEG: Keep away.
DOCTOR: What do you think you're doing?
KLIEG: I shall not hesitate to kill. For the last time, I'm asking you to get away from those controls.
VINER: No!
PARRY: Viner! Viner, Viner.
PARRY: Viner, you've killed him!
JAMIE: He's mad!
DOCTOR: Jamie!
PARRY: Haydon dead, now Viner. What kind of a man are you?!
KLIEG: Back. Keep back! Let's see what happens. As the Professor says, this is a unique archaeological event. It would be such a pity to miss it.
VICTORIA: What's happened?
KAFTAN: What?
VICTORIA: The hatch is down. Are they back?
KAFTAN: They are still down there.
VICTORIA: Then why is the hatch down? They won't be able to get up again.
KAFTAN: I shall open it when we are ready.
VICTORIA: When who's ready? You closed it?
KAFTAN: I did.
VICTORIA: Then you'd better open it again, hadn't you!
KAFTAN: No, it shall remain closed.
VICTORIA: The Doctor warned me about you.
KAFTAN: That was very clever of him.
VICTORIA: Out of my way!
KAFTAN: Why?
VICTORIA: I'm going to open the hatch.
KAFTAN: Stand back! That's better. Now, let's move away from these controls. We shall be more comfortable over here, I think.
VICTORIA: But why? Why have you done it? You've trapped your friends down there as well as mine!
KAFTAN: I shall open it when Mister Klieg has completed our plans. Meanwhile, it is better that they remain undisturbed. If you touch those controls I shall have to kill you.
JAMIE: You know, Doctor, I have a feeling that man's planned it all. He knew that that control wouldn't open the hatch.
DOCTOR: So did I, Jamie.
JAMIE: You knew, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I wanted to know what he was up to.
KLIEG: And now you know, Doctor.
PARRY: We know nothing. This is the action of a lunatic.
KLIEG: Lunatic? Not at all, Professor. A necessary detail, that's all.
PARRY: But why?
KLIEG: Logic, my dear Professor, logic and power. On Earth the Brotherhood of Logicians is the greatest man intelligence ever assembled. But that's not enough by itself. We need power. Power to put our ability into action. The Cybermen have this power. I have come here to find it and use it.
PARRY: So that was your motive in financing my expedition.
KLIEG: Precisely. Your complete lack of administration made it ideal for our purpose.
DOCTOR: You think the Cybermen will help you?
KLIEG: Of course. I shall be their resurrector.
PARRY: Look!
KAFTAN: Keep still.
VICTORIA: Behind you! That thing, it's come alive!
KAFTAN: You are so simple. You don't really expect to take me in with a trick like that?
VICTORIA: It's true. Look!
KAFTAN: Will nothing keep you still?
VICTORIA: Oh, will you please look!
KAFTAN: If I have any further trouble from you I will have to take drastic steps.
VICTORIA: Why don't you believe me?
KAFTAN: We will not allow a little girl like you to interfere with our plans.
VICTORIA: I don't know.
VICTORIA: Captain Hopper!
JAMIE: What is it?
DOCTOR: I think it's their leader, their Controller, Jamie.
KLIEG: I am Klieg. Eric Klieg. I have brought you back to life. We of the Logicians have planned this. You are alive because of us. Now you will help us. We need your power. You need our mass intelligence. Are you listening? Do you understand me? Now that I have released you
KLIEG: Aaah! Let me go! I set you free! It was our plan!
CONTROLLER: You belong to us. You shall be like us.
Episode Three
PARRY: How did you know that we would come to release you? You could have remained frozen forever.
CONTROLLER: The humanoid mind. You are inquisitive.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see, a trap. A very special sort of trap, too.
PARRY: What do you mean, special trap?
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? They only wanted superior intellects. That's why they made the trap so complicated.
CONTROLLER: We knew that somebody like you would come to our planet one day.
DOCTOR: Yes, and we've done exactly as you've calculated, haven't we?
CONTROLLER: Now you belong to us.
VICTORIA: Now, quick. Find the opening device. I don't know which it is.
HOPPER: Now hold on. I'm not pulling any levers until I know what this is all about.
CALLUM: I don't reckon we should have left the rocket, Captain. I can't see much wrong here.
VICTORIA: Not much wrong? Are you blind, the pair of you? What about this then?
CALLUM: I can't see any change, Vic.
VICTORIA: That's just it. They're down there now.
CALLUM: Then why close the hatch on them?
CALLUM: It doesn't make sense, Vic.
VICTORIA: I didn't. And please stop calling me Vic. She closed the hatch.
CALLUM: Oh, did she now?
VICTORIA: Now look, are you going to help me or not? They're probably freezing to death down there. If you're not going to help me, I'm going to pull every one of those levers on that board and see what happens.
HOPPER: Ah now, I wouldn't do that, Vic. Come on, Jim. I think we'd better do as she says.
CALLUM: Yeah.
HOPPER: Okay, now. Were you here when they opened it all up?
VICTORIA: Yes.
HOPPER: Well, come on. You must have some idea.
VICTORIA: I don't know. I wasn't looking. Oh, I think it's one of those levers down there.
CALLUM: She thinks!
JAMIE: Can we not make a run for it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, no. We wouldn't even reach the ladder. It's too risky.
PARRY: What can we do?
DOCTOR: We'll play for time. Wait our chance. Leave it to me. Excuse me. May I ask a question? Why did you submit yourself to freezing? You don't have to answer that if you don't want to.
CONTROLLER: To survive. Our history computer has full details of you.
DOCTOR: Oh? How?
CONTROLLER: We know of your intelligence.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much. Ah, yes. The lunar surface.
CONTROLLER: Our machinery had stopped and our supply of replacements been depleted.
DOCTOR: So that's why you attacked the Moonbase.
CONTROLLER: You had destroyed our first planet and we were becoming extinct.
JAMIE: What difference does capturing us make? You'll still become extinct.
CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will survive. Now you will help us.
PARRY: What makes you think we're going to help you? That murderer doesn't speak for us.
CONTROLLER: You will become the first of a new race of Cybermen. You will return to the Earth and control it.
PARRY: Never! Never!
CONTROLLER: Everything we decide is carried out. There are no mistakes.
JAMIE: A new race of Cybermen? But we're humans. We're not like you.
CONTROLLER: You will be.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no. Keep away! Keep away! Keep away from me!
DOCTOR: If only you'd let go I'd stand still.
TOBERMAN: Please, please, please let me go! Please, let me go!
DOCTOR: If you would let go of me, I can stand still! You're breaking my arm!
CONTROLLER: To struggle is futile.
HOPPER: You sure that's the one?
CALLUM: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's the only one it could be. Yeah. It leads up to that one there. Yeah.
VICTORIA: Please hurry, Captain Hopper!
HOPPER: Keep back, will you? Leave this to me. Jim, stand by the power cut off.
CALLUM: Power, yeah, yeah.
HOPPER: Stand back, will you, just in case we got the wrong one.
KAFTAN: Don't move! Raise your hands!
HOPPER: Now look here, lady.
KAFTAN: I shall kill you.
HOPPER: Well, your own men are down there, remember? What are you doing this for?
KAFTAN: Move away from that control board. Over here. I shall open the hatch when Klieg gives the signal.
HOPPER: Well why close it in the first place?
KAFTAN: Klieg must remain undisturbed. Your friends will not escape from there, and you will not interfere.
HOPPER: Watch her, Jim. If she moves, blast her.
CALLUM: Right.
HOPPER: Ah, you scream real good, Vic! Thanks a lot.
VICTORIA: Please, the hatch!
HOPPER: Okay, we'll take a risk. Stand by.
VICTORIA: It's very quiet down there.
HOPPER: Yeah, too quiet.
VICTORIA: Something must have happened.
HOPPER: How long they been down there?
VICTORIA: Oh, about an hour.
HOPPER: That's too long. I'm going down. Hey, Jim, what are those bombs loaded with?
CALLUM: Smoke.
HOPPER: Great. Give us a couple, will you?
CALLUM: Yeah, sure.
HOPPER: Come on, come on.
CALLUM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
HOPPER: Okay, here we go.
VICTORIA: I'm coming too.
HOPPER: Later, maybe. Not this trip.
VICTORIA: Who'd be a woman.
HOPPER: How would you know, honey? You'd better stay up here. We don't know what's going on down there.
VICTORIA: Is he always like that?
CALLUM: Most of the time, Vic, yeah.
CONTROLLER: We have decided how you will be used.
KLIEG: Yes?
CONTROLLER: You are a logician. Our race is also logical. You will be the leader of the new race.
KLIEG: You will listen to my proposals then?
CONTROLLER: Yes, we will listen, but first you will be altered.
KLIEG: Altered?
CONTROLLER: You have fear. We will eliminate fear from your brain. Yes. You will be the first.
CYBERMAN: And you will be the next.
PARRY: I? No, no!
CYBERMAN: You will be like us.
CONTROLLER: To die is unnecessary. You will be frozen and placed in our tombs until we are ready to use you. Your lives will be suspended. Prepare the tombs.
PARRY: They really mean it. They're going to freeze us.
JAMIE: Not me.
DOCTOR: No, Jamie. They're coming back.
HOPPER: Come on, you guys, run for it!
 
DOCTOR: Is he all right?
JAMIE: Aye, I think so. Which way is it? I can't remember.
DOCTOR: That way.
JAMIE: Are you sure?
DOCTOR: No, I'm not sure, but try it. I'll be with you in a minute.
JAMIE: All right.
DOCTOR: Captain, we've got to stop them.
HOPPER: Block off this tunnel perhaps?
DOCTOR: No, we can't do that. The hatch. We must get there first. Come on.
CONTROLLER: This humanoid is powerful. We will use him. Prepare him.
HOPPER: Hurry up, can't you? For Pete's sake, get a move on.
JAMIE: I am. I can't breathe. Victoria!
HOPPER: Come on, come on get up!
VICTORIA: Jamie! Look at that smoke.
JAMIE : Victoria!
JAMIE: Come on, Mister Parry. Come on, quick! Stand back.
HOPPER: The Cybermen, they're right behind us.
HOPPER: As soon as the Doctor's up, slam down the hatch!
CALLUM: Okay. Stand by!
DOCTOR: Oh! Ah! He's got my leg!
JAMIE: Doctor, come on! Come on!
DOCTOR: It's no use!
HOPPER: Jim, close the hatch!
JAMIE: Victoria!
CALLUM: Got him!
VICTORIA: It was horrible. It was so strong!
JAMIE: It's all right, Victoria. You're all right now.
PARRY: That was a near thing. Is anyone missing?
HOPPER: Yes. Klieg and Toberman, they're still down there.
CONTROLLER: The humanoid has escaped?
CYBERMAN: Yes.
CONTROLLER: Guard the passageway.
CYBERMAN: Yes.
PARRY: Don't open it. It may be the Cybermen.
DOCTOR: No. No, it's too soft. It must be Toberman and Klieg.
HOPPER: Ah, you're crazy.
PARRY: You're right. We can't leave them down there, even if they are killers.
JAMIE: Oh, they're probably both frozen solid by now.
KAFTAN: You must let them up. They must be saved.
DOCTOR: Yes, they're more dangerous down there than they are up here.
HOPPER: What? Well, okay. Jim.
CALLUM: All right.
HOPPER: Okay, let her go.
DOCTOR: Excuse me, please.
KLIEG: Close it! Close it, quick!
KAFTAN: Eric, where's Toberman?
KLIEG: They've got him.
DOCTOR: Do you still think you can form an alliance with the Cybermen, Mister Klieg?
KLIEG: If I'd only been in a stronger position to bargain with them.
PARRY: You must be out of your mind, Klieg.
HOPPER: You're not in any position to bargain with anybody right now. Well, what are we going to do with him?
PARRY: I'd feel much happier if they weren't left in here.
DOCTOR: Well, what about the testing room? There's only one door. They can't get out.
PARRY: That's a good idea. They'll be quite safe in there.
HOPPER: Callum.
CALLUM: Right. Mister Klieg? Miss Kaftan?
HOPPER: Now, if I don't get back to the rocket, we're not going to take off inside a week.
PARRY: We'll come with you.
HOPPER: I told you before, not till I'm operational again. I'll let you know when that is.
HOPPER: I don't think you'll have any more trouble with your friends down there.
DOCTOR: We shall see.
CONTROLLER: Release the cyber mats. We will use the power of cybernetics.
CONTROLLER: Activate them. The brain of this humanoid will be their target. Now.
CONTROLLER: These Cybermats are dormant through lack of use. Inspect them.
KLIEG: What's that?
KAFTAN: Just me.
KLIEG: Oh, be quiet.
KAFTAN: Sleep later. Look at this.
KLIEG: What is it?
KAFTAN: One of the weapons they were testing. Look, here's the connection.
KLIEG: Let me see. Oh yes, you're right. It's a Cybergun. Take a look at that control. See that everything is switched off.
KAFTAN: Right. All the sequences show negative.
KLIEG: Good. Now they will have to listen.
CYBERMAN: The Cybermats are ready.
CONTROLLER: Stand clear. Now.
KLIEG: Excellent. A small X-Ray laser.
KAFTAN: What are you going to do now?
KLIEG: Take command, of course. What do you think? With this I shall be able to deal with those people in there.
KAFTAN: Never mind about them. The important thing for us is to control the Cybermen.
KLIEG: Yes, I know but
KAFTAN: Isn't it, Eric?
KLIEG: You haven't been down there. You haven't seen those vile things.
KAFTAN: You're not scared, are you?
KLIEG: I have completely underestimated their power.
KAFTAN: But this time we have the power, at least you do. The gun, Eric, the gun. You have the Cybermen's own weapon, this laser to turn against them. Now they will have to obey. If they refuse, we shall destroy the opening device and seal them up in their tomb forever. Now do you understand?
KLIEG: Yes. Yes, you're right. I am invulnerable with this. I shall be master.
KAFTAN: Come, let us deal with these people first. Eric?
KLIEG: Master. The supreme moment in my life. It was logical.
KAFTAN: Eric, we have work to do.
KLIEG: Yes, yes, of course. But hardly work, more a pleasure.
KAFTAN: What?
KLIEG: The pleasure to test this on that Doctor and his companions. The others are of no consequence, but he will make a most precise target.
CONTROLLER: Enough. These humanoids are not like us. They still have fear. Place the Cybermats on the runway.
CONTROLLER: Cybermats will attack.
DOCTOR: I'm on your side, remember? Hey, why didn't you wake me? I should have been on watch half an hour ago.
VICTORIA: I thought you should rest.
DOCTOR: Why me?
VICTORIA: No reason really.
DOCTOR: Oh, I think I know. Is it because I'm
VICTORIA: Well, if you are 450 years old, you need a great deal of sleep.
DOCTOR: Well that's very considerate of you, Victoria, but between you and me, I'm really quite lively actually, all things being considered.
DOCTOR: Are you happy with us, Victoria?
VICTORIA: Yes, I am. At least, I would be if my father were here.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, I know.
VICTORIA: I wonder what he would have thought if he could see me now.
DOCTOR: You miss him very much, don't you?
VICTORIA: It's only when I close my eyes. I can still see him standing there, before those horrible Dalek creatures came to the house. He was a very kind man, I shall never forget him. Never.
DOCTOR: No, of course you won't. But, you know, the memory of him won't always be a sad one.
VICTORIA: I think it will. You can't understand, being so ancient.
DOCTOR: Eh?
VICTORIA: I mean old.
DOCTOR: Oh.
VICTORIA: You probably can't remember your family.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, I can when I want to. And that's the point, really. I have to really want to, to bring them back in front of my eyes. The rest of the time they sleep in my mind, and I forget. And so will you. Oh yes, you will. You'll find there's so much else to think about. So remember, our lives are different to anybody else's. That's the exciting thing. There's nobody in the universe can do what we're doing. You must get some sleep and let this poor old man stay awake.
DOCTOR: Jamie, Victoria, Callum, wake up. Wake up!
JAMIE: What?
VICTORIA: What is it?
DOCTOR: Callum. Callum!
VICTORIA: It's one of those terrible things again.
DOCTOR: Don't move, Callum. Don't move.
DOCTOR: Now get back to the controls, all of you. Steady, don't make any sudden movements. Parry, Parry. Wake up, Parry. Wake up. Wake up. Don't panic. Come back with us. Steady. Now we'll all go in the other room and lock them out.
CALLUM: Let's get out of here. The main doors. No, look.
VICTORIA: Oh Doctor, we're trapped.
DOCTOR: Back against the controls, everybody.
DOCTOR: Here. Five me a hand, quick.
PARRY: What?
DOCTOR: Lay this down on the ground. Come on!
JAMIE: They'll go over it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on!
CALLUM: Let's blast the filthy things!
DOCTOR: You're wasting your time. There are too many of them. Now, do what I say. Come back!
DOCTOR: There you are, you see.
PARRY: What are those creatures?
DOCTOR: Well, they're a form of metallic life. They home on human brainwaves and attack.
VICTORIA: Are they safe now?
DOCTOR: Yes, quite safe now. The power cable generated an electrical field and confused their tiny metal minds. You might almost say that they've had a complete metal breakdown.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry, Jamie.
VICTORIA: What about Klieg and Kaftan? They've probably attacked them as well.
PARRY: The testing room.
DOCTOR: Come on. Now mind your feet.
KLIEG: Most ingenious, Doctor. Now, let's see what you can do against this.
CALLUM: Watch out, Doctor!
Episode Four
KLIEG: Keep back! Your gun.
PARRY: You've killed him, you murderer.
KLIEG: No, he is fortunate, I spared him.
JAMIE: You mean you missed him.
KLIEG: Silence. I could have destroyed him if I wanted to. Shall I kill them now?
KAFTAN: No, no, that will not be necessary. I'm sure the Cybermen will have a good use for them. You will make excellent experimental specimens.
VICTORIA: Oh, let me help him, please.
KLIEG: No tricks.
DOCTOR: You still think you can bargain with the Cybermen?
KLIEG: Certainly. And this time on our terms.
KLIEG: I wish to speak to the Controller. I wish to speak to the Controller!
KLIEG : I wish to speak to the Controller!
CONTROLLER: The humanoids must first be destroyed. You will re-enter cells to conserve energy.
CYBERMAN: He is now prepared.
CONTROLLER: Release him.
KLIEG: They're coming. And now, gentlemen, you will see how I shall use the power of the Cybermen.
DOCTOR: Use maybe, but you'll never control the Cybermen.
KAFTAN: Eric, behind you!
KLIEG: Stop. You know what this can do to you.
KLIEG: That's better. Now you are under my control. We know you must be revitalised or you will perish. If you agree to my terms, I shall let you survive.
CONTROLLER: I will listen.
KAFTAN: Make them release Toberman.
JAMIE: If you think they'll listen to you, you're even dafter than I thought.
KLIEG: Silence. Sit down. First, you release our man.
KAFTAN: Toberman, it is good that you are back. Watch them.
JAMIE: Doctor, he seems er
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie, yes.
KLIEG: Stay where you are! Now, do you agree to accept our plan?
DOCTOR: Plan?
KLIEG: The conquest of the Earth.
PARRY: What? You must be out of your mind.
KLIEG: Silence! Your answer?
CONTROLLER: We accept. We will give you some of our power devices.
KLIEG: Good. I knew an understanding could be reached. I shall let you be revitalised. To survive, it must be now. Come forward. Slowly.
KAFTAN: Eric, be careful.
KLIEG: Leave this to me.
PARRY: You're absolutely crazy to trust them!
KLIEG: Do you think so? Then perhaps you and your colleagues had better join him. Go on, go on!
KLIEG: The girl stays with us!
DOCTOR: No!
KLIEG: Any trouble, she is our hostage.
KLIEG: Close the hatch.
KAFTAN: Go on, close it.
JAMIE: He's too weak to get in.
DOCTOR: Quiet, Jamie.
DOCTOR: You seem to be in trouble.
CONTROLLER: The energy levels are low. We will survive. You will help us. You will help us.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, certainly. Jamie, Professor.
JAMIE: You don't mean to say you're actually going to help them?
PARRY: Surely not? You can't support these creatures.
DOCTOR: I think it best. Come on. Come along.
DOCTOR: That's it. Up and in.
CONTROLLER:  Do you understand the machine?
DOCTOR: Yes. One moment.
JAMIE: Have you taken leave of your senses? Now let's go and help Victoria.
DOCTOR: In a moment, Jamie. Now, are you ready?
CONTROLLER: We will survive. We will sur
DOCTOR: Now then, where would you rather have him, in or out of there?
JAMIE: Oh, I see what you mean.
DOCTOR: Only we must make sure that he stays in there.
VICTORIA: Do you really believe you can bargain with those terrible Cybermen?
KAFTAN: That is our concern, not yours.
VICTORIA: I'm talking to him, not you.
KLIEG: They will have to agree to our plan.
VICTORIA: What about the other weapon?
KLIEG: What other weapon?
VICTORIA: Well, I saw another one like that in that room over there.
KLIEG: Is that true?
KAFTAN: I don't know. We'd better make sure.
KLIEG: No, wait. That means that any one of them in there could
KAFTAN: Yes, you're right, Eric.
KLIEG: Better wait here. If the Cyberman is aroused, we shall be ready for him. Now stay well clear. Take no chances.
PARRY: Keep back, it's smoking.
JAMIE: I told you we shouldn't have touched it.
PARRY: Yes, turn it off. It's out of control.
PARRY: It's taken over.
DOCTOR: I think not. I think there must be some sort of internal timing mechanism. Jamie, I hope you made those ropes secure.
JAMIE: Oh, the King of the beasties himself couldnae get out of that one.
DOCTOR: Good!
DOCTOR: Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots sometime.
CONTROLLER: You will remain still.
KLIEG: Stay here and watch that door. At least now we will have some warning.
CALLUM: What do you two hope to gain from all this?
KLIEG: That does not concern you.
KAFTAN: Oh, they might as well know, Eric. We are going to build a better world.
CALLUM: Better? Well, who for?
KLIEG: I told you to watch that door.
KAFTAN: Toberman!
JAMIE: Victoria!
VICTORIA: What's going on?
CONTROLLER: You have done well.
KAFTAN: Toberman!
CONTROLLER: Silence. He is now under our control. Open the tombs.
KAFTAN: No. You have broken your promise.
CONTROLLER: Cybermen do not promise. Such ideas have no value. Open.
KAFTAN: No.
CONTROLLER: That gun will not harm me.
DOCTOR: Look what they've done. You're not like them. You're a man like us. You must help us! He has killed Kaftan! You must help us.
CONTROLLER: You will report to the surface.
DOCTOR: Jamie, the hatch!
DOCTOR: The gun, Jamie!
 
JAMIE: There's another one, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Are there any more?
JAMIE: No, it's gone quiet. I'll close the hatch.
DOCTOR: No, wait a minute. I'd better go down there.
VICTORIA: Oh, no, no, not again.
DOCTOR: It's the only way to make sure.
JAMIE: Then I'll go with you.
DOCTOR: No, wait. You stay and look after Victoria. I'll take somebody else.
DOCTOR: Toberman, you see what these creatures have done to you? They've tried to make you like them. Do you understand? They've tried to make you their slave. They just want to use you. They are evil. Think of Kaftan.
TOBERMAN: Evil!
DOCTOR: They must be destroyed, do you see? Evil must be destroyed, Now, come!
TOBERMAN: Destroy!
DOCTOR: Come! Come on! Come on!
PARRY: Good luck.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
JAMIE: Doctor, the gun.
DOCTOR: I shan't need that.
JAMIE: He should have taken it.
VICTORIA: Oh, poor Mister Callum. How are you feeling?
CALLUM: I can't move my arm. I can't move it.
DOCTOR: Move quietly. They're all dormant, see.
TOBERMAN: Evil!
DOCTOR: No! Quietly. They're only asleep. They're not frozen yet. Now, you watch them. I have things to do. Now, let me see.
DOCTOR: Yes.
 
KLIEG: The cryostat! You're freezing them!
DOCTOR: Klieg!
DOCTOR: No! No! You'll wake them up!
KLIEG: That is exactly my intention. You still don't understand, do you? Their Controller is dead. Now I shall control them. They'll do what I say. You see, Doctor, yours is the privilege to witness for the first time the union between mass power and my absolute intelligence. Who's that? Come out. Come out or I shall kill this man.
KLIEG: It's you. Over to that wall, all of you. All of you! Now.
DOCTOR: Yes, as you say, such a combination between intelligence and power would make you formidable indeed. Why you'd be commander of the universe with your brilliance! It makes the imagination reel with the possibilities!
KLIEG: Why, Doctor, if I had only known you shared my imagination, you might even have worked for me.
DOCTOR: Perhaps it's not too late?
JAMIE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, don't you see?
DOCTOR: Don't you see what this is going to all mean to all the people who come to serve Klieg the All Powerful? Why, no country, no person would dare to have a single thought that was not your own. Eric Klieg's own conception of the, of the way of life!
KLIEG: Brilliant! Yes, yes, you're right. Master of the world.
DOCTOR: Well now I know you're mad. I just wanted to make sure.
HOPPER: Well, the fuel system's okay. We can blast off any time.
PARRY: All right.
HOPPER: Hey, what gives? Well, where is everybody?
PARRY: Down there. And so are Klieg and the Cybermen.
HOPPER: Well, I hope they know what they're doing. I've been down there once and I don't reckon to go again.
VICTORIA: That's all right, Captain. It's comforting to know that we have your superior strength to call on, should we need it.
KLIEG: And so you have forfeited your right to survival. I shall make an example of you to all who question my intelligence, and the supreme power of the Cybermen.
DOCTOR: You know, I've heard all this before somewhere.
JAMIE: You know your trouble? You talk too much.
KLIEG: Oh, you're stupid. You still think that your puny minds can survive against us? You're decadent, weak. Do you know that? Weak!
DOCTOR: All right. Go ahead, kill us.
KLIEG: No, I have a better idea. Much better idea. I shall leave you to the Cybermen. I'm sure they'll have some use for you. Or parts of you.
DOCTOR: Quick Jamie. These two levers together.
JAMIE: I can't shift this one.
DOCTOR: What? You've got to trip that first.
DOCTOR: Last time they were frozen for five centuries. This time it must be forever.
VICTORIA: Oh, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Here we are, Victoria, safe and sound. Close the hatch.
DOCTOR: There we are. Now then. Now, the best thing about a machine that makes sense, you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.
DOCTOR: There we are. Now I think you'd better all go outside.
PARRY: Why, what are you going to do, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm going to re-electrify the main doors.
PARRY: Yes?
DOCTOR: Only this time I'm going to include the hatch and the control panel.
PARRY: Yes.
DOCTOR: Anyone touching any of them will get a considerable shock. In fact, a fatal one.
PARRY: I see.
DOCTOR: Now, everyone outside. And please take him with you, I shall be glad to see him outside.
VICTORIA: Jamie?
JAMIE: No, I'll stay with the Doctor.
VICTORIA: Oh, all right.
DOCTOR: There we are. That's done. Now, we just have to close the main doors and the circuit is complete.
JAMIE: Oh, thank goodness for that.
JAMIE: Doctor. Doctor!
DOCTOR: Jamie, you go that way, I'll go this way. That way will give us more of a chance. When I say run, run.
DOCTOR: Run!
DOCTOR: Quickly. Wait! Stop!
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: We'll get a shock. We must find something to insulate. I know, that shoring timber over there! Hurry up! Hurry up, he's coming!
JAMIE: Okay, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Quickly! We must keep him inside or else all our work'll be wasted.
JAMIE: I can't hold mine. Come on!
DOCTOR: You must do!
JAMIE: Toberman!
CONTROLLER: We must survive. We must survive.
TOBERMAN: You are evil!
DOCTOR: Toberman, come away!
JAMIE: Careful, you'll get killed, man!
TOBERMAN: They shall never pass Toberman. The door is closed.
PARRY: How terrible. Another life gone.
HOPPER: Come on, Professor. Blast off in nine minutes. Well, anybody coming along for the ride?
VICTORIA: We have our own flying machine.
HOPPER: Flying machine?
VICTORIA: At least it works.
HOPPER: Oh, let's go.
PARRY: Right. Well, goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
PARRY: I'm sorry it had to end
DOCTOR: I know. I know. Goodbye.
JAMIE: Now, that really is the end of the Cybermen, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Jamie. On the other hand, I never like to make predictions. Come along.
