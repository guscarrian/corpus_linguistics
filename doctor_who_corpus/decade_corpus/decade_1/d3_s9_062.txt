The Sea Devils
Episode One
CREWMAN: Mayday. Mayday. SS
CREWMAN : Pevensey Castle. We're being attacked!
BOWMAN: Give your position, please. Give your position.
HART: What is it?
BOWMAN: It's a Mayday, sir. SS Pevensey Castle, they say they're being attacked.
CREWMAN: We're abandoning ship! We're abandoning ship! Our position is
ROBBINS: That's it over there.
DOCTOR: There you are, Jo. That's the Master's permanent residence from now on.
JO: Well, let's hope he's still there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
ROBBINS: I'll be back in a couple of hours to take you over to the mainland.
DOCTOR: Right.
TRENCHARD: Yes?
BARCLAY : Main gate. Two visitors for the prisoner, sir, from UNIT. Passes all in order, sir.
TRENCHARD: Right, send them up.
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose we could always come back later,
TRENCHARD: Oh, yes, of course. You'll be the chappie from UNIT.
JO: My name's Josephine Grant. How do you do? And this is the Doctor.
TRENCHARD: Colonel Trenchard. Delighted to meet you. Pleasant trip?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you.
TRENCHARD: You're late, you know?
JO: Yes, we were held up.
TRENCHARD: Mmm, thought you might have sunk without trace.
JO: Sunk?
TRENCHARD: Happens all the time recently.
DOCTOR: What does?
TRENCHARD: Ships vanishing. Makes you think, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does indeed.
TRENCHARD: Now then, passes?
DOCTOR: Well, look, we've been through all that, actually.
TRENCHARD: We don't take any chances here. Let's see them.
TRENCHARD: Oh. Ah, yes, from UNIT.
DOCTOR: That's right, yes.
TRENCHARD: Yes. Ah, jolly good. Well, you'll be wanting to see the prisoner.
DOCTOR: That was the general idea.
TRENCHARD: He's an interesting chap, you know. You'll enjoy talking to him.
DOCTOR: If ever I get the opportunity. Has he given you any trouble as yet?
TRENCHARD: Not a bit.
JO: You've got to be joking! He must have tried to escape?
TRENCHARD: You've seen our security precautions. Anyway, we're on an island.
DOCTOR: Has he tried to hypnotise any of the guards, by any chance?
TRENCHARD: He couldn't. All our men are completely immune to hypnotism.
JO: How can you be so sure?
TRENCHARD: Prove it to you.  Trenchard here. Send that new man, Wilson, in to see the prisoner. Now then, come over here and take a look into this screen.
DOCTOR: My word, he's putting on weight.
TRENCHARD: Poor chap, he can't get the exercise. Now then, watch.
WILSON: Mister Trenchard sent me, sir, to see if you wanted your book changed.
MASTER: Well, that's very kind of him, but I haven't quite finished yet.
WILSON: Right you are, sir.
MASTER: Just a minute. You're new here, aren't you?
WILSON: Arrived yesterday, sir.
MASTER: Wait. Do you know who I am?
WILSON: You're the prisoner.
MASTER: I am the Master. Come here.
MASTER: I am the Master and you will obey me. You understand? You will obey me.
WILSON: You'll let us know when you've finished with the book, sir?
TRENCHARD: You see?
DOCTOR: Yes, very impressive. Perhaps we could see him now, yes?
TRENCHARD: Certainly. This way. After you, my dear.
TRENCHARD: Visitors for you.
MASTER: Why, Doctor! And Miss Grant! What a very pleasant surprise.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, how are you?
MASTER: Well, as you see, very well. Trying to keep fit.
TRENCHARD: Yes, well, I'll leave you all together. Give the guard a shout when you want to leave.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Colonel.
MASTER: He's quite a decent sort, really. Used to be the Governor of a colony once, so he tells me.
DOCTOR: Very small colony, wasn't it? In fact, I believe they claimed independence soon after he arrived.
JO: He seems to be looking after you very well.
MASTER: Oh, yes, I've got everything I want, except, of course, my freedom.
DOCTOR: You can consider yourself lucky. Quite a few people were in favour of having you executed.
MASTER: My dear Doctor, don't think I'm not grateful. I've had a chance to think about things while I've been in here.
DOCTOR: Have you now?
MASTER: I wish that something like this had happened a long time ago.
JO: Surely you don't like being locked up?
MASTER: No, but, it's given me a chance to reconsider my life.
DOCTOR: Am I to take it that you're a changed man?
MASTER: Is that so very incredible? After all, I do have a great deal of which to repent.
JO: You're telling us.
DOCTOR: In that case, perhaps you'd like to tell me the whereabouts of your Tardis?
MASTER: So that you could use it in order to escape from this planet, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, so that I can make absolutely certain that you can't.
MASTER: No, I'm sorry. That is too much to ask.
DOCTOR: Ask a silly question. Come on, Jo. I think we'd better be going. Is there anything that I can do for you at all?
MASTER: There is one thing. Please come in now and then to have a chat. Oh, Trenchard's a very nice man, but his conversation is somewhat limited.
JO: Goodbye.
MASTER: Goodbye, Miss Grant. And goodbye, Doctor. I sincerely hope we meet again very soon.
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: You felt sorry for him, didn't you. You wanted to come down here and see that was all right.
DOCTOR: Well, he used to be a friend of mine once. A very good friend. In fact, you might almost say we were at school together.
JO: How long's he going to be here?
DOCTOR: Forever, I should think.
TRENCHARD: Ah, ready for off, then? I'd better stamp your passes.
DOCTOR: What, again?
TRENCHARD: Got to be checked in and out, old man. It's the rule. Well, we don't look after him too badly, do we?
DOCTOR: No, indeed. But I advise you to be careful. He's a very dangerous man.
TRENCHARD: Ah, don't worry. I keep my eye on him. There you are, my dear. Come along now then.
JO: Thank you.
TRENCHARD: I'll get one of my chaps to run you down to the quayside.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
TRENCHARD: There we are, then. Fooled them nicely, didn't we?
MASTER: I hope so.
TRENCHARD: What about that hypnotism wheeze, eh? That took them in.
MASTER: Don't underestimate the Doctor. Do you really believe that he came here to see me?
TRENCHARD: Why else?
MASTER: Vanishing ships, of course.
TRENCHARD: Oh, I don't think so. No, he didn't seem particularly interested when I mentioned it.
MASTER: You did what!
TRENCHARD: We were just chatting. No harm done, surely.
MASTER: Let's hope not. By the way, what about those admiralty charts I asked for?
TRENCHARD: They'll be here this afternoon.
MASTER: Ah, splendid. Er, there is one more thing.
TRENCHARD: Yes?
MASTER: I wonder, do you think I could have another television set? For the bedroom.
TRENCHARD: Yes. Yes, I'm sure that's possible.
MASTER: Colour, of course.
TRENCHARD: Of course! Well, if you'll excuse me?
ROBBINS: Ah, it's true. Three ships vanished. Something queer going on for all their trying to hush it up.
DOCTOR: Well, who's trying to hush it up?
ROBBINS: Well, them over at the naval base. The secret research establishment.
DOCTOR: You seem to know a great deal about all this.
ROBBINS: Well, I'm in the lifeboat crew, aren't I? We went out to look for survivors. Only found the one lifeboat, capsized. The bottom was all charred in a sort of pattern.
DOCTOR: Well, where's this boat now?
ROBBINS: Ah, the navy took it. Told us to keep our mouths shut.
DOCTOR: Well, where's this naval base, then?
ROBBINS: Over beyond the headland.
DOCTOR: Right, well, perhaps you'd like to take me there straight away.
ROBBINS: Mister Trenchard paid me to bring you out here and take you back. You want to go over to the naval base, then you make your own arrangements.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, you're probably perfectly right. Look, er, I wonder whether you'd like to go and see what's happening to my young friend? She said she was going to buy some picture postcards.
ROBBINS: I don't mind.
DOCTOR: I'd go myself, only my bad leg's playing me up a bit. The Crimea, you know.
ROBBINS: I see. Crimea?
DOCTOR: Oh, Gallipoli? El Alamein? Does it really matter?
ROBBINS: I reckon not.
HART: And I regret to inform your Lordships that our investigations have failed to reveal any clue as to the cause of the sinkings, full stop. The charred ship's lifeboat will be sent to our laboratory at HMS Vernon Portsmouth for investigation and analysis. Meanwhile, we are keeping careful watch.
BLYTHE: Yes, sir?
HART: Come and look at this. What on Earth?
BLYTHE: Perhaps he's lost, sir.
HART: This place is supposed to be top secret. People treating it like Brighton beach.
HART: Get me the Master at Arms. Captain Hart here. I don't know whether you've noticed but there happens to be a stray civilian chugging into the base! Get on to it, will you?
BLYTHE: Sir, he's making straight for the lifeboat!
M-A-A: Oy! You!
DOCTOR: Good afternoon. I wonder whether I could see your commanding officer?
ROBBINS: Thank you, Miss.
ROBBINS: Look after it for me, won't you?
JO: Don't worry. I'll bring it back just as soon as I've found the Doctor.
TRENCHARD: What are you watching?
MASTER: It seems to be a rather interesting extra-terrestrial life form.
TRENCHARD: Only puppets, you know? For children.
MASTER: Oh.
TRENCHARD: Well, here's the chart you wanted.
MASTER: Oh, good!
MASTER: That's right. Thank you. Now.
MASTER: You know, Trenchard, a man of your efficiency is really wasted in a job like this.
TRENCHARD: Huh, bit of a comedown in a way, I suppose, but
MASTER: Never mind. Once our plan succeeds people will really begin to realise your true worth.
TRENCHARD: Ah. What are you doing?
MASTER: I've just been plotting the sightings of the three sinkings. There, there and there. And it's interesting that right in the middle of them, there's this abandoned sea fort.
TRENCHARD: Not abandoned any more, old chap.
MASTER: Really?
TRENCHARD: Hart's people are going to use it as a sonar testing station. Contractors are working on the place now.
MASTER: Hmm.
HICKMAN: How much to see you?
CLARK: A fiver.
HICKMAN: Right.
CLARK: Full house. Kings on twos.
HICKMAN: Oh, that's marvellous, innit. Just marvellous.
CLARK: Come on, it's not your life savings, it's only a couple of quid. I'll give you a chance to get your own back.
HICKMAN: Ah, forget it.
CLARK: What's the matter with you?
HICKMAN: I don't know. Being stuck out here, I suppose.
CLARK: It's not so bad. Are you sure you don't want another game?
HICKMAN: Do you know, there's something funny about this place.
CLARK: Share the joke.
HICKMAN: Well, the place is deserted, right?
CLARK: So?
HICKMAN: Just the two of us on maintenance?
CLARK: Right.
HICKMAN: Yet I keep getting the feeling I'm being watched.
HART: If you are from UNIT, then where are your credentials?
DOCTOR: I never carry the things. A lot of bureaucratic nonsense. If you wish to see my pass, then ask Miss Grant.
HART: Why didn't you arrange for an official visit through normal channels?
DOCTOR: Well, I just dropped in purely on impulse, old chap. As soon as I heard about that charred lifeboat, I had to see it.
HART: Oh? Why?
DOCTOR: You've inspected the boat yourself?
HART: Well, of course I have.
DOCTOR: Then you must have noticed the linear nature of those scorch marks. Excuse me, my dear. May I?
DOCTOR: Now then, sit down. Now, the marks are a very definite shape, a linear shape like this. Now, how do you account for that?
HART: A freak affect if the ship caught fire.
DOCTOR: Yes, but it didn't catch fire. If it had, the smoke and flames would have been seen, wouldn't they?
HART: All right then, how do you account for them?
DOCTOR: A concentrated beam of heat, applied from underneath the boat whilst it was still in the water.
HART: Deliberately to sink a lifeboat?
DOCTOR: Yes, to make sure there were no survivors. What are these markers here?
HART: Those are the last known positions of the missing vessels so far as we can estimate.
BLYTHE: Captain Hart's office? Yes. Yes, I see. Hold on. There's a young lady here with two UNIT passes. She wants to know if there's anyone here called the Doctor?
CLARK: Come on, you can't lose anything at draughts.
HICKMAN: There's a jinx on this place. Nothing but trouble since we started repairing the foundations.
CLARK: Forget it. It's not your problem. Black or white?
HICKMAN: What's that noise?
CLARK: It's a mermaid. She can't resist us.
HICKMAN: Shut up! There's someone moving about upstairs.
CLARK: It's the wind.
HICKMAN: Fat load of use you are.
CLARK: What are you doing there? Going to send up a distress signal?
HICKMAN: You never know.
 
CLARK: Hickman! Hickman?
CLARK: Hickman, where are you?
HART: Yes, well, these passes appear to be in order. You may go.
DOCTOR: Go? My dear chap, I don't want to go. I want to visit this fort here.
HART: That fort is being converted for use as a testing station. There's nobody there but a couple of maintenance workmen.
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, it is right in the centre of all the trouble, isn't it? Now if some of your naval bods could get me out there, Captain?
HART: Doctor, I have no authority to provide naval vessels for your pleasure jaunts.
DOCTOR: Look, don't you realise how important this is?
HART: I realise only too well. Three ships have been sunk and many lives have been lost. Now, if you don't mind?
JO: Doctor, I think he wants us to go.
HART: I suggest that you take your theories along to your own people at UNIT and put the whole thing on an official level.
DOCTOR: If Horatio Nelson had been in charge of this operation, I hardly think that he would have waited for official instructions.
HART: Yes, a pretty impulsive fellow, if one can believe the history books.
DOCTOR: History books? Captain Hart, Horatio Nelson was a personal friend of mine. Come on, Jo.
HART: Good grief. Poor chap's as mad as a hatter.
JO: How do we get onto the fort?
DOCTOR: Up that ladder. Now hold tight, Jo. We're coming alongside now.
JO: I still say you should have taken Mister Robbin's boat back.
DOCTOR: We will, Jo, we will. And we'll take his motor bicycle back at the same time. Still, now we're here, let's take a look around, shall we?
DOCTOR: Well, somebody's here all right.
JO: But where? Where are they, then?
DOCTOR: This is a big fort, Jo. They must be in some other part of it. Come on, we'll find them.
DOCTOR: There are supposed to be two workmen on this thing. They can't just have vanished.
JO: Well, they have, haven't they? Look, Doctor, it's getting dark. Let's get out of here.
DOCTOR: There's plenty of time.
DOCTOR: It must have been the petrol tank.
JO: But it wouldn't just blow up by itself. Doctor, do you realise we're stranded here! 
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jo. There must be a radio on this fort somewhere. We'll just have to get a message back to shore. Come on.
JO: Look!
DOCTOR: What is it?
DOCTOR: He's dead, poor chap.
JO: Oh, Doctor, let's get out of here, please.
DOCTOR: All right. Let's find that radio first.
JO: Shush, listen.
JO: It's coming towards us!
Episode Two
DOCTOR: Stop! We're friends! Stop!
CLARK: Hickman! He's dead! They killed him! Came from the sea. The sea. A sea devil!
DOCTOR: Come on, Jo, quick. Give me a hand.
JO: It's all right.
DOCTOR: We've got to get him into that cabin.
CLARK: Hickman.
DOCTOR: Come on. All right.
CLARK: Monster.
DOCTOR: Yes.
CLARK: Sea devil.
DOCTOR: Now, easy.
CLARK: Hickman.
CLARK: The sea monster.
DOCTOR: Yeah, come on, don't worry. Get yourself down here.
DOCTOR: That's right. Mind your head. Mind yourself.
JO: That's it.
CLARK: Hickman.
JO: Shush.
DOCTOR: Where's your radio? The radio, where is it?
DOCTOR: Over here?
CLARK: Hickman.
JO: Shush.
CLARK: Ripped it out. They took it away.
DOCTOR: Yes, they certainly did.
CLARK: Devil. Sea monster. Monster.
JO: Yes, yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Now, listen to me Take this swab, Jo. Swab his arm. Now, are there are more transmitters on this fort?
CLARK: No, nothing.
DOCTOR: Any transistor radios, that sort of thing?
CLARK: I think so. The crew's quarters. The crew.
JO: What do you want to do? Listen to Night Ride?
DOCTOR: It is possible to turn a receiver into a transmitter, you know.
JO: It is?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's simply a matter of modulating the signal. You connect the output of your loudspeaker into the input of your low frequency amplifier, then you connect the output of your low frequency amplifier into your oscillator. You use your loudspeaker as a microphone and there you are.
JO: Ah.
DOCTOR: Now, where exactly are these transistor radios?
CLARK: Crew's quarters, down the corridor, next deck.
DOCTOR: All right. Thank you. Now don't worry, this is not going to hurt you. All right? Now you'll soon be all right.
CLARK: Hickman.
DOCTOR: Soon feel better. Look after him, will you, Jo?
JO: Yes. Shush. Come on now, try and relax. Come on. That's it.
DOCTOR: Don't be alarmed. I've no wish to harm you.
DOCTOR: Now, wait. We must talk.
JO: How do you feel now? Would you like a nice hot cup of tea with some sugar, hmm?
JO: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: Wire?
JO: What is going on?
DOCTOR: Just as I thought. Reptiles, like those creatures in the caves. It's completely hostile. Here, hang on to this. Tight! Hang on.
JO: Right.
JO: Well, now what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Those creatures can cut through anything. Rock, metal, anything.
JO: Look!
DOCTOR: Come on. Give me a hand.
JO: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: We've got to get after that creature. Now, come on.
BLYTHE: Keep trying.
HART: Morning, Blythe.
BLYTHE: Good morning, sir.
HART: Anything in?
BLYTHE: We've had this report from the civilian police, sir. That man who was here yesterday trying to get over to the fort, seems to have disappeared with the boat he came in.
HART: Oh, no.
BLYTHE: He and the girl were seen heading out to sea yesterday afternoon. There's been no sign of them since.
HART: Well, get onto the fort and see if they've wound up there.
BLYTHE: I've already done that, sir. The fort just wasn't answering. I can't raise them at all.
HART: Well, we'd better take a look around. Get me Air Sea Rescue.
JO: How's it going?
DOCTOR: Nearly finished. Just about to test it.
JO: Hmm, I've seen things like that in a modern art exhibition. You don't honestly think you can transmit with it, do you?
DOCTOR: Certainly I do. I'll prove it to you. Right, here goes.
D J  : Hey there, early birds, we've got a wonderful batch of discs for you this morning! So, don't feel isolated and cut off from the world. Whoever you are, wherever you are, we've got something just for you!
JO: Hey, that was my favourite DJ.
DOCTOR: I think I must have got me wires crossed somewhere.
JO: Here's your tea.
DOCTOR: Thanks.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: Those things that attacked us. You said you'd seen something like it before.
DOCTOR: Something very similar, certainly. They emerged from some caves in Derbyshire.
JO: The Silurians, wasn't it? The Brigadier was telling me.
DOCTOR: That's a complete misnomer. The chap who discovered them must have got the period wrong. No, properly speaking, they should have been called the Eocenes.
JO: That was that race of super reptiles that had been in hibernation for billions of years, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: That's right, and if you want my opinion, there's another of their colony right here beneath us.
JO: Well, something seems to have woken them up.
DOCTOR: Probably the rebuilding of this fort.
JO: But I thought you said they lived in caves?
DOCTOR: Well, this is a different species, completely adapted to life underwater.
JO: And they've been sinking this ships?
DOCTOR: Very likely.
JO: Why? I mean, why are they so hostile? What have we done to them?
DOCTOR: They still think of Earth as their planet, Jo, and they want it back. As far as they're concerned, man is just an ape who got above himself. Right, I think that should do it. Let's have another go. Hello, hello. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday! This is, er, this, er, this is. What is this? What's our call sign?
JO: Oscar Bravo Tango Seven Four.
DOCTOR: Hello, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, this is Oscar Bravo Tango Seven Four. We are stranded on this fort and have a wounded man here. Can you send immediate assistance? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Over.
JO: Oh Doctor, you don't think you'll get through to anybody on that old lash-up, do you?
PILOT : Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango, am receiving you loud and clear. Am about to land. Over.
JO: It works!
DOCTOR: Hello, Oscar Bravo Tango speaking. Who are you? Who are you? Over.
JO: It's a helicopter!
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, though I say so myself, I think that's a remarkably efficient piece of work.
TRENCHARD: Right, put it over there. Here we are then.
MASTER: Splendid!
TRENCHARD: None too easy, you know, getting hold of something like this at a moments notice. Had to send one of my chaps to the mainland. Said it was for theatricals.
MASTER: How very ingenious.
TRENCHARD: Nothing to it. Just have to use the old loaf, you know. When do we leave?
MASTER: As soon as possible.
HART: How can I go to the Admiralty with a story like that? Sea Devils. If only you had some proof.
JO: What about the two men on the fort? One of them was killed but the other one saw the creature.
HART: Yes. Get on to sickbay, will you? See if he's conscious yet.
BLYTHE: Sickbay, please. Oh hello, Captain Hart's secretary
DOCTOR: Even you must admit that something happened on that fort!
HART: Well, perhaps one of them went berserk and attacked the other one.
JO: But we saw it too, remember?
HART: You may. Well, Blythe?
BLYTHE: He's still delirious and he's babbling something about sea devils.
TRENCHARD: You can go to the Petty Officer's mess. I'll send for you later.
GUARD: Very good, sir.
CPO: Squad, eyes right!
CPO: Eyes front! About turn! Squad, halt!
HART:  Well, did he say why he wanted to see me? Oh, all right, you'd better send him up. All right then, Doctor, let's assume that I accept the existence of these Sea Devils. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Well, to begin with, we must make every effort to make contact with them.
HART: But you claim that they're responsible for sinking the ships.
DOCTOR: It may still be possible to find a peaceful solution. We're not dealing with animals, Captain Hart, we're dealing with intelligent beings.
TRENCHARD: Have you got a minute, old chap? Ah, thanks very much. Want a word with you about the golf tournament. Good heavens!
DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard.
TRENCHARD: Doctor. Miss Grant. Thought you two'd left the island yesterday.
JO: Well, we didn't quite manage to get away.
TRENCHARD: Taking a look round the island? Charming spot, isn't it?
TRENCHARD: Er, sorry to bother you, John, old man, but it's about the weekend. We are rather relying on you, you know.
HART: Of course I'll do my best, but if we get a bit of a flap on, then
TRENCHARD: That's just what I was thinking, so perhaps it would be as well if I arranged to have a reserve standing by.
DOCTOR: Yes, why don't you do that, Colonel? Captain Hart is likely to be very busy from now on.
HART: Yes, life is rather full at the moment, George.
TRENCHARD: Exactly! So as I was passing, I just thought, old John's going to pretty tied up with all these ship's sinking. Is it fair to ask him to play golf in the middle of something like this? So I said to myself, What I'll do is I'll just drop by and sound him out. You see, time's getting short and I've got to get cracking.
SMEDLEY: I'm sorry, sir, but should I know you?
MASTER: You certainly should, Chief. Had you not been warned of my coming?
SMEDLEY: No, I'm afraid not, sir.
MASTER: Special audit, Ministry of Defence.
SMEDLEY: Special audit, sir?
MASTER: Yes, the items in this bag here are defective. Did you realise that you were carrying defective supplies here, Chief?
SMEDLEY: Look, I'm sorry, sir, but do you mind if I see your pass, please?
MASTER: Captain Hart's preparing it right now. He'll be bringing it down right away.
SMEDLEY: I see, sir. Well then, you won't mind if I just phone and double check then, will you.
MASTER: What exactly are you suggesting?
SMEDLEY: I'm not suggesting anything, sir. I'm just obeying orders.
MASTER: You will obey my order, Chief Petty Officer!
SMEDLEY: Your order, sir?
MASTER: You will obey me. You have seen my pass and it is quite correct.
SMEDLEY: Your pass.
MASTER: You have seen my pass.
SMEDLEY: No, I've got to phone and check.
HART: Now, don't worry, George. If I can't make the tournament, I'll let you know in plenty of time.
TRENCHARD: Yes, but you do understand I don't want you to feel under any pressure about this. If you want to drop out, I suppose I could rope in old Harry.
HART: Well, perhaps that's for the best. Now, if you don't mind, George?
TRENCHARD: At the same time, I don't want you to miss your game. I mean ,we we'd much rather have you if you can manage it.
HART: Well, I'll do my best. Now goodbye, George.
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course. I see how busy you are.
HART: Yes.
TRENCHARD: Staying down here much longer, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It entirely depends how long it takes me to conclude my business. Good day, Colonel.
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course, I mustn't hold you up. Goodbye, Miss Grant. It's been a great pleasure to see you again.
JO: Goodbye, Colonel.
TRENCHARD: Well, I'll, er, I'll be pushing off then. Oh, thanks very much.
HART: I'll be in touch, George.
TRENCHARD: Yes.
HART: Now then, Doctor, where were we?
DOCTOR: Where were we indeed? Ships must be kept away from this area.
HART: Doctor, those are major shipping lanes. We'd have protests from all over the world.
DOCTOR: You'll have even bigger protests if ships go on sinking.
HART: And even if we do declare it a prohibited area, how are we going to enforce it?
HART: You know what happens in the English Channel. Trinity House marker buoys are ignored half the time.
DOCTOR: You'll just have to patrol the area, won't you?
HART: What are we supposed to do? 
DOCTOR: You don't seem to realise how dangerous
JO: Doctor!
DOCTOR: What?
JO: Doctor, come here!
DOCTOR: Jo, please, not now.
HART: Don't you believe it.
JO: Doctor, it's the Master!
DOCTOR: What? Where?
JO: Down
JO: But it was him. Look, I know it was.
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, I suggest that you order a full security alert immediately.
HART: Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
DOCTOR: Miss Grant has just seen a very dangerous criminal on your base.
HART: Doctor, I've been very patient with you, but if I thought
BLYTHE: Sir, someone's been found unconscious in the sonar stores.
DOCTOR: Come on.
SMEDLEY: I don't know. He was taking equipment, sir. Said he was doing some special audit. Well, I went to phone up to check and that's when he hit me.
DOCTOR: What did this officer look like?
SMEDLEY: About my height. He was dark and he had a short beard.
JO: You see? The Master.
HART: Who is the Master?
JO: How did he get in here? He's supposed to be locked up.
DOCTOR: Trenchard.
JO: What?
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? He arrived just before this happened and he left a few moments ago.
JO: Of course. All that silly talk about a golf tournament.
HART: Are you suggesting that George Trenchard is mixed up in all this?
DOCTOR: Yes, I certainly am. Captain Hart, can you lend me some transport?
HART: Well, of course I can, but what's it all about?
DOCTOR: No time to explain now. Come on, Jo.
TRENCHARD: In conference.
DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard.
TRENCHARD: Hello, old chap. What are you doing here?
DOCTOR: I've reason to believe that your prisoner has escaped.
TRENCHARD: Nonsense!
DOCTOR: It is?
TRENCHARD: See for yourself.
TRENCHARD: There you are, you see? Safe and sound.
JO: Well he may be here now, but half an hour ago he was at the naval base.
TRENCHARD: Impossible. Must be a case of mistaken identity.
TRENCHARD: I'll tell you what, though. I'll go and check the guards myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do that.
TRENCHARD: Yes.
JO: All clear.
DOCTOR: Try and get an outside line. No, they're both completely dead. Now listen, Jo. I want you to take the jeep, go down to the naval base and call UNIT. Tell them that Colonel Trenchard and his entire staff are to replaced immediately.
JO: But, Doctor
DOCTOR: No buts, Jo. Just do as I ask.
JO: What about you?
DOCTOR: Now, don't worry about me. I'll stay here and keep an eye on him. Now, you hurry.
TRENCHARD: But the girl saw you!
MASTER: Oh, it could only have been a fleeting glimpse. Convince her that she was mistaken.
TRENCHARD: I tell you, they don't believe me. The Doctor knows.
MASTER: Very well. In that case, suggest to the Doctor that he come down here and see me for himself.
TRENCHARD: What's the good of that?
MASTER: I'll tell him exactly what we're doing. I'll convince him to keep quiet.
TRENCHARD: Could you?
MASTER: Yes, yes. But I must see him alone. I don't want any guards. You leave everything to me. I'll put the Doctor's mind at rest.
TRENCHARD: All right. I suppose it's worth a try.
MASTER: Ah, I think there's something wrong with the air conditioning in here. Now, that grille seems to be blocked.
TRENCHARD: I've seen the guards. Everything's in perfect order.
DOCTOR: Fore!
TRENCHARD: Bless my soul!
DOCTOR: You were saying, Colonel?
TRENCHARD: Er, where's Miss Grant?
DOCTOR: Oh, she's gone back to the naval base.
TRENCHARD: Oh, I see. Look here, old chap, if you're worried, I suggest you go and see the prisoner yourself.
DOCTOR: Oh, I've just seen him.
TRENCHARD: What?
DOCTOR: Yes, on there.
TRENCHARD: Oh! Yes, quite, but if you're in any doubt, I'd sooner you interrogated the man yourself. You know the way, don't you?
DOCTOR: If you insist.
TRENCHARD: Trenchard here. There is a Miss Grant on her way down to you. She is not to leave.
MASTER: Why, Doctor, so you came for a chat.
DOCTOR: Been out for a little jaunt, have you?
MASTER: I beg your pardon?
DOCTOR: Why did you go to the naval stores and steal those electronic spares?
MASTER: How could I possibly go anywhere? You know very well that I'm a prisoner.
DOCTOR: You've got some sort of hold over Colonel Trenchard. What's going on?
MASTER: I can see that I shall have to tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Good afternoon!
DOCTOR: Akidai!
DOCTOR: Like that is it?
DOCTOR: I wouldn't do that if I were you. That's government property.
DOCTOR: I always find that violent exercise makes me hungry. Don't you agree?
MASTER: Then you'd better enjoy your meal, Doctor, because it might be your last.
DOCTOR: Oh, you think so?
MASTER: You're good, Doctor, but you're not good enough.
DOCTOR: Ah, but you haven't seen the quality of my footwork yet!
DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut. How many times have I told you? Violence will never get you anywhere.
Episode Three
TRENCHARD: What's going on here?
MASTER: I was defending myself. This man came here to kill me.
TRENCHARD: Be so good as to explain yourself, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Only a complete fool would listen to such an accusation. Though I suppose in your case.
TRENCHARD: Don't speak to me like that. I shall have a full enquiry into the whole thing. Meanwhile, consider yourself under arrest. Take him to my office immediately.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't be absurd, man.
TRENCHARD: You heard me. Take him away. 
DOCTOR: If you must continue with this ridiculous charade. Only take care not to lose him this time, won't you?
TRENCHARD: What are you going to do, kill him? I warn you
MASTER: I told you. I was defending myself. The point is, what are you going to do about it?
TRENCHARD: This whole thing's getting out of hand. I just don't know.
MASTER: Well then, I'll tell you. Keep the Doctor here a prisoner. You have no alternative. By the way, is the girl with him?
TRENCHARD: Yes. She was going to leave, but I had her stopped at the main entrance.
MASTER: Good. Then there's nothing to worry about.
JO: The keys! I've got to get back to the naval base. It's urgent!
BARCLAY: Sorry, Miss. Orders. Take her back inside.
BARCLAY: Well, don't just sit there. Get after her!
DOCTOR: Have you any idea why Colonel Trenchard is taking orders from the Master? Look, man, I'm talking to you.
DOCTOR: Very well.
TRENCHARD: Now then, Doctor, I'm afraid you're in very serious trouble. I've been giving this matter some thought. I'm going to hold you here until the whole thing's cleared up.
DOCTOR: Is that what the Master told you to say?
TRENCHARD: You've attacked a government employee, and tried to harm a prisoner under my care and protection.
DOCTOR: I've done no such thing. The Master knocked that guard out himself, as you very well know.
TRENCHARD: And as for this UNIT pass of yours, I believe it's a forgery.
DOCTOR: That's absolute rubbish. Anybody at UNIT headquarters will vouch for me, if you'll permit me to use the telephone.
TRENCHARD: Prisoners are not allowed to make telephone calls.
DOCTOR: Colonel Trenchard, why are you allowing the Master to use you like this?
TRENCHARD: All right, take him away.
DOCTOR: Look, you're jeopardising your entire career.
TRENCHARD: I have nothing further to say to you. The interview is over.
DOCTOR: Didn't anybody else warn you about the Master? Whatever he's told you, it's all lies.
TRENCHARD: You'll be well treated as long as you behave yourself.
DOCTOR: You really think you can keep me here?
TRENCHARD: This is no ordinary prison. If you attempt to escape, the guards will shoot to kill.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you. Thank you very much.
TRENCHARD: Trenchard. What? Then find her. Now!
TRENCHARD: I've got him under lock and key.
MASTER: Just a minute. Under lock and key, eh?
TRENCHARD: Yes.
MASTER: The girl, too?
TRENCHARD: What a fascinating contraption.
MASTER: I asked about the girl.
TRENCHARD: Oh, little mishap on the way back here. She got away.
MASTER: And by now is, no doubt, running straight back to the naval base.
TRENCHARD: Oh, no fear of that. She'll never get out of the grounds. Guards'll pick her up at any moment.
MASTER: I hope that you're right.
TRENCHARD: Oh, no doubt about it.
MASTER: Nevertheless, we need to work very fast from now on. Trenchard, I need your fullest cooperation. Tell me, where is the Doctor?
TRENCHARD: In a security cell.
MASTER: Send him to me, will you? I want a word with him.
HART: I can't give you much to go on, I'm afraid, but I believe there's something down there. Your submarine's fitted with the new experimental sonar. It'll give you a chance to try it out.
RIDGEWAY: What are we looking for, sir?
HART: I wish I knew. The man we took off the fort was babbling something about sea devils.
RIDGEWAY: Oh, don't you think this is getting a bit out of hand, sir? Ships have vanished at sea before.
HART: I'm well aware of that. To be exact, seventy in the last ten years. But we've lost three all in the same area in the last few weeks.
RIDGEWAY: We'll do what we can to find your sea devils, sir.
HART: I want you to signal me a full report the moment you resurface.
RIDGEWAY: Yes, sir.
HART: All right, carry on.
RIDGEWAY: Thank you, sir.
HART: And good luck.
RIDGEWAY: Thank you, sir.
BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir?
HART: Yes?
BLYTHE: I was just wondering about Miss Grant and the Doctor. Shouldn't they be back by now?
TRENCHARD: All right, Doctor. Come along in.
MASTER: Ah, Doctor. Good of you to spare me a few moments.
DOCTOR: I hadn't really anything better to do.
MASTER: Yes, time does hang heavy when one is a prisoner. Would you care to sit down?
DOCTOR: Thank you.
TRENCHARD: Right.
DOCTOR: How very kind of you.
DOCTOR: How very unkind of you.
TRENCHARD: Right, I'll leave you to have your little chat. There will be a guard outside at all times.
DOCTOR: I'm very relieved to hear it.
MASTER: No doubt, Doctor, you're wondering why I sent for you?
DOCTOR: Your usual childish desire to gloat, perhaps?
MASTER: How much have you told UNIT?
DOCTOR: Everything. I sent them a full report as soon as Miss Grant spotted you at the naval base.
MASTER: And yet you came back here to investigate in person. Interesting. You know, I wonder whether you're telling me the truth.
DOCTOR: Well, you'll find out soon enough.
MASTER: You realise, of course, that I could kill you here and now?
DOCTOR: And how would you explain that away to Colonel Trenchard? I'm hardly in a position to attack you, now am I?
MASTER: Do you really think I care what Trenchard thinks?
DOCTOR: Whatever you're up to, you still need Trenchard's cooperation. You're still a prisoner here, you know.
MASTER: My dear Doctor, I can walk out of here any time I choose.
DOCTOR: Then why don't you?
MASTER: Because this place makes a good base for my operations. You see, I'm planning to contact our reptilian friends.
DOCTOR: How do you know about them?
MASTER: Oh, from the Time Lord's files.
DOCTOR: More stolen information?
MASTER: Naturally.
DOCTOR: Well, why do you want to contact them?
MASTER: Those reptiles, Doctor, were once the rulers of this Earth. And with my help, they can be so again.
RIDGEWAY : Entering the specified zone now, sir. About to dive.
HART: Very well. Standing by for your report. Carry on.
BOWMAN: Sir.
BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir.
HART: Yes, what is it?
BLYTHE: I hope you don't mind, but I telephoned Colonel Trenchard about the UNIT people. He said they'd both gone back to London.
HART: Oh, I see.
BLYTHE: But they didn't bring the Land Rover back, sir. Colonel Trenchard said they took a taxi to the quay.
HART: Well, you'd better send someone to collect it.
BLYTHE: Yes, sir, but why take a taxi when they could have used the Land Rover, and, well
HART: Well, go on.
BLYTHE: Well, sir, surely they'd have come back here before leaving the island?
RIDGEWAY: Keep fifty feet.
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.  Stand by to blow Q.
RATING : Stand by to blow Q.
MITCHELL: Blow Q.
RATING : Blow Q.
RIDGEWAY: Up periscope. Right, Number One, stand by to start your sonar watch.
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir. Er, what are we looking for, sir?
RIDGEWAY: I don't know. Maybe we'll know when we find it.
MITCHELL: Sir.
DOCTOR: I still don't see why you want to help them. What can you possibly gain?
MASTER: The pleasure of seeing the human race exterminated, Doctor. The human race of which you are so fond. Believe me, that'll be a reward in itself.
DREW: The governor wants to see you, sir.
MASTER: In a moment.
DREW: He wants to see you now, sir.
DOCTOR: Better run along, old chap. You're still a prisoner here, you know.
DOCTOR: You'll never get it off the ground.
TRENCHARD: Captain Hart's car has been spotted heading for the main gate. He must have guessed something's up. What am I to do?
MASTER: Use your intelligence, Trenchard. Bluff him.
DOCTOR: Anyone out there?
DOCTOR : I said, is there anyone out there?
DREW: Please be quiet, sir.
DOCTOR : Look, guard, I want to talk to you. I said I want to talk to you!
DREW: What's all the noise about, sir?
DOCTOR: How much longer am I going to be kept chained up like this?
DOCTOR : What about the Geneva convention?
DREW : You'll have to stay here till someone tells me different, sir.
DOCTOR : What about some food, then? I'm sure they didn't tell you to starve me to death.
DREW : You'll be fed when the time comes.
DOCTOR: You tell Colonel Trenchard that I want to see him straight away. He's got no right to keep me here like this.
DREW: Look, sir, you're a lot better off here than in one of the cells, so please be quiet, sir.
DOCTOR:  You'll find tools over there.
TRENCHARD: There's nothing more I can tell you, old chap. I'm as puzzled as you are. Just called for a taxi and off they went.
HART: I see. But Miss Grant was sure she'd caught sight of your prisoner at the base.
TRENCHARD: Absolutely ridiculous! This place is totally secure. Oh, just take a look at the alarm system. There.
HART: And you see, George, you did drop in on me at exactly the time of the robbery.
TRENCHARD: My dear chap, you're scarcely suggesting that I pinched your wretched material? Don't understand the stuff. Tried to make myself a crystal set once when I was a lad. Never got it to work.
HART: Well then, would it be possible to see your prisoner?
TRENCHARD: Oh, strictly against the rules. No one can see him without a special pass. Completely incommunicado.
HART: Oh, surely we can stretch the rules, George? This is important.
TRENCHARD: Well, all right, old chap, seeing it's you. Take a look at him on this.
HART: Thank you.
TRENCHARD: There you are.
HART: Well, I suppose the Doctor must have been wrong.
TRENCHARD: Of course he was. Seemed a pretty cranky sort of fellow to me.
HART: Er
TRENCHARD: Time for a quick one?
HART: No. I should be going, George.
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, of course. I realise how busy you are.
HART: Well, thank you. Look here, George, I
TRENCHARD: The guard will see you out.
HART: Yes, thank you.
TRENCHARD: Bye, John.
RIDGEWAY: Anything, Number One?
MITCHELL: Er, no, sir. Nothing. Nothing at all.
RIDGEWAY: Well, keep trying, old chap.
MITCHELL: Sir.
MITCHELL: Er, we have a contact, sir.
RIDGEWAY: What the blazes is that?
LOVELL: It's gone crazy, sir.
RIDGEWAY: Get on to the sonar maintenance.
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.
LOVELL: It's packed up, sir.
MITCHELL: It's gone dead, sir!
RIDGEWAY: What the devil's going on?
ENGINEER : Manoeuvring room here, sir. Loss of essential power supplies.
MAN : Reporting loss of essential power supplies.
MAN 2 : Loss of essential supplies.
MAN 3 : I repeat, no essential power supplies.
MASTER: Well, Trenchard. I think that you handled Captain Hart exceedingly well.
TRENCHARD: I can't keep it up, you know. The lies I've told. How long before that device of yours is ready?
MASTER: Oh, just a few hours now.
TRENCHARD: What is exactly is it?
MASTER: It's a perfect replica of the communications device used by the enemy agents. We are going to use it to lure them into a trap.
TRENCHARD: I only hope it works. If it doesn't, I'm for it, you know?
MASTER: Oh, it'll work. Don't you worry about that. Just think of it, Trenchard. You will be responsible for exposing some of the most dangerous saboteurs this country has ever known. I think you'll find that a grateful government will give you anything that you ask for.
TRENCHARD: Oh, don't want any reward, of course. Just doing my duty.
MASTER: Yes, of course. I'd better get back to my quarters.
TRENCHARD: This Doctor fellow, have you finished with him?
MASTER: For the time being, yes. Oh, by the way, what about the girl? Have they caught her yet?
TRENCHARD: Oh, grounds are very large, you know. Only a matter of time, though. She can't get away.
MASTER: I hope you're right. Er, it might be better if one of the guards were to take me back.
TRENCHARD: Huh? Oh, yes, of course! Er, must keep up appearances, what? Guard?
DOCTOR:  Behind the door.
DOCTOR: Guard! Guard. Guard! I want to talk to you!
DREW: What's wrong now, sir?
DOCTOR: These handcuffs. They're far too tight. They're killing me.
DREW: I'm under strict instructions, sir, that they're to be kept on
DOCTOR: After you.
JO: No, after you.
DOCTOR: No, no. After you.
HART: Anything from the sub?
BLYTHE: No sir.
HART: Look here, Blythe, you'd better get on to UNIT and see if they've any news yet of the Doctor and Miss Grant's return.
BLYTHE: Right, sir.
TRENCHARD: What's happened?
MASTER: It would appear that Miss Grant has succeeded in releasing the Doctor.
TRENCHARD: This is appalling! It'll ruin everything!
MASTER: Exactly. That's why you've got to find them!
MITCHELL: It's no good, sir. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the engines. We've run a complete check on them.
RIDGEWAY: And we're still going down.
MITCHELL: What do we do now, sir?
RIDGEWAY: Keep working on the engines.
MITCHELL: There's nothing wrong with them, sir. There's nothing wrong with any part of this boat. We've checked everything.
RIDGEWAY: Then check again.
MITCHELL: Divers?
RIDGEWAY: That's impossible.
MITCHELL: There's something out there, sir.
RATING : Forward section here, sir. We're being attacked.
RIDGEWAY: This is the captain. what's happening?
RATING : Someone's coming in, sir, through the escape compartment.
RIDGEWAY: Shut off forward and aft escape compartments.
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.
RIDGEWAY: What's happening, man?
RATING : They're coming in, sir! They're Aargh!
TRENCHARD:  Understand this. They've got to be found. They're two dangerous enemy agents. Use every available man.
BARCLAY: Ground to control. Subjects entering sector twenty seven.
TRENCHARD: Yes, yes, all right.
TRENCHARD: They're making for the beach, towards the minefield.
MASTER: No doubt they're trying to rejoin their associates at sea.
TRENCHARD: Right. We must head them off.
MASTER: No. Let them get to the beach.
TRENCHARD: But we've got to catch them.
MASTER: We shall. This device is now ready for testing. We shall use it trap them all together.
DOCTOR: Come on, Jo! Come on!
JO: Doctor, look!
Episode Four
TRENCHARD: What is it?
MASTER: One of the creatures that have been destroying the ships.
TRENCHARD: You told me it was enemy agents. Why didn't you tell me the truth?
MASTER: If I had, would you have believed me?
DOCTOR: There's only one thing for it. We'll have to go through the minefield.
JO: We'll get blown up.
DOCTOR: No, don't worry.
JO: What are you doing?
DOCTOR: My sonic screwdriver. It converts into rather a good mine detector.
DOCTOR: Look out. Look, there's one over there. Now, you'll have to move round to the right. Now follow me.
MASTER: Stupid beast. Why doesn't it attack them?
JO: Doctor, it's following us!
JO: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Relax, Jo, relax.
DOCTOR: Right, follow me.
HART: Anything from the sub yet?
BOWMAN: It's no good, sir, there's nothing.
HART: They had instructions to surface over an hour ago.
BLYTHE: Maybe they've found something, sir. Perhaps they're still investigating.
HART: If they haven't surfaced by now, then something must be stopping them. All right, submiss procedure. Alert submarine command. We'll set up a full scale search right away.
BLYTHE: Sir.
RATING : Submarine indicator buoys still won't release, sir.
RIDGEWAY: All right, Summers. Radio Captain Hart the moment you surface. Tell him we're immobilised on the sea bed by some unknown force and intruders have broken through the hull.
SUMMERS: Aye, aye, sir.
RIDGEWAY: You've checked your R/T?
SUMMERS: Yes, sir.
RIDGEWAY: All right, carry on. Good luck.
MITCHELL: Something's happening to this door, sir. It's getting hot.
RIDGEWAY: Right, small arms, Number One.
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.
SUMMERS: Forward hatch is jammed, sir.
RIDGEWAY: All right, Summers.
RIDGEWAY: Johnson, here. Petty Officer, here.
RIDGEWAY: Right, take cover.
MITCHELL: The door's going!
RIDGEWAY: All right, Number One. Hold your fire until we see what they are.
TRENCHARD: I just can't take it in. It's all too much for me.
MASTER: Trenchard, you really must be more calm. Believe me, it's very simple.
TRENCHARD: Simple? You've misled me all along. You said it was spies, saboteurs. You said we'd catch them.
MASTER: Look, if I had talked to you about sea monsters, would you have believed me?
TRENCHARD: I've risked everything to help you and you've lied to me.
MASTER: I had to lie. Now sit down, Trenchard. Sit down and listen to me.
TRENCHARD: I don't know how you can be so calm.
MASTER: Now listen, that creature that you saw is one of a race of intelligent reptiles that has a deadly hatred of mankind. Now somehow, they've established themselves in the sea, but now they intend to emerge and conquer the Earth.
TRENCHARD: What? We must warn the authorities at once!
MASTER: No, no. Premature action would ruin everything.
TRENCHARD: What else can we do?
MASTER: Wait until this device of mine is perfected, and then tell the authorities.
DOCTOR: Hold still. Hold still.
DOCTOR: Right. We've got to get back to Captain Hart. Come on.
TRENCHARD: They're not in the beach sector. We've completely lost track of them.
MASTER: Trenchard, if they reach the naval base
TRENCHARD: Exactly. They'll tell Hart everything.
MASTER: Mind you, there's a good chance that he won't believe them, of course.
TRENCHARD: But suppose he does? Suppose he turns up here again?
MASTER: Refuse to admit him.
TRENCHARD: Don't be ridiculous!
MASTER: Trenchard, you are running a top security establishment here. Your only responsibility is to the government.
TRENCHARD: What about the Doctor? He'll report to UNIT. They can go to the government.
MASTER: Now look, you must trust me a little longer. I assure you all your troubles will soon be over.
RATING : Aft end flange space dry of water, sir.
MITCHELL: Why there?
RIDGEWAY: Ask Green Gilbert.
MITCHELL: All right, old man. Get you there in no time! Er, sir, shall we take a look at the pressure gauge, sir?
RIDGEWAY: If you'll excuse me one moment?
MITCHELL: Sir, shouldn't we try and jump them?
RIDGEWAY: No.
MITCHELL: You mean we're going to do nothing at all?
RIDGEWAY: Sooner or later, these things are going to return to their base. I want to know where that is. Starboard twenty, Number One.
HART: I'm sorry if I seem to be repeating myself, Doctor, but I don't believe a word of it!
DOCTOR: Well, I can assure you we didn't walk ten miles across open countryside just to tell you fairy stories.
HART: Monsters coming out of the sea.
JO: But it's different this time. Everybody saw it. Even Trenchard and the guards.
HART: And you think Trenchard will confirm your story?
DOCTOR: I doubt it. The Master's got some sort of hold over him.
JO: The Doctor's seen these creatures before.
HART: Oh, I'm quite sure he has, Miss Grant.
JO: In some caves in Derbyshire. You see, they want to take over the Earth
HART: Oh, really, Miss Grant, if you think for one moment I'm going to believe
JO: Well, re-take if you like, and what they're going to do is
DOCTOR: All right, Jo, all right, all right. Let me deal with the explanations. Look, it's like this
BLYTHE: Only cheese, I'm afraid. The best the steward could do.
JO: Oh, that's super. Thanks very much.
DOCTOR: For heaven's sakes, Jo. What do you think this is, a picnic?
DOCTOR: All right, well let's forget about the Sea Devils. What about Trenchard trying to take us prisoners then?
HART: Well, I only have your word for that, haven't I?
DOCTOR: All right, what about the theft of your electronic spares? Surely you'll agree that happened?
HART: Since I was here at the time, yes.
JO: The Master stole those parts to make his calling device, and
HART: His what?
DOCTOR: Well, he's developed some way of communicating with them. Probably a ultra-high frequency sonic beam. These are rather good. Want one?
HART: No, thank you.
DOCTOR: Sandwich?
BLYTHE: Thank you.
JO: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry.
BLYTHE: Captain Hart's office? Oh, I see. Yes, yes, I'll tell him. They've had to abandon the search, sir. They'll start again at first light.
HART: Very well.
BLYTHE: I'll get you some more sandwiches.
JO: Thanks very much.
DOCTOR: How overdue is the submarine?
HART: Four hours.
DOCTOR: It should never have been sent, you know. They were bound to presume it was hostile.
HART: Kindly leave the naval side of the operation to me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, you are dealing with a situation completely outside of your own experience. And if you won't let me help you
HART: All right then, Doctor. What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Well, the key to this whole situation is at the castle.
BOWMAN: Sir, I think we've got something.
HART: Where?
BOWMAN: There, sir. Contact bearing two seven zero. Range, twenty thousand yards. Heading zero four seven.
JO: The submarine?
HART: Could be.
BOWMAN: I think it must be, sir.
DOCTOR: You see where the thing's heading? That beach by castle! Perhaps you'll believe me now.
TRENCHARD: That thing working all right?
MASTER: It still needs a few minor adjustments, that's all.
TRENCHARD: Look, I've been giving some thought to all this. It's going to be an enormous job coping with these creatures. We must give the authorities all the notice we can.
TRENCHARD: What was that?
MASTER: Just random feedback. It's nothing important.
TRENCHARD: Sounded like some sort of message.
MASTER: Look, Trenchard, I am trying to carry out a very difficult and complex task here, and I can't work if I'm being continually interrupted.
TRENCHARD: I'm terribly sorry, old chap. I'll leave you to it.
MASTER: Thank you.
TRENCHARD: Yes. 
TRENCHARD:  I tell you I must speak to the Minister. It's most important. Well, when do you expect him back? No, I can't tell you what's wrong. The security of the nation is at risk. Oh, very well, I'll hold on, but please hurry!
 
TRENCHARD:  No, it can't wait till the morning. Oh, you'll have to interrupt his meeting. This is a matter of national urgency. Oh, very well, as soon as he's free then. But if there's any unnecessary delay, believe me, you'll answer for it.
TRENCHARD: Guard?
TRENCHARD: What's happening, man?
DREW: They're all over the place, sir! They killed most of the lads!
TRENCHARD: Who? Who's attacking us?
DREW: Lizards, sir. Like that thing we saw on the beach. Come on, sir. They were after me.
TRENCHARD: Pull yourself together, man. Have you sent for help?
DREW: But it's no good, sir!
TRENCHARD: There's a direct line to Whitehall in my office. Use that.
DREW: Why can't you, sir?
TRENCHARD: I shall attend to the security of my prisoner. Go on, man. Move!
BOWMAN: No, it's no good, sir. Nothing.
JO: Well, if that thing was the submarine, why don't they answer your signals?
DOCTOR: Perhaps they can't.
HART: Tell the search coordinator to check that area immediately. It'll be light soon.
BLYTHE: Sir.
BOWMAN: Sir, contact fading.
HART: What?
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, we've got to find out what's happening at that castle.
BOWMAN: Contact lost.
HART: I want an armed party and two Land Rovers at the main gate in four minutes flat. Doctor?
HART: Come on. Follow in.
HART: Doctor!
HART: I don't understand why.
DOCTOR: The Master had no further use for him, that's why.
HART: But why did he help the Master in the first place?
DOCTOR: What would you say was Trenchard's strongest characteristic?
HART: Oh, I don't know. Patriotism, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Exactly. And the Master used that patriotism as a weapon.
BLYTHE: I've bought you some kai.
BOWMAN: Roger, search force. Over and out. Did you get through to Captain Hart?
BLYTHE: I telephoned the castle but they've already left.
BOWMAN: Well, they're definitely getting an echo and the object's moving.
BLYTHE: I see.
HART: What is it, Bowman? Have they re-established contact?
BOWMAN: It's a message from one of the search vessels, sir. They are getting an echo.
DOCTOR: The submarine?
BOWMAN: Yes, it's moving towards the fort now. Moving at about thirty knots.
HART: Depth?
BOWMAN: Steady at one five zero feet.
DOCTOR: The fort. Look, Captain Hart, can you lay on a diving vessel?
HART: Yes, the Reclaim's standing by on the search. But why?
DOCTOR: I want to inspect the sea bed at the base of that fort.
HART: All pre-dive checks completed?
WATTS: Yes. sir.
HART: Doctor, are you quite sure you want to go through with this?
DOCTOR: Yes, positive.
HART: Ready to lower the observation chamber?
WATTS: Yes, sir. The crew is standing by. We'll send a man down with him.
HART: Good.
DOCTOR: If you don't mind, I'd rather go down on my own.
HART: Well, I presume you're a trained diver in addition to your other accomplishments then, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Naturally. What's more, I know these creatures. I've encountered them before so I know what I'm looking for.
HART: All right, carry on.
WATTS: Aye, aye, sir.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: What is it, Jo?
JO: Is it really necessary for you to go down?
DOCTOR: How else am I going to make contact?
HART: Doctor?
HART: Well, good luck, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Captain Hart.
C.P.O: Everything okay, sir?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Chief.
C.P.O: Very good.
WATTS: Test the links.
WATTS: Pull up the links. Carry on lowering.
SAILOR: Twelve feet.
OFFICER: Carry on lowering.
HART: Let me speak to him. How's it going, Doctor?
DOCTOR : Splendid, thank you. A most interesting trip.
HART: You'll reach seabed in a few minutes. Tell us immediately if anything goes wrong.
DOCTOR : Don't worry. I'll be all right.
HART: You have reached seabed.
DOCTOR : Right.
HART: Are you all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm fine, thank you.
DOCTOR: Hang on a minute!
HART: Are you all right, Doctor? Shall we bring you up?
DOCTOR : Definitely not! I think I've just 
HART: Bring him up!
WATTS: Start winches! Hoist SCC!
OFFICER: High enough. Stop the lift.
Episode Five
JO: He's gone!
WALKER: Good morning, my dear. Captain Hart here?
BLYTHE: No sir, he's at sea.
WALKER: Well, I suppose that's the right place for a sailor, eh? What's your name?
BLYTHE: Blythe, sir.
WALKER: Walker. Parliamentary Private Secretary. Any chance of any breakfast?
BLYTHE: I'll call the steward, sir.
WALKER: Excellent!
WALKER: And, er, who are you?
BOWMAN: Leading Telegraphist Bowman, sir.
WALKER: Jolly good. Er, nothing very elaborate, my dear. Just eggs, bacon, toast, coffee. Oh, and a little rough-cut marmalade, if they've got it. How long is he likely to be? Captain Hart, I mean.
BLYTHE: I don't know, sir.
WALKER: Oh, well, now, I tell you what. You get him on your jolly old wireless and ask him to come over here at the double, will you?
BLYTHE: Send a signal to Captain Hart. Tell him that a Mister Walker is here to see him.
WALKER: Parliamentary Private Secretary.
BOWMAN: Er, aye aye, sir.
BLYTHE: I'll call the steward.
WALKER: Ah, and get me the morning papers, will you, there's a good girl.
BLYTHE: If I may ask, sir, what is the purpose of your visit?
WALKER: Why, all those ships sinking. I've come down to clear it up for you. The Minister's put me in full charge.
SEA DEVIL: This is our planet. My people ruled the Earth when man was only an ape.
DOCTOR: Your people went into hibernation and abandoned Earth to its fate.
SEA DEVIL: Our astronomers predicted that a great catastrophe would end all life on the face of the Earth.
DOCTOR: Yes, but the catastrophe that you predicted never happened. And the apes that you left behind on the surface to die became man.
SEA DEVIL: You know our history?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've encountered your people before. That is why I want to prevent a conflict that can only end in your destruction.
SEA DEVIL: We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet. Already we have begun to sink his ships.
DOCTOR: Yes, and already more ships are being sent to hunt you down.
SEA DEVIL: The submarine? We have captured it.
DOCTOR: You may win a few victories to begin with but eventually you're bound to lose.
SEA DEVIL: There are many thousands of our people in hibernation in this base. We have other colonies hidden all round the world. We shall be the victors in the war against mankind.
DOCTOR: But there's no need for a war. Why can't you share the planet?
SEA DEVIL: That would be impossible.
DOCTOR: The depths of the sea and those areas on Earth where man cannot live can be yours.
SEA DEVIL: And man would agree to that?
DOCTOR: There's a chance. Wouldn't it be better to try for a peace, than to launch yourself into a war that you cannot possibly win?
SEA DEVIL: I will consider what you have said.
DOCTOR: Let me return to the humans, and I will endeavour to make a peace for you.
SEA DEVIL: Perhaps it would be possible.
MASTER: No! The Doctor is your deadly enemy! He must be destroyed!
WALKER: Captain Hart, there's only one way to deal with this problem. You have to attack. Ugh. Oh, pass me the sugar, my dear, will you?
HART: My submarine is missing in that area. There's a chance that some of the crew may still be alive.
JO: And what about the Doctor? He may still be alive down there too!
HART: Yes.
WALKER: Well, this is war, my dear, and war calls for sacrifice. Any chance of any more toast, my dear?
BLYTHE: Yes, sir.
WALKER: Now, I've had a look at that UNIT file about the creatures that your friend the Doctor encountered in those caves. And do you know what happened? Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart blew the whole lot up.
JO: Maybe, but I bet he didn't do it by risking the lives of his own men.
WALKER: Well, that's as maybe, but our line is quite clear. Immediate retaliation with everything that we've got.
HART: I'm sorry, sir. I don't agree.
WALKER: Your opinion is quite immaterial, Captain Hart. The order's already been given. Ships are converging on this area from ports all over England.
HART: You're throwing away the lives of the men in that submarine, sir!
JO: And you'll probably killed the Doctor. Look, do you realise that that's murder?
WALKER: Murder? War always is, my dear. Where on Earth's that girl with my toast?
ADMIRAL: Make this to Ministry of Defence Navy. Special Task Force will be in position at thirteen fifty. That's all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: I beg you not to listen to this man. He's the personification of evil.
SEA DEVIL: The Master is our friend.
DOCTOR: He wants only to provoke a war.
MASTER: I do not! I came here to help you revive your people.
DOCTOR: Why should you need his help?
SEA DEVIL: Our hibernation unit is faulty.
MASTER: And I can now repair it for you.
DOCTOR: But why revive your people only to have them killed? Let me try and negotiate that peace for you.
MASTER: As you did before, Doctor? The last time this man encountered your race, he tricked them. The humans destroyed them all.
SEA DEVIL: Is that true?
DOCTOR: Yes. I tried to make peace but I failed.
MASTER: You see? He admits it. Man is weak. Your conquest will be easy.
DOCTOR: Believe me, man is not weak. He's only too proficient at devising weapons of annihilation and using them.
SEA DEVIL: He says man is weak. He says man is strong.
MASTER: He's lying! He's trying to frighten you!
SEA DEVIL: No. I do not think he lies. Perhaps it would be better to make peace. I shall have consider what you have said.
MASTER: Don't trust him!
ADMIRAL: Inform Ministry of Defence. Task Force now in position and ready to attack.
CPO: Aye, aye, sir.
BOWMAN: Roger Task Force. Over and out.
WALKER: What is it?
HART: The Task Force is in position, sir.
WALKER: Excellent! Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war, hmm? Well, tell them to carry out their orders. The attack will go ahead now.
JO: No! Look, please, you've got to do something! Can't you stop him?
HART: I wish you'd reconsider, sir.
WALKER: Captain Hart, I have full authority. Now, are you going to carry out my order or must I replace you with someone who will?
HART: I'm sorry, Jo.
ADMIRAL: Commence attack.
OFFICER: Urgent attack. In the bracket.
SEA DEVIL: You will negotiate a truce between my people and the humans.
DOCTOR: If you'll release the submarine and its crew, yes, as a gesture of good faith.
SEA DEVIL: Very well.
MASTER: You are throwing away the control of this planet! The humans will never make peace with you!
MASTER: Is this the promised peace? Can't you see that the humans are determined to wipe you out?
SEA DEVIL: You are right! These apes cannot be trusted! Take him away and kill him!
SEA DEVIL: Destroy the ships!
MASTER: No! Send your people down to the lower level. They'll be safe there.
SEA DEVIL: We must retaliate.
MASTER: Not yet. If I am to revive your people, I need time.
SEA DEVIL: What would you have us do?
MASTER: Convince the humans that their attack has been a success.
OFFICER: Sir?
BOWMAN: Roger, Task Force.
BOWMAN: Sir? Signal from Task Force. They report bodies and debris coming to the surface.
JO: Bodies? Did they say
BOWMAN: No, Miss, just the lizard things.
HART: We can call off the attack now, sir.
WALKER: Well, I'm not sure.
JO: Look, you've probably killed the Doctor and all those sailors. Aren't you satisfied?
HART: There is a chance there might be some survivors. Would you want it said that you unnecessarily endangered the lives of naval personnel, sir?
WALKER: All right. Have it your own way.
HART: Make to Task Force. Abandon attack.
BOWMAN:  Aye, aye, sir.
ADMIRAL: Cease fire.
MASTER: You see? My plan has worked.
SEA DEVIL: We could still destroy their ships before they are out of range.
MASTER: No, let them go. Let them think that they have won.
SEA DEVIL: You will now revive the rest of my people.
MASTER: Yes, but first the trigger mechanism on your reactivation unit is faulty. I need electronic equipment to build a new one.
SEA DEVIL: And where will you obtain this?
MASTER: The humans will provide it. We shall attack their base.
RIDGEWAY: Optimistic, Number One, but I admire your pluck. Here, give it to me.
MITCHELL: Would you like to try, sir?
DOCTOR: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Er, look, would you mind keeping back for a moment? That is if you want to get out? Thank you!
RIDGEWAY: Who the blazes are you?
DOCTOR: Look, I've no time to explain now. Where are the rest of your men?
RIDGEWAY: Still in the submarine.
DOCTOR: Is the submarine still operational?
RIDGEWAY: Should be.
MITCHELL: They've ripped out the communicators and the escape gear, as you can see.
RIDGEWAY: But left the engines alone.
MITCHELL: Yes.
DOCTOR: Where's the sub now?
RIDGEWAY: In a kind of undersea harbour.
DOCTOR: Can you find the way?
RIDGEWAY: I think so, yes.
DOCTOR: Right, you'd better lead on. Here, take this. It's a gun. Now come on, let's hurry.
SUMMERS: What about you, Chris?
LOVELL: I'll stick.
SUMMERS: You?
GIRTON: Twist. I'll stick.
SUMMERS: Right. Ha! Pay twenties.
GIRTON: Eighteen,
LOVELL: Nineteen. Well, that's it then. You've cleared me right out.
SUMMERS: What about you? Do you want to go on?
GIRTON: Not bothered.
LOVELL: What's that?
SUMMERS: Er, loose rigging.
LOVELL: Rigging?
SUMMERS: Yeah, what about a game of consequences? Yeah, I'll start.
SUMMERS: Right, it's your turn. Er, you've got to do what it says there.
LOVELL: That's not how you play consequences.
SUMMERS: It's the way we play.
LOVELL: Oh.
LOVELL: What's the matter with him?
SUMMERS: He's throwing a fit!
SUMMERS: Here, can't you see? He's not well.
DOCTOR: No, no! Don't kill him!
DOCTOR: There's no need to have done that!
RIDGEWAY: Any more of them, Summers?
SUMMERS: Yes, there's some more on guard up top, sir.
RIDGEWAY: We've dealt with them already. Right, action stations! We're getting under way.
MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.
SEA DEVIL: The humans have escaped.
MASTER: The submarine! They'll try to recapture it.
SEA DEVIL: Activate the force field!
MITCHELL: Sir, we've stopped moving.
RIDGEWAY: Increase revolutions.
MITCHELL: Maximum revs, sir.
DOCTOR: They're holding us back with some kind of force field.
SEA DEVIL: They cannot escape us now.
RIDGEWAY: There must be something we can do?
DOCTOR: Well, you could try firing your torpedoes at the cave wall and blasting yourselves free.
MITCHELL: We're still halfway in the cave, sir. We could blow ourselves up.
DOCTOR: That's a risk you'll have to take.
RIDGEWAY: Forward ends, this is the Captain. Load all bow tubes. Open one and two bow caps.
SEA DEVIL: Increase the force field.
RIDGEWAY: The engines. We're losing power.
DOCTOR: Well, hurry up and fire those torpedoes, or we'll be drawn back into the cave.
RATING : All bow heads open. Ready to fire, sir.
DOCTOR: Well, come on, man! You've got to risk it!
RIDGEWAY: Stand by bow salvo.
RATING : Standing by, sir.
RIDGEWAY: Fire one. Fire two.
SEA DEVIL: Increase the force field. They must not escape.
MASTER: It's no use. You're already too late.
RIDGEWAY: Any damage forward, Chief?
SUMMERS: No damage to tell, sir.
RIDGEWAY: Thank you. All right, stand by to surface, Number One. MITCHELL: Aye, aye, sir.
RIDGEWAY: We're going home.
SEA DEVIL: They can tell the humans how to find our base.
MASTER: It's of no importance. Before they can attack us we shall attack them.
JO: Doctor! I thought you were dead!
DOCTOR: Dead? No, I don't think so.
JO: When I saw that thing come up empty, I thought I'd never see you again.
WALKER: Well, well, well, so the heroes have returned.
DOCTOR: Captain Hart, what idiot ordered an all out attack just as I was on the verge of finding a peaceful solution?
JO: But it wasn't Captain Hart's fault. It was this
HART: I'm terribly sorry. This is Mister Walker. He's the Parliamentary Private Secretary in charge of this business.
WALKER: I'm the idiot you've just been talking about. Absolutely splendid lunch, old man.
DOCTOR: You ordered the attack?
WALKER: I did.
DOCTOR: Did you give any thought at all, sir, as to what you were doing?
WALKER: Our duty is to destroy the Queen's enemies. Don't you know your national anthem? Confound their politics, frustrate their knavish tricks.
DOCTOR: That, sir, is an extremely insular point of view. At the precise moment of the attack, I was negotiating a peace.
WALKER: Peace? Huh. What, when they've been attacking our shipping and heaven alone knows what? I think you've got it all wrong, old man. Seek and destroy. That's what you chaps say, isn't it?
DOCTOR: But the point, Mister Parliamentary Private Secretary, is that you have not destroyed. You have just made them angry. Very, very angry!
WALKER: I'm going to get on to the Minister, and I'm going to ask him to seek approval for an immediate attack with nuclear weapons.
DOCTOR: But that, sir, would be tantamount to murder.
WALKER: Oh, come, come, Doctor. You speak as if these creatures are human. We're not going to hand over the world to a lot of lizards, you know.
DOCTOR: You can share it with them, surely?
WALKER: Oh, come. Really, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, let me make one final attempt to negotiate.
WALKER: Well, you didn't get very far last time, did you?
DOCTOR: Just you think of it, sir. Think of it. Wouldn't you like to be the man behind a peaceful settlement? Walker the peacemaker, they'd call you. Or would you prefer to be known as the man responsible for launching a full scale war!
WALKER: Look, you can actually communicate with these creatures?
DOCTOR: Yes.
WALKER: And you'd be willing to undertake the preliminary negotiations yourself?
DOCTOR: Just leave it to me.
JO: Doctor, you're not thinking of going down there again?
DOCTOR: Jo, it's the only way.
JO: But, Doctor, it's far too dangerous!
DOCTOR: Don't you understand, Jo? I've got to go down there of my own free will as a gesture of good faith. Captain Hart, is that diving vessel still alongside?
HART: Yes, but I must say that I agree with Miss Grant.
DOCTOR: Then with your permission, Mister Walker?  My cape.
HART: Doctor, do you think you're doing the right thing?
DOCTOR: I'm doing the only thing possible, Captain Hart, if we're to avoid a major conflict.
HART: Suppose they won't listen to you?
JO: Doctor!
Episode Six
DOCTOR: All right, Captain Hart, get these two out of here.
JO: Doctor, look out!
MASTER: No! No, take them inside.
MASTER: Dear, oh dear, Doctor. Will you never learn?
MASTER: Now, Doctor, for your information the capture of this naval base is the first step in the return of this planet to its rightful owners. Right, bring him in, will you?
DOCTOR: How do you hope to achieve that?
MASTER: As you know, our friends here have underground and underwater bases all over the world. Well, I propose to reactivate them.
DOCTOR: You haven't reactivated them yet, have you.
MASTER: Er, not yet, no. But I can, with your help.
DOCTOR: I wondered why I was still alive.
MASTER: I advise you not to give me any trouble, Doctor. Not if you value the life of every man on this base.
HART: It's no good! They've cut the power supply!
JO: Shush! Look, there's still some of them in there.
WALKER: This is monstrous! What are you going to do about it, Captain Hart?
JO: Captain Hart, what about this?
HART: Yes, we should be able to open it. But I could never get through the ventilation shaft up there.
JO: No, but I could.
HART: The table.
JO: Right.
HART: Here.
WALKER: What, what are you doing? 
HART: We are going to put this table underneath that ventilation hatch and try to open it.
WALKER: Yes, but supposing you get caught? They might take reprisals against the innocent!
HART: A screwdriver. Jo, over there on the bench somewhere.
JO: Right.
WALKER: Don't you think we ought to leave these things to the Doctor? He said we ought to cooperate with them, you know?
HART: Tool kit. Underneath. Underneath the bench.
WALKER: Look, he's, er, he's not going to try and trick them, is he?
JO: Shush!
HART: That's it.
WALKER: This could have the most dreadful consequences! He, he, he made them a promise, you know.
HART: Yes, in order to save our lives! Now do you mind?
MASTER: Now then, Doctor, my problem is this. During millions of years of hibernation, the reactivation machinery has deteriorated. I now find it necessary to build a trigger mechanism for it.
DOCTOR: And how do you hope to do that?
MASTER: Well, by constructing a sonar device analogous to the laser. With this, I can not only pinpoint and revive the base by the sea fort, but every other base in the world.
DOCTOR: And you've convinced your reptilian friends that this will work?
MASTER: You know it'll work, with your cooperation. All the equipment we need is here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I suppose it's possible.
MASTER: I've drawn up some preliminary plans here. There.
DOCTOR: Good grief! What on Earth do you think you're doing?
MASTER: Why? What is the matter?
DOCTOR: Well, this circuit here, it's completely misplaced. And also you'll need far more power through to your main dipode. Give me a pencil, will you?
MASTER: There you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
MASTER: And you think you can correct this fault?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, given time. Now then, let's see.
WALKER: Are you, are you really going to let a mere child risk her life?
HART: Well I could never get through that ventilation shaft. Would you like to try? Come on, Jo. Now, once you're through the shaft, there's a hatch that comes out onto the roof of this building.
JO: Okay.
HART: Are you ready? Hup.
HART: That's it.
MASTER: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, I need a polarising condenser.
MASTER: Oh, allow me.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you.
JO:  Come on, Doctor! Hurry!
JO:  Come on!
DOCTOR: Now Jo, listen to me. In a few minutes time, I'm going to create a diversion. Now, as soon as it starts, you try and get Hart and the others out.
JO: But what about the guards?
DOCTOR: Don't worry about the guards. You leave them to me. Now, you hurry back there and wait for the off.
JO: Okay.
DOCTOR: All right?
MASTER: Well, Doctor?
DOCTOR: How about a little test? Right, here goes.
HART: What the blazes?
JO: The Doctor's doing it. Now come on, quickly, please.
HART: We must find the hovercraft pilot. JO: It's all right. I can fly one. Come on!
MASTER: Switch the power off!
MASTER: What happened?
DOCTOR: I must have had the frequency too high. I'm sorry about that. Oh, no, I see what it is. I had the output jack in the input socket. There. Yeah, there that should work all right now.
MASTER: We shan't know for sure till we get it back to their base and build it into their power system.
DOCTOR: We?
MASTER: Yes, Doctor. You're coming with me.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see.
SEA DEVIL: This noise, what has been happening?
MASTER: Teething troubles, that's all.
SEA DEVIL: It must not happen again. Is the work completed?
MASTER: Yes, I've now finished.
SEA DEVIL: Then we shall return to our base. Do you want him killed now?
MASTER: No. He might yet prove useful. Well, Doctor? Shall we go?
DOCTOR: If you insist.
SEA DEVIL: Guard them. Keep them safe. I must alert the others.
DOCTOR: Well, it seems as if things aren't quite going according to plan.
MASTER: Look, we must break out of here! I've got to get this device down to your base.
OFFICER : Myers, check that storeroom!
MYERS: Looks all right.
DOCTOR: Look out behind you!
MYERS: Would one of you gentlemen be the Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. This man is an extremely dangerous criminal, so guard him well. Now, have you seen Captain Hart and Miss Grant?
MYERS: I'm not sure, sir.
DOCTOR: Right, I'd better go and find them.
MYERS: Right, I'll stay with this bloke.
DOCTOR: Yeah, do that. And watch him!
MASTER: There's been a misunderstanding here, you know. I'm not the man that you want. There's been a mistake.
MASTER: You understand? A mistake.
MASTER: A mistake!
DOCTOR: Have you seen Jo Grant anywhere?
HART: She's on the beach.
MASTER: I'm sorry, Doctor.
WALKER: Now, perhaps you'll admit I was right all along. Massive nuclear strike. It's the only way.
JO: But not until we know what's happened to the Doctor.
BLYTHE: Excuse me, sir. I've just seen Lieutenant Scott. He said he saw the Doctor heading out to sea.
WALKER: Ha ha, gone to join his friends. Gone over to the other side.
BLYTHE: He seemed to be chasing another boat.
JO: He must have been after the Master.
WALKER: Well, be that as it may, they'll both have to take their chances. I'm going to put an end to these creatures right away. Kindly get me the Minister on the phone. I'm going to request that we launch a nuclear strike. Now.
SEA DEVIL: We want revenge on the human species. Many of my people have been killed.
MASTER: It was a necessary sacrifice.
SEA DEVIL: You said man was weak.
MASTER: So he is. Soon you will surge from the seas in your millions and exterminate him.
DOCTOR: Don't listen to him. Why begin a long and bloody war where thousands will be killed on both sides?
SEA DEVIL: We shall destroy man and reclaim the planet.
DOCTOR: Is there nothing I can say to make you reconsider?
SEA DEVIL: Nothing!
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
SEA DEVIL: Is the machine ready?
MASTER: It is.
SEA DEVIL: Then activate it.
MASTER: Allow me, Doctor. We don't want any accidents this time.
DOCTOR: The power may take some time to build up, you know.
MASTER: I suggest you now dispose of this man.
SEA DEVIL: Take them both to the cages.
MASTER: What's the meaning of this? I'm your ally!
SEA DEVIL: Both, I say! Take them!
MASTER: I helped you! I helped you!
MASTER: Look, I demand you take me back to your chief! Immediately!
DOCTOR: You seem to be losing your touch.
MASTER: Once they see that the device works properly, they'll release me.
DOCTOR: I very much doubt it. You see, before you reactivated it, I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow.
MASTER: You did what? You realise what will happen?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Do you?
MASTER: Well, there'll be a massive reverse feedback into their whole power system.
DOCTOR: Exactly. In about ten minutes from now the whole place should go up. Enjoy your revenge.
MASTER: Guards! Guards, come back! You must release me! I must talk to your chief! Let me out! We're all in danger! Let me out!
DOCTOR: You're wasting your time, you know. Even if they heard you, they couldn't do anything about it.
MASTER: Why?
DOCTOR: Well, I built a self-destruct mechanism into the main control switch. You can't turn it off.
MASTER: But but we'll both be killed.
DOCTOR: That's right. Unless we can both escape.
BOWMAN: Ships moving into position now, sir.
WALKER: Very well. This time we'll continue the attack until those creatures are finally destroyed. Now, how about some tea?
DOCTOR: You see? Come on.
DOCTOR: Well, just as I told you. Submarine escape equipment. Now, all we've got to do is find the airlock.
MASTER: Airlock?
DOCTOR: Yes, there must be one around here somewhere. Otherwise how else did we get down in those capsules? Here you are. Put this on.
WALKER: Ah, thank you, my dear. Ah ha! Smoked salmon. Delicious.
HART: Won't be long now.
JO: Suppose the Doctor manages to escape from that place?
HART: Not much chance, I'm afraid.
JO: Yes, but just suppose?
HART: Get a high speed hovercraft over that area. I want a complete sweep before the attack.
BOWMAN: Aye, aye, sir.
SERGEANT: All right?
MASTER: All right.
SEA DEVIL: This device is causing the power to overload.
BOWMAN: Large underwater explosion reported, sir.
WALKER: What? Has the attack started already?
BOWMAN: No, sir, before the attack. And they've picked up two survivors. One of them was in a bad way. They've radioed for an ambulance to stand by.
JO: Did they, did they say who?
BOWMAN: No, Miss.
JO: They said someone was hurt?
DOCTOR: It's the Master. He collapsed soon after they picked us up.
HART: Well then, Doctor, what happened?
DOCTOR: I managed to destroy their base for you.
HART: Thank goodness. Well done.
DOCTOR: Well, I did what I had to to prevent a war.
JO: He's dead.
MEDIC: We were too late. The doctor in the hovercraft said so.
DOCTOR: Doctor? What doctor?
SAILOR: I must obey. I must obey. I must obey. I must obey. I must obey. I must obey.
SAILOR: I must obey. I must obey.
