The Mind of Evil
Episode One
JO: It looks like Dracula's castle.
DOCTOR: Well, you're right about the castle bit. It used to be a fortress in the Middle Ages.
JO: Doctor? You'll need this.
DOCTOR: Thanks, Jo.
DOCTOR: Smile, Jo.
JO: What?
DOCTOR: You're on camera.
DOCTOR: Oh, good morning. Er, observers from UNIT. My admission pass.
OFFICER:  Right. Passes checked and satisfactory. Right, open the gates.
DOCTOR: Abandon hope all ye who enter here.
POWERS: Green! Calm the men down. The Governor's on his way.
GOVERNOR: Morning, Chief. Everything all right?
POWERS: Will be, sir.
GOVERNOR: Good, good. Well, let's see to it.
OFFICER : Keep that noise down!
 KETTERING: Why do they always have to make that stupid row?
SUMMERS: It always happens when sentences are being carried out.
GOVERNOR: George Patrick Barnham.
BARNHAM: No, you're not going to take me anywhere!
GOVERNOR: You have been sentenced by a court of law.
BARNHAM: Get away from me!
GOVERNOR: The time has come for that sentence to be carried out.
BARNHAM: Go on! Get out! All of you!
SUMMERS: I'll give him something to calm him.
BARNHAM: You won't give me nothing, mate. Get out, all of you!
POWERS: Pack it in, Barnham. You're just being stupid.
BARNHAM: You're not going to get me out there!
POWERS: Get him!
GOVERNOR: All right.
GUARD: You come easy.
BARNHAM: Take it easy, you'll break me arm.
GREEN: Sorry about the noise, ladies and gentlemen. Just a temporary disturbance.
JO: Temporary disturbance? It sounds like a full-scale riot.
DOCTOR: Morbid lot of sensation seekers.
JO: Then why did you insist on coming here?
DOCTOR: Scientific curiosity, my dear.
JO: Oh, yes.
DOCTOR: Something's been worrying me about this Keller process ever since I first heard of it. Ah, the curtain is about to go up.
POWERS: Keep them quiet.
GREEN: All right, chief.
GOVERNOR: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
DOCTOR: Good morning.
GOVERNOR: May I introduce Professor Kettering, who will explain the process you're about to see demonstrated.
KETTERING: Well, as you're no doubt aware, we no longer execute our hardened criminals and killers. Modern society has progressed far beyond that primitive form of retribution. Today, science
DOCTOR:  It all depends what you mean by progress, doesn't it.
KETTERING: Science has abolished the hangman's noose and substituted this infallible method. Professor Emil Keller
DOCTOR:  People who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground, I think.
KETTERING: For the benefit of the less sophisticated members of my audience, I will explain in very simple terms. Professor Emil Keller, the inventor of this process, discovered that anti-social behaviour was governed by certain negative or evil impulses. Now this machine, the Keller machine, extracts these impulses and leaves a rational, well-balanced individual.
DOCTOR: It doesn't.
JO: What?
KETTERING: May I be permitted to continue?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes, please do.
KETTERING: Thank you. The condemned man is placed here  after being tranquillised, with his head under this dome. A series of probes are attached to his skull so as to connect with the neural circuits. The extraction process is controlled here. The negative impulses are stored in that reservoir box there.
DOCTOR: Where do they go after that?
KETTERING: Nowhere, sir. I repeat, they are stored in the box.
DOCTOR: Which is now full of these negative or evil impulses.
KETTERING: Not full. The indicator registers only sixty five percent at this time. The machine has been used very successfully in Switzerland. A hundred and twelve cases have been processed to date and today we shall witness the one hundred and thirteenth. Thank you, Doctor Summers.
SUMMERS: Come on, old chap. Up you get.
KETTERING: When the process is completed, the negative impulses that made this man a criminal will have been removed. He will take his place as a useful, if lowly, member of society. Are you ready, Doctor Summers?
SUMMERS: Yes.
GOVERNOR: Let the sentence of the Court been carried out.
DOCTOR: I knew there was something evil about that machine.
SUMMERS: Kettering! Look at the dial.
KETTERING: What of it?
SUMMERS: It's never registered so high before.
GOVERNOR: Mister Kettering, what's happening?
GOVERNOR: Well?
KETTERING: A minor malfunction. The machine compensated. The process is completed satisfactorily.
DOCTOR:  Satisfactorily be blowed.
KETTERING: The subject will be taken away to recuperate and within an hour or two he will be perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: I admire your confidence, sir.
KETTERING: Thank you. That is all, gentlemen.
GOVERNOR: I take it everything was all right, Mister Kettering?
KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor.
DOCTOR: Then would you kindly explain, sir, that unfortunate man's reaction?
KETTERING: An excess of negative particles. The machine overreacted.
DOCTOR: In other words, you don't know.
KETTERING: May I ask who you are, sir?
GOVERNOR: The Doctor is Scientific Advisor to UNIT, Mister Kettering.
KETTERING: UNIT?
GOVERNOR: United Nations Intelligence Taskforce.
KETTERING: How interesting, though I fail to see what concern it is
DOCTOR: UNIT, sir, was set up to deal with new and unusual menaces to mankind. And in my view, this machine of yours is just that. Jo.
SUMMERS: Right.
KETTERING: Well?
SUMMERS: Nothing much wrong physically. Respiration normal, pulse rate's a little high but that's usual after the process.
KETTERING: Ah, exactly. A completely successful treatment.
SUMMERS: The reaction was unusually violent.
KETTERING: Really, my dear Summers, you're as bad as that interfering fool from UNIT.
SUMMERS: Excuse me.
SUMMERS: Medical wing. Yes? What? Have you told the Governor? I'll be right over.
SUMMERS:  Come with me.  You stay with the patient.
KETTERING: Anything the matter?
SUMMERS: There's been some kind of an accident in the process room. They think the man's dead.
SUMMERS: What happened?
GREEN: I don't know, sir.
GOVERNOR: What happened?
GREEN: I don't know, sir. I was coming along the corridor and I heard him screaming.
DOCTOR: Is he dead?
SUMMERS: Yes, he's dead.
KETTERING: Probably a heart attack. Delayed shock from seeing the process.
DOCTOR: Perhaps, but I doubt it. Might I suggest an immediate investigation into his past medical history and a post mortem.
SUMMERS: Yes. Yes, a good idea. I'll see to it right away. Get a stretcher, will you?
JO: Doctor? Did you see his face? He looks terrified. And those marks, like
DOCTOR: Bites and scratches? Yes, I know.
JO: Look, I think we'd better get on to the Brigadier.
DOCTOR: Yes, I agree, Jo, but not just yet. Now, let me get that post mortem first. It'll give me more to go on.
JO: All right. Anyway, I don't think he'd thank us for disturbing him right now.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
JO: He did tell you all about it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: All about what?
JO: Today's the first ever World Peace Conference. UNIT's handling all the security arrangements.
BRIGADIER:  Yes, that's all very well, sir, but in my opinion.
BRIGADIER: Yes, I see, sir. Of course, sir. I take it that is your final decision? Very well, sir, goodbye.
YATES: Trouble, sir?
BRIGADIER: That was the Ministry. UNIT'll be responsible for the safe transport of the missile. It's been cleared with Geneva.
YATES: Well, that's all we needed. What with the peace conference on our hands as well.
BRIGADIER: Yes. I want you to take charge of this escort detail, Captain Yates. I've got quite enough on my plate as it is.
YATES: I'll get onto it right away.
BRIGADIER: Oh, is the Doctor back from Stangmoor yet?
YATES: No sir. Er, what exactly is he doing down there?
BRIGADIER: Observing new development in the treatment of criminals, I believe. Oh well, I suppose it'll keep him out of mischief. By the way, how are things at the conference?
YATES: Oh, all running smoothly, sir.
BRIGADIER: I only hope it lasts.
BRIGADIER: All right, Corporal Bell. Yes, Captain Chin Lee, what can I do for you?
CHIN LEE: Brigadier, an outrage has been committed against the Chinese people's delegation. As you are in charge of security arrangements, we hold you directly responsible.
BRIGADIER: What is it now, Captain?
CHIN LEE: Important state documents have been stolen from General Cheng Teik's suite.
YATES: That's impossible. There's a twenty four hour guard on all the delegate's suites.
CHIN LEE: Nevertheless, the theft has occurred. Your guards are inefficient. Perhaps they take bribes?
BRIGADIER: That is an insulting suggestion, Captain. I will not tolerate any! Very well, Captain, I'll investigate the matter immediately.
CHIN LEE: I must warn you that this puts the success of the peace conference in grave jeopardy. We suspect the imperialist Americans of this crime.
BRIGADIER: Naturally. I assure you that every effort will be made to locate the missing papers and to punish whoever is responsible.
CHIN LEE: Any further trouble and our delegation will withdraw from this conference.
BRIGADIER: More trouble.
YATES: Mmm, pity. She's quite a dolly.
DOCTOR: And you are still convinced this Keller process is working normally?
KETTERING: Yes, of course it is. I mean, you've just seen Barnham.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I've seen him.
KETTERING: Look, Emil Keller himself installed it here. I worked closely with him. I know every facet of the process.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But I still don't like it.
GOVERNOR: What?
DOCTOR: Interfering with the mind, Governor. It's a dangerous business.
KETTERING: Well, it's hardly your concern, is it?
DOCTOR: Professor Kettering, it is everyone's concern!
SUMMERS : After you.
GOVERNOR: Ah, Doctor Summers. Any news for us?
SUMMERS: I've got the post mortem report.
KETTERING:: Well?
SUMMERS: The deceased's name was Arthur Linwood, a medical student in his final year.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, but what did he die of?
SUMMERS: Heart failure.
KETTERING: Watching the process was too much for him.
SUMMERS: But he didn't have a weak heart, Mister Kettering.
DOCTOR: Anything in his medical history?
SUMMERS: Yes, I called his hospital. He suffered from a fear of certain animals.
DOCTOR: Oh, which ones?
SUMMERS: Well, apparently, in the laboratory he was absolutely terrified of
DOCTOR: Rats?
SUMMERS: Yes. 
DOCTOR: Tell me, these marks on his face on his face and neck, these bites and scratches, could they have been caused by rats?
SUMMERS: Certainly they could, yes.
GOVERNOR: But there are no rats in this room. There's none in the entire prison.
SUMMERS: Yet all the indications are that he was attacked by a hoard of them, and the shock killed him.
KETTERING: You must be mistaken.
DOCTOR: But Linwood is dead.
KETTERING: Because of heart failure!
DOCTOR: No, Professor Kettering, because of this machine.
KETTERING: I tell you that man's death had nothing to do with this machine, and if you were a scientist you'd understand.
DOCTOR: If I were a scientist? Let me tell you, sir, that I am a scientist, and I have been for several thousand. Jo.
KETTERING: The man's mad.
JO: On the contrary, sir, he happens to be a genius. I do wish you'd listen to him.
SUMMERS: Victor?
GOVERNOR: I think you'd better give this machine a thorough check, Professor Kettering.
KETTERING: Yes, of course, Governor. But I assure you there's no reason for anxiety.
GOVERNOR: All the same, better safe than sorry?
YATES: I'll give you the final security schedules just as soon as I've had a chance to clear them with the Brigadier.
BELL: A call for you on line one, sir.
BRIGADIER: Oh, put it through, will you?
YATES: Right, right, I'll ring you back within twenty minutes.
BELL: UNIT HQ? Oh, good morning, sir.
BELL : Yes, certainly Captain, I'm just
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? I see. You're sure? Very well, continue the search.  Captain Yates, will you come in for a moment please?
BRIGADIER: Oh, sit down. Well, there's no trace of Chin Lee's missing papers. Our people have turned the place inside out. It wouldn't surprise me if she lost them herself.
BELL: Excuse me, sir. Captain Chin Lee on the phone. Do you want to speak to her?
BRIGADIER: Yes, I'll speak to her.
BELL: Hotline, sir.
BRIGADIER: I wonder what she's complaining of this time? Yes, good afternoon, Captain Chin Lee. What can I do for you? Yes, I see. No, don't touch anything. I'll be over at once.
YATES: More stolen papers, sir?
BRIGADIER:  Get my car ready at once.
BELL : Right, sir.
BRIGADIER: We've got real trouble this time. The Chinese delegate's dead.
OFFICER: All right men, keep that noise down.
POWERS: Starting up again, are they?
GREEN: Just like before. I don't what it is.
KETTERING: No, no.
GOVERNOR: Dead. Do you know how it happened, Roland?
SUMMERS: I'm not sure. It's incredible, really.
DOCTOR: Oh, come on, man, come on.
SUMMERS: From the position of the body, tinge of the skin
DOCTOR: Well?
SUMMERS: All the symptoms are consistent with death by drowning.
GOVERNOR: But that's ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Like the rats?
SUMMERS: Shall I go and check on his medical record?
DOCTOR: Yes, a good idea. How long would you say he'd been dead?
SUMMERS: Oh, a matter of minutes, five at the outside.
JO: That must have been about the time the riot started.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly.
GOVERNOR: Are you suggesting there's some connection?
DOCTOR: This machine has the power to affect men's minds, Governor, and it's growing stronger.
GOVERNOR: Oh, come now, Doctor. It's only a machine.
DOCTOR: Yes, maybe, but nevertheless it's dangerous and it should be destroyed now!
GOVERNOR: Well, I've no authority to do that. I'll report your recommendations to the Home Office but they'll have to decide.
DOCTOR: I wonder how many deaths it'll take to convince them?
CHIN LEE: First theft, Brigadier, now murder. What are you going to do about it?
BRIGADIER: Who else knows about this?
CHIN LEE: No one. I called you at once.
YATES: Shall I call the police. sir?
BRIGADIER: Yes, just a courtesy call, but tell them we'll handle this ourselves. And I want a full check on all movements in and out of this suite before Cheng Teik's death. And no press. 'D' notice.
YATES: Right, sir.
BRIGADIER: And get the Doctor back from Stangmoor, will you? I want him here.
YATES: Yes, sir.
BRIGADIER: Now then, Captain. I'd like you to tell me exactly what happened, please? In detail.
CHIN LEE: My appointment with the General was for twelve pm. There were some details to discuss about the conference.
BRIGADIER: And you were punctual?
CHIN LEE: I am always punctual. I showed my pass to your UNIT sentry and entered as the clock was striking twelve.
BRIGADIER: Go on.
CHIN LEE: There is nothing more to tell. I saw the General's body and phoned you.
BRIGADIER: Immediately?
CHIN LEE: Of course.
BRIGADIER: Excuse me a moment, will you? Oh, Corporal Bell? I'd like you to.
BRIGADIER:  I want you to make an exact check on the time of Chin Lee's phone call.
BELL: Right, sir.
GOVERNOR: I'm sorry, Doctor. That's my final word. I'll suspend further use of the Keller process, I'll put this room out of bounds. But that's all I can do without higher authority.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, all right. Well, I'd better make this machine safe.
JO: Can I help?
DOCTOR: On my own.
GOVERNOR: Is that wise?
DOCTOR: Perhaps not.
JO: Well then
DOCTOR: But I prefer to work that way. Tell me, how long has this machine been installed?
GOVERNOR: Nearly a year. Emil Keller came over from Switzerland to supervise the installation.
DOCTOR: I see. Did he have an assistant?
GOVERNOR: Mmm hmm. A rather attractive Chinese girl.
BELL:  Yes. Mmm. Yes, right. Thank you.
BRIGADIER: Thank you. You telephoned me immediately?
CHIN LEE: Yes.
BRIGADIER: No, Captain, you didn't. You telephoned me at exactly twelve twenty four.
CHIN LEE: You must be mistaken.
BRIGADIER: You called me on a security line. All security calls are logged. Well, Captain? Why did you wait for nearly half an hour before reporting the crime?
SUMMERS: How do you feel?
BARNHAM: Fine. Fine. Have I been ill?
SUMMERS: Yes, but you're all right now.
BARNHAM: Are you a doctor? 
SUMMERS: Mmm hmm. Don't you remember? I'm Doctor Summers. Just try and rest. You'll be all right.
BARNHAM: Anything you say, Doctor.
SUMMERS: Well, he seems fully recovered, physically.
JO: And mentally?
SUMMERS: Well, his memory's a bit hazy but it's only to be expected.
JO: And has the process harmed him?
SUMMERS: I, I don't know, Miss Grant.
JO: The Doctor was wondering about Mister Kettering's medical history?
SUMMERS: Oh, yes, I've got the post mortem report through there.
JO: What's the verdict?
SUMMERS: Kettering's lungs were full of water. He drowned in the middle of a perfectly dry room.
Episode Two
JO: Doctor? What's the matter? Let's sit down. It's all right, there's nothing there.
JO: There's nothing there. Come and sit. There's nothing, Doctor. It's me, Jo. It's all right.
DOCTOR: Jo. Jo, what are you doing here?
JO: Well, you wanted this report on Kettering. I got it from Doctor Summers.
DOCTOR: Look, I told you to take that directly to the Governor's office.
JO: I thought it was important.
DOCTOR: So are my instructions, Jo. So are my instructions. You might have been killed.
JO: Me killed? It seemed that you were the one in danger. You looked as if you were fighting something that wasn't there.
DOCTOR: Well, it was there, Jo. At least it was until you distracted it. Your coming in broke its grip on my mind. Let me see that report.
JO: You were right about Kettering. He did have a morbid fear of water.
DOCTOR: So he drowned in a perfectly dry room.
JO: Doctor, what did you see?
DOCTOR: Fire.
JO: But why should you?
DOCTOR: Well, some time ago, Jo, I witnessed a terrible catastrophe. A whole world just, just disappeared in flames. Well, this machine picked that memory out of my mind and used it to attack me.
JO: This fire you saw, it wasn't real.
DOCTOR: Neither was the water, nor the rats, yet Linwood is dead and so is Professor Kettering. We believe what our minds tell us to, Jo.
JO: If this machine's so dangerous, why not just blow it up? Destroy it.
DOCTOR: Because those idiots in authority won't let me, that's why. I'm trying to find a way of controlling it. So, if you've quite finished asking questions?
JO: All right, I'm going.
JO: Mike? What are you doing here?
YATES: The Brigadier's orders. I'm afraid, Doctor, you've got to come back to London with me.
DOCTOR: Nonsense. I can't possibly leave Stangmoor.
YATES: You've got to, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'm telling you I'm not leaving.
YATES: I'm sorry, Doctor. You're coming back with me, even if I have to use force.
DOCTOR: Venusian Karate. I think you'll find that a lot harder than you imagine, young man.
YATES: Look, Doctor, he really does need you. Things are going very badly at the peace conference. The Chinese delegate's dead and we think he's been murdered.
DOCTOR: Murdered? Yes, all right, Captain Yates. I'll come with you.
YATES: Thank you.
JO: Doctor? I'll say here and look after things for you.
DOCTOR: Look, Jo, for once in your young life, do you think you could do exactly as I ask?
JO: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Now go and see the Governor. Tell him to lock and bar that door. No one is to enter this room. No one. Do you understand?
JO: Just leave everything to me.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm rather afraid I'll have to. Try and keep out of trouble, will you?
JO: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Come along, Captain Yates, what are you waiting for?
JO: Doctor! Mike.
MAN: Are you all right?
BENTON: Yes. Yes, I'm all right, thank you.
BRIGADIER: You lost her?
BENTON: Yes, sir. She gave me the slip. One minute I had her well in sight and next she just
BRIGADIER: She vanished in a puff of smoke.
BENTON: No, sir. I got this sort of throbbing in my head. I guess I fainted. When I came to, she'd gone.
BRIGADIER: Throbbing in the head? Fainting? You're too delicate for intelligence work, Benton. You'd better go and lie down.
BENTON: Right, sir. Sorry, sir.
BRIGADIER: Dismissed, Sergeant. Just get out of my sight.
DOCTOR: I see you're in your usual sweet affable mood, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: When you've quite finished grinning like a Cheshire cat, Captain Yates!
YATES: Sir.
DOCTOR: Right, now, Brigadier, would you kindly tell me what all this fuss is about?
YATES: Mister Curry, are you still there? Oh good. No, no, for a moment I thought we'd been cut off.
YATES : As I was saying, the escort will be under my command and will consist of myself, a Sergeant and four motorcycle outriders.
CURRY : It's a bit light, isn't it, Captain, considering the importance of this weapon.
YATES : We'll only make ourselves conspicuous if we surround it with a small army, won't we?
CURRY : Oh, all right. I suppose you people know best.
YATES : Our ETA with you will be at oh eight fifteen hours.
CURRY : And you will let me know the route?
YATES : Yes, I'll ring you through with the route as soon as it's finalised. Goodbye, sir.
CURRY : Goodbye.
BRIGADIER: All right, all right, all right, all right, Doctor! You win.
DOCTOR: And you'll back up my report to the Home Office calling for a complete ban on the Keller process.
BRIGADIER: Yes.
DOCTOR: And you'll get in touch with the Home Secretary and make sure that he takes some action.
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor, and if that doesn't do any good, I personally will go down to Stangmoor and blow the blasted machine up myself. Now, are you or are you not going to help me with this case?
DOCTOR: My dear Lethbridge Stewart, your word is my command. You know that you only have to ask.
BRIGADIER: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Well, where on earth do you think you're going?
BRIGADIER: We are going to see the new Chinese delegate, Mister Fu Peng.
DOCTOR: Fu Peng? He must be Hokien.
BRIGADIER: No, no, no, Doctor. He's Chinese. Now, come along.
YATES: Excuse me.
BRIGADIER: Later!
DOCTOR: Yes, it's going to be one of those days. Cheshire cat, Captain Yates, Cheshire cat.
BRIGADIER : Doctor!
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm coming.
YATES:  Get me transport, will you?
TRANSPORT : Transport?
YATES : Captain Yates here. I'd like you to lay on a motorcycle escort of four and a jeep for oh seven hundred hours tomorrow.
TRANSPORT : Right-o, sir. Where's your rendezvous, sir?
YATES : Here at HQ. I'll take the party down myself.
TRANSPORT : Right-o, sir.
BRIGADIER: Oh, Mister Fu Peng? I'm Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT command. I'm in charge of all security arrangements. And this is our scientific advisor.
DOCTOR:  This unworthy person welcomes you and delights in your safe arrival.
FU PENG: Thank you for your courtesy and welcome. It is I who am delighted to meet such a charming person in this barbaric country.  It is rare to meet a westerner who knows my language.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Actually I fear my Hokien is somewhat rusty.
FU PENG: On the contrary, it is excellent.
DOCTOR: Well, it's many years since I've had a chance to use it.
DOCTOR: I remember once having a conversation with Tse-Tung.
FU PENG: Tse-Tung? But that is the personal name of our chairman, Mao Tse-Tung.
DOCTOR: He himself gave me leave to use it.
BRIGADIER: Yes, if we could just discuss the immediate problem.
FU PENG: You will take some tea?
DOCTOR: Kam si ya.
FU PENG: Tang pei lai. Sing- sen.
OFFICER: Come on, Mailer, out you come. Get behind me there.
GREEN: Right, Vosper, come on.
GREEN: Right, Vosper, get busy. I want this place cleaned up properly.
SUMMERS: Hello.
JO: How is he?
SUMMERS: Fit as a fiddle, aren't you, Barnham? Barnham.
SUMMERS: Visitor for you. Pull up a chair.
JO: Hello.
BARNHAM: Thank you. Do I know you?
JO: Well, we've sort of met.
BARNHAM: It's just that I can't seem to remember anybody or anything very well.
JO: Don't you remember being treated by the Keller machine?
BARNHAM: It's all a bit of a blank, I'm afraid. Do you know, you wouldn't believe this, but I couldn't even remember me own name. Not until the Doctor there told me.
JO: Well, I'm glad to see you looking so much better. Bye.
BARNHAM: Thanks very much for the chocolates, Miss.
JO: Well, everything seems all right.
SUMMERS: I'm not sure. I still think that in Barnham's case the machine has overreacted. It's extracted all the negative impulses from his brain.
JO: So what does that make him now?
SUMMERS: It depends how you look at it. An idiot, or a saint.
VOSPER: Getting a bit noisy, ain't they, Mister Green?
GREEN : Right, let's keep those prisoners quiet. All of you! Keep quiet.
POWERS: All right! Keep that noise down!
OFFICER: All right, you heard the Governor. Keep the noise down! Okay, Mailer.
POWERS: Come on, Vosper, outside.
MAILER: Proper little home from home, ain't it?
GOVERNOR: You'll be in this cell until sentence is carried out, Mailer.
MAILER: Oh, don't put any money on it, Governor. No one's turning me into a zombie and that includes you, mate.
POWERS: That's enough of that, Mailer.
GOVERNOR: All right, Chief.
POWERS: Watch him.
OFFICER: Yes sir. 
OFFICER: Fancy a game then, Harry? Pass the time?
MAILER: Drop dead.
OFFICER: Suit yourself. Come on, let's have a game. Right, you're black.
OFFICER 2: Cup of tea?
OFFICER: No, I'm all right.
DOCTOR: Wa hi, Peng-san. I should be delighted to dine with you soon.
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, there are a few questions that I should like to ask, Mister Fu Peng.
BRIGADIER: What did he say?
DOCTOR: Dried squid and stewed jellyfish, my dear fellow. For our dinner. Beng ahn, my dear Peng-san.
FU PENG: Cheng lu. Till our next meeting then, my dear Sing-sen.
BRIGADIER: I really must insist on asking
DOCTOR: Come along, my dear fellow. We've got a great deal of work to do, you know.
BRIGADIER: Could you perhaps?
MAILER: Well, where's this grub then? You planning to starve me to death?
OFFICER: It's coming, Mailer, it's coming.
MAILER: Yeah, so is Christmas.
MAILER: Right! Easy! Keys. Come on. Now move it!
BRIGADIER: Are you're seriously suggesting there's a connection?
DOCTOR: Another mysterious death with unexplained marks on the face and body? There's got to be.
BRIGADIER: But this Keller machine of yours is miles away.
YATES: Excuse me, sir. We're about ready for off, sir, if you'll just okay the movement order and route plans.
DOCTOR: Off for another little trip, Captain Yates?
YATES: Not exactly, Doctor. We're moving the Thunderbolt.
DOCTOR: The what?
YATES: The Thunderbolt. It's a nuclear powered missile with a warhead full of nerve gas.
DOCTOR: I thought they'd outlawed those things?
BRIGADIER: Oh yes, they have. This one's on its way to the naval dockyard. They're going to dump it at the bottom of the ocean.
DOCTOR: With the peace conference going on it's not the most tactful time to be trundling rockets about, is it?
BRIGADIER: I see you're taking Benton.
YATES: If it's okay with you, sir?
BRIGADIER: Oh, you're welcome to him. Just make sure he doesn't lose the missile for you.
YATES: Sir?
BRIGADIER: Well, he somehow managed to lose a Chinese girl in broad daylight.
DOCTOR: Chinese girl? What Chinese girl?
BRIGADIER: All right, Yates, carry on. Good luck.
YATES: Oh, thank you, sir.
DOCTOR: Brigadier, what Chinese girl?!
BRIGADIER: Well, Captain Chin Lee, the General's aide. I thought she was implicated so I had her followed. Benton lost her.
DOCTOR: That's it then. That's the link.
BRIGADIER: What is?
DOCTOR: When Emil Keller installed his machine at Stangmoor prison, he had a Chinese girl with him as an assistant.
BRIGADIER: It could be coincidence.
DOCTOR: Coincidence, my foot. You'd better put out a general alert for that Chinese girl, Brigadier. She's got to be found and quick!
MASTER: You're late, Captain.
CHIN LEE: My apologies, Master.
MASTER: You did well at the conference. Now I have another little task for you.
CHIN LEE: No, no, please, no! Not
MASTER: You will obey me!
CHIN LEE: I will obey you, Master.
MASTER: Tonight, you will kill the American delegate.
CHIN LEE: Tonight, I will kill the American delegate.
MASTER: Good. Now you may go.
MAILER: Now just one peep out of you, that's all!
VOSPER: I've done the phone, Harry.
MAILER: Good boy.
VOSPER: But they've got the wing surrounded.
GREEN: You've got no chance.
MAILER: Shut up! They won't come in. Not while we've got so many screws here.
VOSPER: Are you sure?
MAILER: They can't get in.
VOSPER: We can't get out!
MAILER: Oh, we'll get out. Now shut up. Let me think. Here, you, take over.
VOSPER: We can't stay here, Harry. They'll starve us out.
MAILER: What we want is hostages.
VOSPER: We've got 'em!
MAILER: We need more. Now, if we cut around the kitchen, get to the prison hospital, maybe we can grab a doctor. All right? Now you lot stay here! Come on.
JO: It's no good. The line's dead.
SUMMERS: I think you'd better go to the admin block, Miss Grant.
JO: What about you?
SUMMERS: I'll stay here. Someone's bound to get hurt by the time they've finished.
MAILER: Out. Get him. You're not going to give me any trouble, are you?
DOCTOR: Look, operator, I've been waiting some considerable time now for my call to Stangmoor prison. 
BRIGADIER: All right, keep looking. Yes, let me know as soon as you hear anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, all right, yes. I'll hang on. There's some trouble there with the lines.
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? What? No, don't arrest her. I'll deal with this myself. Message from one of my agents. Chin Lee's turned up again.
DOCTOR: Chin Lee? Where?
BRIGADIER: She's just been seen entering the Chinese delegate's suite.
CHIN LEE: Room four hundred and eleven. Hello, is the American delegate there, please? This is Captain Chin Lee of the Chinese people's delegation. I wish to speak to Senator Alcott urgently. Yes, thank you.
ALCOTT: Hello? This is Senator Alcott speaking. Yes, Captain, what can I do for you?
CHIN LEE: Comrade Fu Peng wishes to see you immediately and wonders if you could come to our suite.
ALCOTT: What, at this time of night?
CHIN LEE: It is a matter of vital importance. He wishes to assure you that it is to your country's advantage.
ALCOTT: But Captain, this is highly irregular.
CHIN LEE: He asks that you come alone. The subject is most secret.
ALCOTT: All right, I'll be right over.
CHIN LEE: Your time will not be wasted, Senator. 
ALCOTT: Hello? Anyone home? Mister Fu Peng?
ALCOTT: Mister Fu Peng? Oh. May I ask what this is all about, Captain?
CHIN LEE: Of course.
ALCOTT: Well, where's Mister Fu Peng?
CHIN LEE: He will be here soon. Sit down.
ALCOTT: Now look, Captain, I'm in the middle of my dinner and I
CHIN LEE: Sit down, please.
ALCOTT: All right, but make it short, will you?
ALCOTT: What are you doing?
ALCOTT: What's this noise? This noise in my head. This terrible sound! This sound. What's happening?
ALCOTT: Get back! Get back, I tell you! Get back! Don't come near me!
Episode Three
DOCTOR: No, Brigadier!
FU PENG: That was one of the legendary monsters of my people.
DOCTOR: A collective hallucination, gentlemen, nothing more. Who's that?
BRIGADIER: Senator Alcott. Is he dead?
DOCTOR: No, but he's suffering from acute shock.
FU PENG: Sing-sen!
DOCTOR: Yes?
FU PENG: What is this?
DOCTOR: Well, it's a telepathic amplifier.
BRIGADIER: Is that what caused the hallucinations?
DOCTOR: No, not caused them. No, it merely picks up the impulses and projects them through Chin Lee's mind.
BRIGADIER: Impulses? From where?
DOCTOR: Well, unless I'm very much mistaken, from the Keller machine at Stangmoor prison.
MAILER: Come on! Move it!
SUMMERS: You'll break my arm!
VOSPER: Harry! Harry!
MAILER: Hello?
VOSPER: The whole wing's surrounded. There's hundreds of them.
MAILER: So what?
SUMMERS: Show some sense, Mailer. You'll never get away with it.
VOSPER: They'll rush us any minute.
MAILER: Not while we've got these two, will they. Now listen, get back, fix that phone. I want to talk to the Governor. Down.
VOSPER: What are you going to do with them?
MAILER: Put them in the guest room, aren't I. Come on, down.
FU PENG: Doctor, I've understood very little of what you have been saying. Please, explain more clearly.
DOCTOR: Wa ai, Peng-san. Wa ai. Chin Lee was being used by someone who was trying to drive this world into war.
FU PENG: You will find this person and punish him?
DOCTOR: Yes, I will if I can.
FU PENG: Then I leave matters to you. I must go to my Embassy.
DOCTOR: Hang ahn, Peng-san.
FU PENG: Din gon ba bi lu, Sing-sen.
DOCTOR: May God go with you also.
DOCTOR: Chin Lee? Chin Lee, listen to me. Can you hear me?
DOCTOR: Cantonese. Noh, hi lay pen lau Chin Lee. Ala mar. Ala mar? You must trust me.
CHIN LEE: Something happened. Something terrible!
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, but it was in your mind. It was only in your mind. Now I want to ask you some questions.
CHIN LEE: Questions?
DOCTOR: Yes. About Emil Keller and your visit to Stangmoor prison.
MAILER: Hello, Len. I thought you'd fixed the phones.
VOSPER: Sorry, Harry, no luck.
MAILER: How am I going to make a deal with the Governor if I can't even talk to him? All right, open this up.
VOSPER: Yeah.
VOSPER: All right, you two, on your feet.
JO: No, don't!
JO: Don't!
MAILER: Come on. On your feet. You're getting out of here.
JO: At last you've seen some sense.
MAILER: Not you, darling! Now, you're going to take a message to the Governor.
SUMMERS: What message?
MAILER: I want safe conduct out of here for me and all the mob in B wing.
SUMMERS: I'm not leaving here without Miss Grant.
MAILER: Oh yes you are.
JO: I'll be all right.
MAILER: Come on, on your way. Out.
MAILER: If you've got any sense, you'll get some beddie-byes. Goodnight.
BENTON: Don't tell me your troubles, mate! I want that missile off the launching pad and on to the three tonner. Now get that crane in!
YATES: What's going on, Sergeant? That missile should have been off the pad ten minutes ago.
BENTON: I'm sorry sir, but we're having trouble with the crane.
YATES: No excuses, Sergeant. Just get on with it.
BENTON: Right sir. Now come on, you men, wake your ideas up!
DOCTOR: Rise and shine, Brigadier. I've brought Captain Chin Lee here to see you.
BRIGADIER: Oh, er, good morning, Captain. Won't you sit down?
CHIN LEE: Thank you.
BRIGADIER:  Corporal Bell?
BELL : Yes, sir?
BRIGADIER: Lay on some coffee, will you?
BELL : Right, sir.
DOCTOR: Right now, Brigadier. I think you'll find that Captain Chin Lee can cast considerable light on what's been happening.
BRIGADIER: Well, I'm glad to hear that someone can.
BRIGADIER: Yes? Oh, morning Yates. Oh. Oh, I see. It's Yates. He's had a hold up with his, er, cargo.
DOCTOR: Yes, well tell him to be careful with his, er, cargo.
BRIGADIER: Sorry, Yates, what was that? Chin Lee? Well
BRIGADIER : As a matter of fact, there's been some trouble.
YATES : What happened, sir?
BRIGADIER : As far as I can gather, she tried to scare the American delegate to death. The Doctor stopped her.
YATES : I don't quite follow, sir.
BRIGADIER : Quite frankly, Yates, neither do I. It's something to do with the Keller machine at Stangmoor. Anyway, Chin Lee's with me now.
MASTER: Stangmoor prison.
BRIGADIER: Yes, but where did you first meet this man, Emil Keller?
CHIN LEE: At an Embassy reception. He told me of the Keller process for reforming the habitual criminal, and invited me to visit Stangmoor prison with him.
BRIGADIER: And you agreed to go?
CHIN LEE: Prison reform is high on our list of priorities in Peking!
BRIGADIER: Ah. And can you tell us what happened at Stangmoor?
CHIN LEE: I know that we went to the process room. I cannot remember.
BRIGADIER: Well, did you see him again?
CHIN LEE: Yes, many times, but whenever I think about it, my mind becomes so confused.
DOCTOR: Post-hypnotic block. His usual technique.
BRIGADIER: Whose usual technique?
DOCTOR: Well, think, man! Who else would make a deliberate attempt to plunge this world into war, using equipment and techniques not even developed on Earth, like this.
BRIGADIER: The Master?
DOCTOR: Otherwise known as Emil Keller!
VOSPER: Move.
OFFICER: Okay! I'm going down the stairs!
VOSPER: Harry.
MAILER: No trouble.
SUMMERS: Look Governor, you've got to negotiate.
GOVERNOR: I'm sorry, Doctor. It's out of the question.
SUMMERS: But you're risking innocent lives!
GOVERNOR: Oh look, supposing I do turn Mailer loose and those thugs of his with him? They'd kill anyone who came in their way. How many innocent lives do you think I'd be risking then?
POWERS: I've done everything I can, Doctor. B wing's sealed off. If they get the slightest chance, my men'll rush the block.
SUMMERS: And if they don't?
GOVERNOR: We'll wait it out. Mailer's not stupid. He knows he can't hold out forever. Once he realises he can't bluff me.
SUMMERS: But Mailer isn't bluffing! Listen!
POWERS: If you'll excuse me, sir, I'll just
GOVERNOR: Right, Chief.
SUMMERS: And what about Jo Grant?
GOVERNOR: Miss Grant is a member of UNIT. She came here on duty.
SUMMERS: But that makes no difference!
GOVERNOR: However I will inform her headquarters. Inspector?
BRIGADIER: Well, Doctor? What am I to do with her?
DOCTOR: Well, let her go, of course. Well, she's not a criminal. Anyway, she can't do any more harm now that I've got this.
BRIGADIER: Lethbridge Stewart? Yes, Inspector. What? Yes, I see. There's been trouble at Stangmoor.
DOCTOR: Is Jo all right?
BRIGADIER: Yes? Yes, I see. Thank you for letting me know.
DOCTOR: Well?
BRIGADIER: Miss Grant's been captured. She's being held hostage.
VOSPER: This is your last chance, Governor. You don't let us go, you're going to get it!
MAILER: And that includes the girl. Don't forget that!
POWERS: The prisoner's are getting very noisy, sir. Threatening all the hostages.
SUMMERS: Victor, you must talk to them.
GOVERNOR: Aye, you're right. This is a deadlock. Maybe I can make Mailer see some sense. Come on.
MAILER: Going bad enough for you, darling.
JO: And for you.
VOSPER: Harry, the Governor's on his way over.
MAILER: Well, let him in.
VOSPER: Eh?
MAILER: Well, I'm not going out there now, am I? Anyway, it's not .
VOSPER: Right. Locke, open the door. Let the Governor in. What's the next? Look!
MAILER: Barnham!
VOSPER: He must have come from the hospital.
BARNHAM: I, I, I'm looking for Doctor Summers. Has anybody seen Doctor Summers?
MAILER: Here.
VOSPER: What?
MAILER: Get him out of here. He gives me the creeps.
VOSPER: Right. Come on, mate.
JO: Quick! Hide!
JO: All right, you, come on. On your feet. Up!
JO: Here you are, Governor. He's all yours.
GOVERNOR: Now, look.
GOVERNOR: Yes?
POWERS: Professor Keller, sir.
GOVERNOR: All right, Mister Green.
GREEN: Sir.
GOVERNOR: So, there you are, Professor.
MASTER: A pleasure to see you again, Governor.
GOVERNOR: Aye, well to tell the truth, I'm not at all sure I can return the compliment.
MASTER: I'm very sorry to hear that. Why?
POWERS: Shall I?
MASTER: Oh, thank you.
GOVERNOR: Aye, there's been nothing but trouble ever since that machine of yours was installed.
MASTER: Well, there are bound to be teething troubles. I can soon take care of them.
GOVERNOR: You really think you can get things back to normal.
MASTER: Yes Governor, I'm sure of it.
GOVERNOR: Well.
MASTER: It just needs an adjustment here and there, that's all.
GOVERNOR: Aye, I hope you can. We've even got UNIT investigating.
MASTER: UNIT, really.
GOVERNOR: Yes. Their scientific advisor is on his way down here now.
MASTER: I don't think we need to trouble him. As a matter of fact, I've brought my equipment with me.
GOVERNOR: Well, let me take you to the process theatre.
MASTER: There is one thing before we go there. I understand that the man who led the riot was next in line for processing.
GOVERNOR: That's right. Harry Mailer.
MASTER: Well first, I'd like to see him, if I may.
POWERS: All right, Johnson. Samuels.
OFFICER: Sir.
POWERS: We'll be right outside, Mailer, so watch yourself.
GOVERNOR: Let us know when you've finished, Professor Keller.
MASTER: Right.
MAILER: He said Keller. You're the bloke who invented the machine. Pushing your luck, ain't you?
MASTER: Maybe I am.
MAILER: Now listen.
MASTER: Shut up, Mailer, and keep your voice down. I've come here to help you.
MAILER: Help me?
MASTER: You want to get out of here, don't you?
MAILER: I've tried, mate.
MASTER: Yes, I heard about that pathetic little attempt. It was bound to fail. No proper plan and what's more, no resources.
MAILER: What's your game?
MASTER: You and I, Mailer, are going to create a great deal of havoc in this place.
MAILER: Oh yeah? You and me both.
MASTER: No, not exactly. We have a powerful ally.
POWERS: Keep it quiet in here.
POWERS: It's starting up again, sir.
GOVERNOR: They probably think we're going to process Mailer. Stay here, will you?
POWERS: Keep it quiet, will you?
MASTER: Now, you'll find more like these in the boot of my car. Remember, you are responsible for the main gate. Now, from the outside, I want this prison to appear to be running quite smoothly. I'm expecting a visitor. All right? Over there.
MASTER: I've finished in here, thank you. Would you open up, please?
BARNHAM: It's your go.
JO: Oh no, not again.
SUMMERS: I'd best see what's happening.
BARNHAM: Oh, what? 
JO: It's all right, Barnham. Sit down. Everything's okay.
MASTER: Now listen to me, all of you! Don't try to come out until the gas is clear. Stay where you are! Get down on the floor!
SUMMERS: What the devil was that?
JO: Look, I think we'd better get out of here.
VOSPER: There's no escape this time, darling. We've taken over the whole prison.
MASTER: Right, Doctor. Now I'm ready for you.
DOCTOR: Yes?
MAN: Pass, please.
DOCTOR: Passes. Television.
MAN : Pass checked and satisfactory.
MASTER: Show him in, please.
MAN : Open the gates. Let him in.
DOCTOR: Don't point that thing at me, man. It might go off! I'm here on official business. I understand there's been some trouble here.
MAILER: That's right, mate, and you're in it. Now, let's get this heap inside.
DOCTOR: I was going there anyway.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, I thought as much.
MASTER: Right, Vosper, Mailer.
MASTER: You don't seem at all surprised.
DOCTOR: Hardly. How's the riot going?
MASTER: Oh, long since over. I control the prison now.
DOCTOR: Do you? And, er, where is Miss Grant to be found?
MASTER: Reclining in one of our best cells.
DOCTOR: Is she indeed. Well, let me tell you this, that if you harm so much as one hair of her head, I'll
MASTER: You'll do nothing, or I'll put a bullet through both your hearts.
DOCTOR: Why the delay? I take it that I'm to be killed eventually?
MASTER: Oh, eventually, yes. But unfortunately, I find I need your help.
DOCTOR: You want me to help you with that machine of yours. Professor Keller. You want to be careful of that thing, you know. One day it's going to end up killing you.
MASTER: Oh, it won't harm me. I created it.
DOCTOR: Huh!
MASTER: But recently I must admit that it has developed a mind of its own. Hence my need for your assistance while I'm engaged on other business.
DOCTOR: Oh? What other business?
MASTER: Your UNIT friends are transporting their nuclear missile. I intend to take it away from them.
YATES: Yes, sir. We do plan on driving through the night. In that way we should be back on schedule, according to my estimation, by about midday tomorrow.
BRIGADIER: All right, Yates, good luck. Keep HQ informed of your movements. I'll be in contact tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: Well, it's a lunatic scheme. Still, that's only to be expected.
MASTER: Oh, come, Doctor, how can I possibly fail? I launch the missile and wipe out the peace conference, the world is at war.
DOCTOR: I see.
JO: I'm sure I heard gunfire.
SUMMERS: Perhaps there are still some officers holding out.
JO: Or else the Doctor's come down.
DOCTOR: Jo? Jo, where are you?
JO: Doctor! Doctor, we're in here!
DOCTOR : Right, I'm coming!
MASTER: Hold it, Mailer! Let me have that gun. I think you'd better show our patient into the chair, Mailer, and handcuff him into it.
DOCTOR: May I ask the purpose of this charade?
MASTER: Certainly. You'd better wait outside, Mailer.
MASTER: As you see, I have affected the necessary repairs. But before I let you control this machine for me, which I fully intend that you shall, it'll be very interesting to see exactly how long you can hold out against it. Now somewhere, you have, er. Ah-ha.
MASTER: Now this little device, as you know, transmits and amplifies the power of the machine. What you may not know is that it can be adjusted to turn that power against the wearer, like this.
DOCTOR: You know, this is all very tiresome.
MASTER: Is it? Oh, I really would like to stop and watch your nightmares.
DOCTOR: Then why don't you?
MASTER: I have other business as you know. Will you excuse me?
DALEK : Destroy! Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!
Episode Four
MAILER: Is he dead?
MASTER: No, not quite. Wait outside.
JO: I know! We can
SUMMERS: Get back.
VOSPER: All right, you. You're being transferred.
SUMMERS: What about Miss Grant?
VOSPER: Luxury suite, all to herself.
SUMMERS: Look, if Miss Grant stays, so do I. I
VOSPER: Charlie, take him.
SUMMERS: I'm not leaving here without her! 
VOSPER: Take him out.
SUMMERS: Why don't you take us both back to the medical wing? At least we could do some good there!
JO: What's so special about me?
VOSPER: We're saving you for the machine, ain't we?
MASTER: Wake up! Wake up! Ah. Welcome back. Would it surprise you to know that one of your hearts stopped completely? You were within an inch of dying.
DOCTOR: You wanted. You wanted to know how long I could hold out against that machine. Well, the answer is I can't. Nobody can.
MASTER: Of course you can! If I can control it from that console, then so can you. And you must while I'm not here.
DOCTOR: No, no.
MASTER: Oh, come on, Doctor. We are both Time Lords.
DOCTOR: Be that as it may, I know the secret of that machine. Inside is a creature that feeds on the evil of the mind, and very soon it'll feed on yours.
MASTER: Nonsense! Mailer!
MASTER: Release him. And then put him in the cell with Miss Grant. Now listen, Doctor, if you don't do what I ask of you, Miss Grant will be next in line for the process. You just remember that. Right, take him out.
MAILER: Come on, Doc. On your feet! Up!
MAILER: Come on, up you come.
MAILER : Come on, Doc, your feet are dragging! Now come on, help me.
JO: Doctor! Doctor, is that you?
MAILER: Down. Move! Move! Move!
VOSPER: No, you don't! Back!
MASTER: Mailer! I want the Doctor in one piece. Now put him in the cell as I told you.
MAILER: Come on, open this door!
VOSPER: Yeah.
MASTER: Good evening, Miss Grant. What a great pleasure it is to see you again.
JO: The Master! What are you doing here?
MASTER: Oh, the Doctor will tell you about it when he's recovered.
JO: What have you been doing to him?
MASTER: Nothing. Just a little persuasion.
JO: No.
MASTER: Do try and make him see sense, my dear, for your sake. Goodnight.
MAILER : If you've got any sense, just hand him over to me and the boys for an hour. We'll soften him up.
MASTER : Mailer, all you will do is kill him. I don't want that.
MASTER: I want an armed man outside this cell the whole time.
VOSPER: Right, I'll do it myself.
MASTER: Mailer, I want the whole B wing cleared except for these two in here.
MAILER: What the hell for?
MASTER: Don't argue, Mailer, do it. Then meet me in the Governor's office when it's finished.
MAILER: Yes. Sir.
MAILER : You hang on here, Len, yeah?
VOSPER: Yeah, I'll be here.
JO: Hey! Hey, you out there! Listen to me! We need help urgently.
VOSPER: Go to sleep, darling.
JO: Look, open this door. Please, open this door!
VOSPER: A proper little Miss Nightingale, ain't you?
JO: Look at him. He needs a doctor.
VOSPER: Pity.
JO: Help me! Well, at least help me get him up onto the bed.
MASTER: You can't harm me. I'm stronger than you are.
MASTER: I brought you here. I gave you the minds you need to feed on! You are my servant! You are my servant! I
MASTER: No! No! You can't destroy me! I am too strong for you! I am too strong for you!
MASTER: No more minds for you to feed on. Let's see how long starvation takes to bring you to heel.
SUMMERS: It's extraordinary. Quite extraordinary. His physical make-up, it's just not human.
JO: But what's the matter with him?
SUMMERS: He's been beaten up, of course, physically and mentally. His whole system's suffered a tremendous shock. He's in some kind of a coma, but I
JO: Can't you do anything for him?
SUMMERS: I very much doubt it. You could try giving him one of these, if he recovers consciousness.
SUMMERS:  Listen, Jo, who organised this break?
VOSPER: Right, Doc, time's up. What's the verdict? He done for?
SUMMERS: Not quite. Though it's no thanks to you.
VOSPER: Come on, Doc. Don't forget to send in your bill. Charlie?
SUMMERS: Take care, hmm?
JO: And you.
JO: Doctor? Doctor, take one of these. Come on. Come on, just try.
DOCTOR: That's wrong, wrong metabolism. It'd probably kill me, Jo. I'm all right. I'm all right, Jo. Just, just let me rest. Let me rest.
JO: Doctor. Please.
MAILER: All right, fixed that. Here, you all right?
MASTER: Yes, yes, of course, of course.
MAILER: You don't look any too good to me.
MASTER: Mailer, I want a guard on that process room the whole time. No one's to go near that machine. No one.
MAILER: I don't think any of my lot are likely to.
MASTER: Yes, I know, but morbid curiosity can be very strong. See to it, will you? Mailer! Mailer, you've done very well. I'm pleased with you.
MAILER: Good. Then, er, perhaps you'd like to do something for me?
MASTER: Why, certainly. Anything.
MAILER: Perhaps you'd like to tell me why the hell we don't get out of here before it gets light.
MASTER: My dear Mailer, you are just not thinking. A great gang of armed convicts roaming round the countryside?
MAILER: If we can get our civvies back, there's cars outside.
MASTER: Yes, maybe. But have you thought that as well as the police, you'd have the army against you?
MASTER: Dogs, troops, helicopters. Heh! By morning, you'd all be captured or killed.
MAILER: Yeah, all right. So, you've got a better idea?
MASTER: I think so, yes. How would you like a free pardon, unlimited money and a ticket to anywhere in the world?
MAILER: How would I like it? Do me a favour.
MASTER: Right, pay attention. I'll show you how to get it. Now, that is Thunderbolt. It's a gas missile, nuclear powered and British, of course.
MAILER: Of course.
MASTER: The most important thing is that it's illegal, because gas warfare's been outlawed for many years. Therefore the British government are going to dump that in the sea. Now, tomorrow morning, that missile, with a very small escort, will pass within a few miles of this prison.
MAILER: I see, and you'd like me to hijack it?
MASTER: Right first time.
MAILER: Eh?
MASTER: I'm going to aim that at the peace conference in London.
MAILER: You've got to be joking.
MASTER: I am not joking. You look at this map. Now, here's the prison, and this is where you will ambush the convoy.
JO: Doctor? Doctor?
VOSPER: Morning. Oh, he's still with us then.
JO: Sorry you're disappointed.
VOSPER: You watch your tongue.
JO: How about some breakfast?
VOSPER: What do you think this is, a holiday camp?
JO: You weren't told to starve us to death. What good do you think he's going to be to the Master is he doesn't have any food inside him!
VOSPER: All right, all right. Charlie!
CHARLIE : Yeah?
VOSPER: Nip down the kitchens, get some grub for these two.
CHARLIE: Right.
VOSPER: Though by the look of him I don't think he's going to need it.
DOCTOR: Well done, my dear. Now perhaps we can do something about getting out of here.
MASTER: Remember, if you're successful, this will be your passport to freedom. Anywhere! All right, good luck to you.
MAILER: Everybody got the picture? All right then, let's go. Now come along, move!
VOSPER:  Here's your grub then. I'll watch the door, Charlie.
JO: I thought that was meant to be for us?
CHARLIE: It's all right, there's
JO: Thanks.
VOSPER : Charlie? Charlie, what's the matter?
VOSPER: What the devil's going on here?
JO: Really, Doctor, for someone who was on death's door.
DOCTOR: I do have remarkable powers of recovery, don't I? Come on!
JO: They seem to be setting up some kind of search party.
DOCTOR: They'll be expecting us to try and make a break for it.
JO: Well, aren't we?
DOCTOR: No, not while they're all chasing around. Let them cool off for a bit. We'll try again later.
JO: Telephone. There must be a telephone here somewhere.
DOCTOR: There is, but it's locked.
DOCTOR: In any case, it'll be manned by convicts.
JO: What's that?
DOCTOR: That, my dear Jo, is the Thunderbolt. Captain Yates is escorting it. I hope.
JO: What's it got to do with the Master?
DOCTOR: Everything. He's hoping to steal it.
MAILER: Get down!
MAILER: Right, now don't forget. Wait till they get level before you let them have it.
PRISONER: Here they come.
YATES: Venus to Jupiter, Venus to Jupiter. Convoy under armed attack. Estimated position
BRIGADIER: Jupiter to Venus. Jupiter to Venus, give us your position. I say again, give us your position! Over.
BRIGADIER: Right.
YATES: Venus to Jupiter. Do you read me? Over.
YATES: Venus to Jupiter, do you read me? Over.
BRIGADIER: The last time he checked in, he was here. Now, given the average speed of the convoy and the time of the emergency call, the ambush should have taken place about here. I want a chopper standing by to take me down there as soon as possible.
BELL: I'll get on to it right away, sir.
BRIGADIER: And I'll need a mobile HQ and a full forensic team in the area.
BELL: Extension three four. Shall I ask for police and army co-operation, sir?
BRIGADIER: No, UNIT personnel only. This missile isn't supposed to exist. Keep trying to get through to Captain Yates.
BELL: Right sir.
BELL: Jupiter to Venus. Jupiter to Venus. Do you read me? Over.
MAILER: All right, let's get these doors open. Come on.
MAILER: Come on. In!
BRIGADIER: Is that all you can tell me?
BENTON: It happened so quickly, sir.
BRIGADIER: Did you see what happened to Captain Yates?
BENTON: I thought they'd got him.
BRIGADIER: Not unless they took the body with them. One of the bikes is missing.
BENTON: Well, maybe he followed them, sir.
BRIGADIER: Yes, maybe. Right, thanks.
BENTON: There's just one thing, sir.
BRIGADIER: Well?
BENTON: Just before I passed out, I could have sworn I saw a plain black van. The sort the police use. A black Maria.
BRIGADIER: Map! Thank you. Stangmoor prison.
BENTON: What, sir?
BRIGADIER: Well, where else would you get a Black Maria?
JO: Doctor, we can just go on sitting here.
DOCTOR: Why not? It's the safest place at the moment. They'll never think of looking for us here. Besides, I need more time to think. I've got to find out a way of dealing with that alien creature out there.
JO: What alien creature?
DOCTOR: The one inside the Keller machine.
JO: Do you really believe there's something alive in there?
DOCTOR: I do.
JO: Well, what is it?
DOCTOR: It's a sort of mind parasite that feeds on evil. The deadliest threat to mankind since the beginning of time.
JO: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: The Master. He seems to be leaving.
DOCTOR: Right. Now's our chance.
JO: We'll slip out by the hospital and through the rear courtyard.
DOCTOR: I didn't mean our chance to escape, Jo. I meant our chance to get into that process chamber and deal with that machine once and for all.
DOCTOR: No, thank you. You were trained to use those things. They only make me nervous.
JO: His face! He looks terrified, just like the others.
DOCTOR: Perhaps the creature's learned to move. Come on.
JO: You were right. It's gone!
DOCTOR: Yes.
MAILER: All right, girl, drop it! You heard me. I said drop it.
MAILER: Clever girl. As for you, we've had enough of you.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, before you pull that trigger, I
MAILER: What's the matter with you?
DOCTOR: Look, look behind you.
MAILER: I've heard that one before.
DOCTOR: Look behind you!
Episode Five
JO: What happened? Why did it just disappear?
DOCTOR: Well, we couldn't have tempted its appetite.
JO: Why not?
DOCTOR: Well, I imagine it detected a higher concentration of evil in Mailer. There's something to be said for a pure mind, after all, eh, Jo?
JO: Look, I think we'd better get out of here before it gets back!
DOCTOR: Yes, all right, Jo! Jo! Wait a minute. Wait.
JO: Barnham! What are you doing here?
BARNHAM: Well, I was looking for you. I heard this noise and
JO: It's all right. We're going to try and escape.
BARNHAM: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Look, we've got to stop the Master from launching that missile. Now come on, Barnham, you come with us.
JO: Come on. Quickly! Come on!
BRIGADIER: Windmill three four seven
BRIGADIER : To Trap One. How do you read me? Over.
COSWORTH: Acknowledge that, will you, Sergeant? Trap One to Windmill three four seven. Major Cosworth reading you loud and clear. Any results? Over.
BRIGADIER : I'm over Stangmoor Prison now. No sign of the missile. Everything seems quiet and normal. Over.
COSWORTH: Are you going to land? Over.
BRIGADIER : No, I don't think so. I know I said it seems normal but I'm quite sure it's not. I'll continuing reccying for the moment. Over and out.
DOCTOR: Well, there doesn't seem to be anybody about. Let's take a look outside.  You wait here for a minute.
JO: Hey, look! It's the UNIT helicopter! Hey!
PRISONER: All right, you two. Inside!
PRISONER: Move!
BARNHAM: Don't hurt them.
PRISONER: Leave off, Barnham. I said move.
BARNHAM: I said don't hurt them.
PRISONER: No, no, Barnham.
DOCTOR: Let him go. Let him go!
DOCTOR: Come on, let's get out of here.
BARNHAM: But they were trying to
MAILER: What the hell do you mean, we loused things up? You got your missile, didn't you?
MASTER: You left one of the UNIT people alive and he followed you here. Fortunately, he was caught.
MAILER : Look, I don't care about him. I want you back here right away!
MASTER: That's quite impossible. I'm far too busy preparing the missile for launching.
MAILER: Look, mate, I don't care how busy you are. I want you back. That machine of yours has broken out. It's wandering around the prison. It's killed Lenny Vosper. It's nearly killed me!
MASTER: That's impossible, I can't leave here now.
MAILER: Now listen. My mob's not staying on here while that thing's on the loose. They'll start running and I'll be running with them.
MASTER: But you can't! You'll be caught!
MAILER : Maybe. But just remember
MAILER: If I get caught, so do you. They'll want to know where that missile is and I might just tell them. Now think about it!
  
MASTER: I see. All right, Mailer. I'll come back.
MAILER : That's more like it.
MASTER: All right, Captain. You can stop pretending to be unconscious now.
YATES: Why? Why
MASTER: Why did I take the missile? I intend to use it.
YATES: You'll never be able to. It's too complex.
MASTER: Nonsense! This is childishly simple. Anyhow, I have all the technical assistance I need.
YATES: Yes, I was going to ask you. About those soldiers.
MASTER: Hired mercenaries in fake uniforms. Everything's a question of money nowadays, my dear Captain. Will you excuse me? Oh, by the way, you're probably wondering why you're still alive.
YATES: It did cross my mind.
MASTER: Well, in the event, in the highly unlikely event of UNIT finding us before the missile's ready, you'd make a very useful hostage. Remember that.
FULLER: Right, come on.
MAILER: Where did you find them?
FULLER: Outside B wing, waving to a helicopter.
MAILER: You what? Did it see them?
FULLER: Nah, I don't think so. Anyway, it's cleared off now.
MAILER: Get that zombie out of here. Get rid of him!
MAILER: I don't know what we're going to do about you.
DOCTOR: Look, Mailer, what
MAILER: Back off.
DOCTOR: Mailer, why are you helping the Master?
MAILER: Helping who?
DOCTOR: The Ma, er, er, Keller or whatever he calls himself.
MAILER: Simple. I'm helping him because he's helping me.
DOCTOR: Oh, what's he promised you?
MAILER: Money, pardon, ticket to anywhere I like.
DOCTOR: Do you really think he's going to keep those promises?
MAILER: Why not?
JO: He doesn't care whether you live or die. He's just using you.
MAILER: So he's using me, I'm using him. You make me a better offer?
DOCTOR: Let us go and I'll do the best I can for you.
MAILER: Well, if that's the best you can do, Doc, it really ain't good enough. Now, wheel 'em out.
FULLER: Right, come on.
BRIGADIER: I know exactly where that missile is. Here.
COSWORTH: Stangmoor Prison, sir?
BRIGADIER: It all adds up. Benton saw a Black Maria when the missile was ambushed and I saw the Doctor and Miss Grant. I'm convinced the Master has taken over the prison to be used as a hideout for that missile.
COSWORTH: Then I assume we'll be taking the place, sir. I'll draw up an assault plan.
BRIGADIER : Major Cosworth?
COSWORTH: Sir?
BRIGADIER: Have you seen Stangmoor Prison?
COSWORTH: No, sir.
BRIGADIER: Well, I've just been looking at it. It's an old fortress. You'd need an army to get in there.
COSWORTH: A fortress?
BRIGADIER: That's right.
COSWORTH: I suppose there couldn't possible be a secret underground passage or something?
BRIGADIER: Good, Major, good. Is that a map of the prison?
COSWORTH: Yes, sir.
BRIGADIER: Yes, you're right. It hasn't been blocked off either. It probably leads to the old dungeons.
COSWORTH: It's rather like making a film, isn't it, sir.
SOLDIER : Greyhound seven to Trap One. Greyhound seven to Trap One.
COSWORTH: Excuse me, sir.
COSWORTH: It's all right, I'll take it. Go ahead, Greyhound seven.
SOLDIER : A black saloon car has just entered the prison gates. Over.
COSWORTH: Thank you, Greyhound seven. Maintain surveillance. Over and out.
BRIGADIER: It must be the Master. They wouldn't let anyone else inside. Right, that settles it! We're going to take that prison.
COSWORTH: By using the underground passage?
BRIGADIER: Yes. And also by using a Trojan Horse.
MASTER : I must say, you've taken your time about it.
MAILER : Yes
MAILER: Any trouble?
FULLER: Not a squeak out of them.
MASTER: All right. Open up, Fuller.
MASTER: Doctor, I
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush. 
DOCTOR: There.
MASTER: Doctor, I
JO: Shush.
JO: There.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the trouble with this game is that it's too simple. In any case, I'm more used to playing three dimensional chess.
MASTER: All right, I've allowed you your little gesture. Now perhaps we can talk seriously.
DOCTOR: I suppose you're going to ask me to control that machine of yours again.
MASTER: I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I can't. I've told you before. Nobody can.
MASTER: You underestimate yourself, Doctor. You are perfectly capable of controlling it. For a time, at least.
DOCTOR: Well, even if I could, why should I help you?
MASTER: To save lives. Several people have died already.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Most of them hard cases that were helping you.
MASTER: Very well, then. To save one life.
DOCTOR: My own?
JO: Don't listen to him, Doctor. He's just bluffing.
MASTER: Am I? Unless the Doctor does what I ask, Miss Grant, Mailer will shoot you here and now.
DOCTOR: Well, it's only a theory, but I think there may be one way to inhibit that machine's power of movement.
MASTER: And now is your chance to put that theory to the test.
DOCTOR: Well where's the thing now? Still wandering about?
MAILER: Gone back to the process chamber.
MASTER: Temporarily glutted, no doubt.
DOCTOR: Well, I shall need a lot of equipment, you know.
MASTER: Oh, Stangmoor Prison's a very progressive place. The entire contents of the workshop's at your disposal.
DOCTOR: All right, I'll give it a try.
MASTER: Good. All right, Fuller. Let us out, will you? No, Miss Grant. You will stay here as a guarantee of the Doctor's good behaviour. After you, Doctor. Satisfied, Mailer?
BRIGADIER: Now we shall, as you realise, be very considerably outnumbered. However, not all of our opponents will be armed and none of them will be trained soldiers.
COSWORTH: And, of course, we shall have surprise on our side.
BRIGADIER: Exactly. Any questions?
COSWORTH: No, sir.
BRIGADIER: Right, carry on.
COSWORTH: An excellent plan, if I may say so, sir. A very good chance of success.
BRIGADIER: Thank you, Major Cosworth. I'm very relieved to hear that.
BRIGADIER: Yes?
BENTON: Excuse me, sir.
BRIGADIER: Benton? What the devil are you doing here? You're supposed to be in hospital.
BENTON: Well, yes, sir. I discharged myself. I'm all right now. I've just got a bit of a sore head.
COSWORTH: I'll just get on, sir.
BRIGADIER: At ease, Sergeant. Well, what do you want?
BENTON: I'd like to come on the assault, sir.
BRIGADIER: Benton, you're supposed to be suffering from severe concussion.
BENTON: I know, sir, but it's only a scratch, honest. And you said yourself, I've got a thick skull. Anyway, I'd like a chance to get at the blokes who did it.
BRIGADIER: All right. If you feel fit, you can take charge of the underground assault party. Major Cosworth will put you in the picture.
BENTON: Thank you, sir. Sir, I
BRIGADIER: Yes?
BENTON: Well, I wondered if you'd had any news about Captain Yates, sir.
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, Benton, there's nothing. Nothing at all.
MASTER: Look, Doctor, you must hurry! If that thing in there starts moving again
DOCTOR: I'm well aware of the urgency of the situation, thank you. Right. Excuse me, will you?
MASTER: Oh.
DOCTOR: Would you mind bringing that plug with you, please?
MASTER: Oh, right.
DOCTOR: And the coil.
MASTER: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
MASTER: Look, tell me, what precisely do you intend to do?
DOCTOR: I'm going to try throwing this coil over that machine in there. If I can get close enough to it without being killed, that is.
MASTER: I see. Well, what can I do to help.
DOCTOR: Well, I want you to operate these controls here and switch on to full power when I call out.
MASTER: This is very ingenious.
DOCTOR: If all goes well, it should set up an electric current in the coil alternating on much the same frequency as the beta rhythms of the human brain.
MASTER: And you think that'll deal with it?
DOCTOR: I don't know, but I think it'll confuse the creature enough to take away its power of movement anyway.
MASTER: Well, I hope you are right.
DOCTOR: So do I.
DOCTOR: Now switch it on now, will you? Bottom one.
MASTER: Right. Well, good luck to you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Right, you know what to do.
MASTER: Yes.
DALEK : Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Exterminate!
DOCTOR: Now!
DALEK: Annihilate!
DOCTOR: Now!
MASTER: Mailer. Mailer? Well, Doctor. Congratulations.
DOCTOR: It won't hold it for long, you know. That thing's intelligent. Soon it'll work out what happened and find a way to deal with it.
MASTER: Then you'll have to think up something better, won't you. Now take the Doctor back to his cell, Mailer.
MAILER: Let's go.
JO: You all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Jo. I'm fine, I'm fine.
JO: Did you fix the machine?
DOCTOR: Yes, temporarily.
JO: You look tired.
DOCTOR: I am. Physically and mentally.
JO: Hey, how about some food? Do you think they'd let us have any?
DOCTOR: I doubt it. Not after what happened last time.
JO: I've had nothing to eat all day. I'm starving.
DOCTOR: Well, we shouldn't have thrown our breakfast at them, should we?
JO: Breakfast! Hey, wait a minute. I knew they wouldn't bother to clear up. Here you are.
DOCTOR: Oh, no thanks, Jo, you have it. I'll do without food for a while.
JO: No, we'll share it. And there's some water in the jug over here.
DOCTOR: Oh, all right. Cheers.
JO: Cheers.
DOCTOR: Huh. Did I ever tell you about the time I was in the Tower of London?
JO: No?
DOCTOR: No?
JO: No.
DOCTOR: Well, I shared a cell with a very strange chap called Raleigh.
JO: Raleigh?
DOCTOR: Yeah, Sir Walter Raleigh.
JO: Oh.
DOCTOR: He got into some trouble with Queen Elizabeth. Elizabeth the first, that is. He kept going on about this new vegetable of his he'd discovered, you see, called the potato. One day, he sat down, pointed a finger at me
BRIGADIER: Morning, mate. Provisions.
PRISONER: What?
BRIGADIER: Provisions. Nosh. Food.
PRISONER: Back gate. You leave it at the inner gate. You can't come in here.
BRIGADIER: Oh, it won't get in there, mate. Me van's too big.
PRISONER: You'll have to clear off then.
BRIGADIER: 'Ere, wait a minute. I've got a weeks supply of food in there, and booze for the Governor. Am I supposed to go back and tell them you don't want it? They'll think you're barmy.
PRISONER: Hang about.  Main gate here. I've got a big provisions lorry. Do I let it in?
MAILER : Yeah, okay. But I want him out of here fast.
PRISONER: Drive up the main courtyard. Unload there. We'll give you a hand. The, er, chief wants you out of here quick as possible.
BRIGADIER: Don't worry. Less time I spend in there, the better.
PRISONER: Okay, open up.
BRIGADIER: Come on, out!
BRIGADIER: The back's open.
BRIGADIER: This is Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart of UNIT. This prison is now in military hands.
JO: It seems to be right inside the prison.
DOCTOR: Yes. I only hope they can gain complete control before Mailer starts killing the hostages.
JO: So do I.
DOCTOR: Hmm? Oh, yes.
BRIGADIER: There!
BRIGADIER: Come on! I'm going to find the Doctor!
DOCTOR: Ah, come to give yourself up?
MAILER: Now shut up and listen. You want to stay alive you'll do exactly as I say.
DOCTOR: Well?
MAILER: You're going to help me get out of here. You're going to walk out of here and tell those friends of yours that either I get out or I'm going to chop you down. All right?
JO: They won't listen.
MAILER: Too bad for you if they don't. Come on, move!
MAILER: And remember, no heroics. I can get out with either one of you. Up!
JO: Now, Doctor!
MAILER: That's you finished. I warned you. I only need one of you.
Episode Six
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brigadier. But do you think that for once in your life you could manage to arrive before the nick of time?
BRIGADIER: I'm glad to see you too, Doctor. All right, Miss Grant?
JO: Yes, thanks.
DOCTOR: I see you've changed your job.
BRIGADIER: Yes. Rather an effective disguise, don't you think?
BENTON: Right, down there.
BRIGADIER: Well, did you get the Master?
BENTON: Sorry, sir. He seems to have got away.
DOCTOR: What about the missile?
BENTON: Well, we didn't
BRIGADIER: Isn't it here?
DOCTOR: No.
BRIGADIER: Oh.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, apart from losing the Master and the missile, you're doing very well, Brigadier.
DOCTOR: Look, the Master has got to be found, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: I'm rather more concerned with finding that missile.
DOCTOR: Well, it comes to the same thing, surely.
BENTON: Excuse me, sir?
BRIGADIER: Yes?
BENTON: Everything's secure, sir. The prisoners are back in their cells and we're starting to move the wounded out.
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant Benton.
BENTON: Oh, and we found this chap, sir, hiding in the medical block.
BRIGADIER: Lock him up with the others.
BENTON: Right, sir.
JO: No. No, no, don't. Come on, Barnham.
BENTON: Right, Davies.
JO: Come and sit down.
BARNHAM: I heard, I heard the shooting and I didn't know what to do.
JO: It's all right, it's all over. We'll take care of you. Has he been given anything to eat?
BENTON: Well, no, Miss, we were going
JO: Well, don't just stand there, show me where I can find him something.
BENTON: Yes, Miss. Sorry.
BRIGADIER: Who is this man?
DOCTOR: His name is Barnham. He's the last man to undergo the Keller process and you can see what it's done to him. He's got the mind of a child. Don't worry about him. You leave him to Jo. He trusts her. Right, let's take a look of this map of yours.
YATES : Trap One to Greyhound. Trap One to Greyhound.
DOCTOR: It's Captain Yates.
BRIGADIER: All right, I'll take it. Greyhound to Trap One. Is that you, Yates? Where are you?
YATES: I'm at mobile HQ, sir.
BRIGADIER : What happened?
YATES: Quite a lot. I know where he's got Thunderbolt.
BRIGADIER : Where?
YATES: Outside a hanger on that deserted airfield at Stanham. He's got a crane, launching pad, fake troops, the lot.
BRIGADIER: Are you all right, Yates?
YATES : A bit bashed about, sir, but I might just survive.
BRIGADIER: Right, stay where you are. I'm on my way. Over and out. No need to worry about the Master any more. This time, we've got him.
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant Benton. You'll be in charge of the prison. You can consider yourself Acting Governor.
BENTON: Thank you, sir.
BRIGADIER: Oh, Benton?
BENTON: Yes, sir?
BRIGADIER: Don't get any delusions of grandeur, will you?
BENTON: No, sir.
BRIGADIER: Well, that about wraps it up, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mmm?
BRIGADIER: I said, that about wraps it up.
DOCTOR: Does it?
BRIGADIER: Major Cosworth's throwing a cordon around that hangar now. I'll join him at mobile HQ and then we'll move in and mop things up.
DOCTOR: You may not find the Master all that easy to mop up, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: I don't anticipate much trouble.
DOCTOR: Well, don't forget he's got that rocket full of nerve gas. He can point it at any city in Europe.
BRIGADIER: Don't worry, Doctor. He won't get the chance. You coming with me?
DOCTOR: No, not for the moment. I've got to work out a way of destroying that machine of his. If I can step up the voltage in that coil
BRIGADIER: Yes, well, er, I'll leave the machine to you, and you can leave Master to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, all right.
DAVE: Have you looked out here then, Bill?
BILL: Yes, Dave, I have.
DAVE: Oh no!
BILL: No!
DAVE: No, the pain. Please!
JO: Here you are, Barnham. Drink this up while it's hot.
BARNHAM: Thank you very much, Miss.
JO: Sergeant Benton will look after you. Won't you, Sergeant?
DOCTOR: Right, that's it. That should just about do it, I think.
JO: Wait for me!
BENTON: Sergeant, Acting Governor Benton here.
SUMMERS : It's Doctor Summers, Sergeant. I wondered if those medical supplies had arrived yet.
BENTON: Medical supplies? Hang on, Doctor Summers, I'll check.
BENTON: What do you think you're doing?
BARNHAM: Doctor Summers.
BENTON: You what?
BARNHAM: Well, I'd like to talk to Doctor Summers.
BENTON: Look, you go off and talk to who you like, okay?
BENTON: Hello, Doctor Summers. Yes, they seem to be here all right. They should be on their way over to you now.
DOCTOR: Oh my! The thing's escaped again!
JO: How?
DOCTOR: Well, it must stored up its energy and blown all the circuits. Let's have a look.
JO: Be careful.
JO: What happened?
DOCTOR: Well, it's stronger than ever now. How on earth am I going to stop it?
JO: Will you be able to set the coils up again?
DOCTOR: No, that'd never work twice. The thing's too intelligent. In any case, I doubt whether I'd get near enough to it without being killed.
BARNHAM: What's wrong?
DOCTOR: Barnham, get out of here! Get back!
BARNHAM: I heard this noise. I was
JO: It's stopped.
BARNHAM: Machine. I remember this place. Something happened here.
BARNHAM: Something terrible!
DOCTOR: Barnham, come back! Come back! Come back!
BARNHAM: No!
DOCTOR: Over here!
BARNHAM: No!
DOCTOR: Don't be frightened by it! Don't be frightened. That's it, that's it. As long as you're here, it won't hurt us. Right, stay there. Stay there. Sit yourself down, that's it.
JO: But I don't understand.
DOCTOR: The mind of evil, Jo. I should have realised. That creature feeds on the evil impulses of the brain.
JO: And Barnham hasn't got any.
DOCTOR: No, the machine extracted them all. Something in his mind acts as a screen and neutralises it. So long as he's here, we're perfectly safe.
YATES: Afternoon, sir.
COSWORTH: Afternoon, sir.
BRIGADIER: Afternoon. How are you, Yates?
YATES: Recovering rapidly, sir.
BRIGADIER: Good. Sit down.
YATES: Thank you, sir.
BRIGADIER: Well, how's it going, Major Cosworth?
COSWORTH: Fine, sir. I've just been on to the Ministry of Defence.
BRIGADIER: And?
COSWORTH: Thunderbolt is equipped with an abort mechanism. Once in go condition, it can be blown up at any time.
BRIGADIER: So, if the Master threatens to launch the missile, we simply blow it up on the ground from here.
JO:  Can't you kill it now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No. No, these creatures are incredibly resilient, Jo. It'd take an atomic explosion or an enormous charge of electricity to destroy that.
JO: So what are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm going to see. I'm going to see Sergeant Benton. Will you wait here? Will you be all right until I get back?
BARNHAM: I'm scared. It's evil.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. I'll be as quick as I possibly can, all right? Now, Jo will look after you.
JO: What's your other name?
DOCTOR: Now, are you sure you've got all that?
BENTON: I think so, Doctor. Extra heavy duty cable, arrangements with the National Complex for a maximum power boost. I'll get onto it right away.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. It's all extremely urgent.
BENTON: It's going to take quite a bit of organising.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm quite sure it is, but neverthe
BENTON: Acting Governor Benton here.
MASTER: Who?
BENTON : Stangmoor Prison - Acting Governor Sergeant Benton here.
MASTER: I see. Er, would the Doctor be there by any chance?
BENTON : I'll see, sir. Who's calling, please?
MASTER: Er, just say it's an old friend.
BENTON: It's for you, Doctor. Say's he's an old friend of yours.
DOCTOR: Hello? Yes?
MASTER: Oh, Doctor, do I gather that the tables have turned somewhat at Stangmoor?
DOCTOR: You have gathered correctly.
SUMMERS : Barnham?
SUMMERS: Jo, what on earth do you think you're doing? I told Barnham to stay in the medical wing.
JO: He can't leave. We've got to stay here with that thing.
SUMMERS: But you'll get yourselves killed.
JO: Doctor Summers, we have got to
SUMMERS: Look, Jo! Jo, you know he's not well and that thing's dangerous. I've got to get him back to the medical wing. Now, come on!
JO: No! No, you can't!
SUMMERS: Argh! My head!
JO: Try, Barnham.
SUMMERS: That thing, it's alive!
JO: Yes, and if Barnham leaves here, that thing will kill all of us.
DOCTOR: In spite of what I've said, do you still intend to fire that rocket on London?
MASTER: I most certainly do!
DOCTOR : Well, that would start a world war.
MASTER: Exactly! And then later when this planet is in ruins, I shall take over.
DOCTOR: I see. Aren't you forgetting something?
MASTER : Am I, Doctor? What?
DOCTOR: The dematerialisation circuit from your own Tardis.
DOCTOR: You can't leave Earth without that, can you.
MASTER: Are you offering me a deal?
DOCTOR: I am. Hand me back that rocket and I'll return your circuit.
MASTER : That's very generous of you.
DOCTOR: Leave Earth. Stop bothering us. Go somewhere else and be a nuisance elsewhere. Well, what do you say?
DOCTOR: Well?
MASTER : Right!
MASTER: But you will bring that circuit to me here at the hanger. You and you alone. At the first sign of treachery, the first sign of interference from your UNIT friends and I launch the missile immediately.
DOCTOR: Sergeant, can you contact the Brigadier for me?
BENTON: Well, I think so, Doctor. He should be back at mobile HQ by now.
DOCTOR: Get onto him at once. Tell him he's got to cancel that attack.
SUMMERS: You're quite sure there's nothing I can do?
JO: No, honestly.
SUMMERS: All right. Well, I've got a mass of wounded to attend to. I'll be in the medical wing if you need me. Look after him, Jo. And yourself.
JO: Thank you.
SUMMERS: Now, you do exactly what Miss Grant tells you, all right? Good lad.
DOCTOR: But understand that you mustn't go anywhere near him. If he catches sight of a uniform, he'll fire that rocket.
BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Doctor. Leave everything to us. I've cancelled the attack and we'll send a dispatch rider to HQ to get your circuit, just in case.
DOCTOR: What do you mean, just in case? It's our only chance.
BRIGADIER : Oh, I don't know, Doctor. There are other ways of dealing with him.
DOCTOR: Now look, don't do anything stupid, Brigadier. He means what he says, you know.
BRIGADIER: Don't you worry, Doctor. Over and out.
DOCTOR: Lethbridge Stewart!
BENTON: The Brigadier knows what he's doing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I sincerely hope so. I'm going back to Miss Grant.
BRIGADIER: Right, Major Cosworth. I want you to get on to the missile control people. They're to maintain radio link with us and explode the missile when I give the word.
COSWORTH: Right away, sir.
BRIGADIER: Captain Yates, you'll be in charge of the evacuation. I want the area around that hangar completely clear within a ten mile radius.
YATES: Right, sir.
COSWORTH: Trap One to missile control. Report my signal. Over.
JO: But I don't see why you're so upset. If you give him back the circuit and he hands over the missile
DOCTOR: You just don't understand, do you, Jo? Once he gets that circuit back he's free to roam through time and space. We'd never catch him.
JO: Then you'll just have to give in. The Master's got the missile and all we've got is this wretched machine.
DOCTOR: Jo, will you stop stating the obvious. What did you say?
JO: I said all we've got is this machine.
DOCTOR: Well, that's it. That's the answer. We've got the machine and we've got our friend, Barnham.
JO: I don't understand.
DOCTOR: With a little help from you, old chap, we can destroy this machine and the Master at the same time.
MASTER: Just in case somebody tries to be clever.
JO: Don't worry. It can't hurt you.
DOCTOR: Come on, old chap, come on.
JO: It's all right.
DOCTOR: That's it. All right? Now don't forget. Whatever you do, don't drop it. Now hang on to it tight. Pick it up.
DOCTOR: Come on. That's it. Now, mind how you go. Mind how you go. All right? Not too heavy for you? Good, that's it. Now close the doors after us, will you, Sergeant?
BENTON: Right, sir.
DOCTOR: Now mind his feet.
BRIGADIER: We tried to explode Thunderbolt on the ground, Doctor, but nothing happened.
DOCTOR: What did you expect? The Master may be a scoundrel but he is a scientist. He'll have disconnected the abort mechanism.
BRIGADIER: There's only one thing for it, Doctor. We'll have to give him back that wretched circuit.
DOCTOR: Oh, has it arrived?
COSWORTH: Just arrived, sir.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's it.
BRIGADIER: Believe me, Doctor, I hate to see the Master escape unpunished as much as you do.
DOCTOR: It's where he'll escape to that worries me. What right have we got to let his loose on some other planet?
BRIGADIER: Unless you've got some better plan, I can see no alternative.
DOCTOR: My dear Brigadier, of course I have a better plan.
MASTER: Very strange form of transport, Doctor. I hope you're not going to try anything silly.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. No, it's just that Bessie had broken down.
MASTER: Bessie?
DOCTOR: You know, Bessie?
MASTER: Oh, yes!
MASTER: I think I should warn you that my  is aimed and ready to fire. I just have to press the requisite button.
DOCTOR: That's very clever.
DOCTOR: My word, you have done well.
MASTER: Shall we get on with it? Did you bring the circuit with you?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Here.
MASTER: May I examine it, please?
DOCTOR: How do I know that you won't take the circuit and fire the missile anyway?
MASTER: I'm afraid you don't. You'll just have to trust me this once.
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so.
JO: Now, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hai!
JO:  Hello, Brigadier? Jo Grant here. Over.
BRIGADIER : Hello, Miss Grant. We read you. Over.
JO : Doctor working on missile circuit. Stand by for abort instructions. Over.
BRIGADIER : Well done, Miss Grant. Greyhound to Windmill three four two. Come in to land. I say again, come in to land.
PILOT : Wilco.
DOCTOR: Right, Jo!
JO: We're on our way. Over and out.
DOCTOR: Come on!
DOCTOR: He's dead. Come on, Jo. Jo, come on.
COSWORTH: Twenty seconds, missile control.
BRIGADIER: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, abort!
BRIGADIER: Thank you.
JO: We took Barnham there to help us.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jo. I know.
JO: We should never have left him there.
DOCTOR: Well, how do you think I feel?
JO: Sorry.
DOCTOR: Yes. Here, have some coffee.
BRIGADIER: Well, at least we're rid of the Keller machine, and the Master.
DOCTOR: Yes, we've probably killed off that machine all right, but I'm not so sure about the Master.
BRIGADIER: Well, even if he wasn't killed, Doctor, he won't get far if you've still got his circuit.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's true.
DOCTOR: The circuit. I must have lost it in my struggle with him.
BRIGADIER: Probably destroyed in the explosion.
DOCTOR: Yes, but what if it wasn't? Supposing the Master found it?
BENTON: Hello, Governor's office?
MASTER : Put me on to the Doctor, will you?
BENTON: Yes. It's for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The Master? Yes?
MASTER: Ah, Doctor. I was afraid you'd be worried about me, so I thought I'd let you know that I'm alive and well.
DOCTOR: I'm extremely sorry to hear that.
MASTER: I made the safety of my Tardis which, thanks to your generosity, is in perfect working order.
DOCTOR: So, we won't be seeing you for quite some time.
MASTER : Not for quite some time.
MASTER: But one day, I will destroy this miserable planet and you along with it. Goodbye, Doctor. Oh, by the way, enjoy your exile.
JO: What did he say?
DOCTOR: His usual threats.
JO: Never mind, Doctor. You've beaten him.
DOCTOR: Have I, Jo? He's got his Tardis back. He's free to come and go where he pleases, while I'm stuck here on Earth  with you, Brigadier!
