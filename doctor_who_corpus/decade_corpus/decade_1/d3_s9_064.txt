The Time Monster
Episode One
MASTER: Welcome! Welcome to your new Master!
DOCTOR: Jo! Jo! Jo!
DOCTOR: Jo.
JO: Doctor. Doctor. Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Oh. Oh, I must have been dreaming.
JO: I'll say you were. A real pippin of a dream. I've brought you a cup of tea. Do you want it?
DOCTOR: Yes. Volcanoes and earthquakes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I enjoyed that.
JO: Doctor, have you been working all night again? On that? I don't know. What is anyway, a super dematerialisation circuit?
DOCTOR: Oh, no. No, that'll have to wait. No, this is far more important. It might make all the difference the next time he turns up.
JO: The next time who turns up?
DOCTOR: The Master, of course. Jo, now listen to me. I want you to find out as quickly as possible if there have been any volcanic eruptions or severe earthquakes recently. It doesn't matter where. Anywhere in the world.
JO: You're joking, of course.
DOCTOR: Believe me, this is no matter for jokes.
JO: But I read it all out to last night, I. Don't go away.
JO: It just shows you don't listen to a word I say, doesn't it. Now, yes, here we are. New eruptions in the Thera group of islands. Somewhere off Greece.
DOCTOR: Does it say anything about a crystal?
JO: Crystal?
DOCTOR: Mmm.
JO: No, what crystal? Look, I know I'm exceedingly dim, but would you mind explaining? 
DOCTOR: It was in my dream, Jo. There was a large crystal, shaped like a trident.
MASTER:  A simple piece of quartz, nothing more.
RUTH: But Professor Thascales, that is ridiculous.
MASTER: Of course it is, Doctor Ingram. Of course it is.
MASTER: You know, there is no means whereby I could prove to you that that crystal is any different from any other piece of quartz, and yet it is unique. As you say, ridiculous!
RUTH: So, this is the missing piece of equipment we've been waiting for?
MASTER: Exactly.
HYDE: I'll swear I switched that alarm off in my sleep. Oh, sorry, Prof.
RUTH: Simmer down, Stu, for Pete's sake.
MASTER: Please do not call me Prof.
HYDE: In the doghouse again.
MASTER: Now quiet, both of you. Now listen. I have a meeting with the new director in two and a half minutes, so I'm afraid I shall have to leave the final tests for the demonstration to the two of you.
RUTH: But aren't we going to have a trial run, Professor?
MASTER: No, it's not necessary.
HYDE: Well, that's marvellous. We're going to look a right bunch of Charlies if this fellow from the Grants Committee turns up and we're left with egg on our faces.
RUTH: Yes, surely, Professor, it would be very unwise
MASTER: Now look, my dear, there is no need for you to worry your pretty little head.
RUTH: And there's no need for you to be so patronising, Professor. Look, just because I'm a woman, there's no need to treat me like
HYDE: Here we go.
MASTER: No, no, no, I'm sorry, you're quite right, Doctor. Please forgive me. And now, er, would you please run those tests?
RUTH: That man. You know, I don't what infuriates me more. His dictatorial manner or that infernal courtesy of his. It's all the same, really. A bland assumption of male superiority.
HYDE: May God bless the good ship women's lib and all who sail in her.
YATES: There you are, Jo, the Thera group. Those little islands there.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: Come and take a look.
DOCTOR: No, not now, Jo. I'm busy.
JO: But it's the map you asked for.
DOCTOR: Oh?
YATES: There, you see?
DOCTOR: Thera. It doesn't mean a thing to me.
JO: Well, it says Santorini in brackets. Well, that must be another name for it. How about that?
DOCTOR: Oh, let's forget all about it, Jo, shall we? I just had a nightmare, that's all.
JO: Sorry, Mike.
YATES: Better than hanging round the duty room. If nothing turns up soon, I'll go round the twist.
JO: That makes two of us. Here was I, all ready for a nice little trip to Atlantis.
DOCTOR: What?
JO: Well, nothing. I was just saying to Mike
DOCTOR: Yes, I heard what you said, but you said Atlantis. Why Atlantis?
JO: Well, that's what it says in the paper.
DOCTOR: Give me that map, Captain Yates.
JO: Yes, here we are. Believed by many modern historians to be all that remains of Plato's metropolis of Atlantis.
DOCTOR: Of course. Of course.
YATES: Atlantis? I thought that was supposed to be in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?
JO: You're a bit out of date. Apparently it was part of the Minoan civilisation. Oh, you know, the Minotaur and all the Cretan jazz.
YATES: It's only a legend though, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Jo, get me the Brigadier, will you?
JO: What, now?
DOCTOR: Yes, now.
JO: Oh, all right.
YATES: The Brig? Why the Brig, for heaven's sake?
JO: Search me.
JO: Doctor? It's the Brigadier.
DOCTOR: Hello, Brigadier? It's the Doctor here. Now listen to me. I want you to put out a world wide warning. Alert all your precious UNIT HQ's, not that it'll do any good.
BRIGADIER: Thank you very much. And against what precisely am I supposed to be warning the world?
DOCTOR : The Master. I've just seen him.
BRIGADIER:  Seen him? Where? When?
DOCTOR: In a dream. Not half an hour ago.
BRIGADIER: In any case, Doctor, every section of UNIT now has the search for the Master written into standing orders.
DOCTOR: Priority Z one hundred and forty four, I suppose?
BRIGADIER: Priority A one, actually.
DOCTOR: Look, I tell you, Brigadier, there is grave danger.
BRIGADIER: Danger of what, for heavens sake?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure, but in my dream I quite clearly saw
BRIGADIER: You know, if this got out, you'd be the laughing stock of UNIT. A dream. Really, Doctor, you'll be consulting the entrails of a sheep next.
BRIGADIER: Right, we'd better be on our way to the Newton Institute. Ready, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, I can't go anywhere at the moment. I'm far too busy.
BRIGADIER: But I told them you'd be coming. Two observers from UNIT, they said.
JO: Oh, shall I go?
DOCTOR: No, certainly not, Jo. I shall need you here with me.
JO: Well, what's it all about anyway?
BRIGADIER: TOM-TIT, that's what it's all about. A demonstration of TOM-TIT.
YATES: TOM-TIT? What on earth does that stand for?
BRIGADIER: Well, it's the, er, the trans
DOCTOR: Transmission Of Matter Through Interstitial Time.
BRIGADIER: Yes, exactly what I was going to say. TOM-TIT.
JO: Well, what does it do?
BRIGADIER: Oh, it's a brilliant idea. Apparently it can break down solid objects into light-waves or whatever, and transmit them from one place to another.
YATES: And it works?
BRIGADIER: Apparently. Well, Yates, I suppose you'd better come with me.
YATES: Sorry, sir. I'm Duty Officer.
BRIGADIER: Well, someone's got to come.
BENTON: I'm just leaving, sir.
BRIGADIER: Ah, Sergeant Benton. The very man.
BENTON: But I'm just off on a forty eight hour pass, sir.
BRIGADIER: Oh no, you're not, Sergeant. You're coming for a little trip to the Newton Institute.
BENTON: Yes, sir. The where, sir? The Newton Institute?
BRIGADIER: That's right. It's a research establishment at Wootton, just outside Cambridge.
MASTER: A charlatan? How dare you.
PERCIVAL: Doctor Cook is not only chairman of the Grants Committee, but a colleague and a personal friend. Am I to tell him this afternoon that I am as gullible as that drunkard I have replaced? How is it that I can find no trace of your academic career before you visited Athens University, Professor? How is it that you publish nothing? That you refuse to reveal the hypothesis behind your so-called experiment? That the very name of your project is arrogant nonsense! TOM-TIT! What, pray, is interstitial time?
MASTER: You're a very clever man, Director. I can see that I shall have to tell you everything. Oh, yes, you're perfectly right. I am no professor.
PERCIVAL: Ah, say no more.
MASTER: But do please hear me out. I can see that you're very upset.
PERCIVAL: Upset.
MASTER: But there is nothing to worry about. You must believe me. You must believe me. You must believe me.
PERCIVAL: Must believe you.
MASTER: I am the Master. You will listen to me, and you will obey me. You will obey me!
PERCIVAL: Obey. Obey. I will obey.
MASTER: That's better. Now you just sit there quietly and await the arrival of this wretched man from London. And remember you are perfectly satisfied as to the authenticity of my credentials, and the integrity of my work here. You understand?
PERCIVAL: Yes I understand.
RUTH: One point three five nine.
HYDE : One point three five nine, check.
RUTH: Two point oh four five.
HYDE : Two point oh four five, check.
RUTH: Three point oh six two.
HYDE : Three point oh six two, check.
RUTH : Five nine and steady.
HYDE: Five nine and steady. 
RUTH : And that's the lot.
HYDE: And that's the lot. Check, check, check.
RUTH: Now we just stand around and wait.
RUTH: You know, I still think it's just plain stupid not to do a trial run. It's ludicrous.
HYDE: Ludicrous, check.
RUTH: Oh, grow up, Stu.
HYDE: No, but I mean it, love. It is ludicrous. I mean, just suppose this thing won't wag its tail when we tell it to?
RUTH: Well, they withdraw the grant.
HYDE: As sure as God made little green apples, and bang goes my fellowship.
RUTH: Bang goes my job. And my reputation, too, for that matter. Men. It's their conceit that bugs me.
HYDE: Hey, hey, I'm on your side, remember?
RUTH: Oh, you don't count.
HYDE: Oh, don't I? And why not, may I ask?
RUTH: Look, don't bully me, Stu, or I think I'll burst into tears.
HYDE: Let's do it!
RUTH: What?
HYDE: Have a run through.
RUTH: Without him?
HYDE: Well, why not?
RUTH: Well, it is his project. I mean, he's the boss.
HYDE: Nominally. But you think how much you've put into it. It's a joint affair. I reckon you've as much right to take a decision as he has.
RUTH: Well.
HYDE: Course, if you need a man in charge.
RUTH: That does it. We go ahead.
HYDE: That's my girl.
JO: You know, Doctor, you're quite the most infuriating man I've ever met. I've asked you at least a million times, what is it?
DOCTOR: Extraordinary. I could have sworn I'd told you. It's a time sensor.
JO: Oh, I see.
DOCTOR: Do you? Well, what's it do then? 
JO: Well, it, er.
DOCTOR: Mmm hmm?
JO: It, er, detects disturbances in a time field.
DOCTOR: Well done, Jo. You're learning. Exactly what you need if you happen to be looking for a Tardis.
JO: It's a Tardis sniffer-outer.
DOCTOR: Or any other time machine, for that matter. So, if the Master turns up again
JO: Bingo.
DOCTOR: As you so rightly say, Bingo.
HYDE: I feel like the back end of a pantomime horse.
RUTH: Very suitable for a keen young man like you.
HYDE: Eh, come again?
RUTH: Starting at the bottom.
HYDE: Oh! Anyway, it's just a waste of time. Why should there be any radiation in the receiver room? We're only going to use about ten degrees.
RUTH: Are you willing to take the risk?
HYDE: No.
RUTH: Well, stop beefing then and get on with it.
HYDE: Interstitial activity. nil.
RUTH: Molecular structure stable. Increasing power. Two oh, two five, three oh.
JO: I say, Doctor, you're not going to disappear to Venus or anywhere like that, are you?
DOCTOR : No, no. You just keep your eye on those dials.
JO: It's working!
DOCTOR : Well of course it's working. Now make a note of the readings, will you?
JO: All right.
RUTH: Three five, four oh, four five.
HYDE: Check, check, check!
JO: Well done.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
JO: It's a bit out on distance though. It says the Tardis is only a foot away.
DOCTOR: Oh, that's Venusian feet.
JO: Oh, they're larger than ours.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, much larger. Always tripping over themselves, the Venusians. Good, that's good.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: I think you must have left something on in the Tardis.
DOCTOR: I certainly didn't. why?
JO: Well, it's started again.
DOCTOR: That's impossible unless
JO: Unless what?
DOCTOR: Another Tardis!
RUTH : Isolate matrix scanner.
HYDE: Check.
RUTH : Five oh, five five, six oh.
HYDE: It's going to work!
RUTH : Pipe down and concentrate. Stand by. Initiating transfer now.
HYDE: Ten, nine, eight
MASTER: Why, the fools!
HYDE : Four, three, two, one! 
HYDE: Okay, Ruth, switch off. We've done it!
RUTH : Stuart, come here!
HYDE: Eh?
RUTH : Come here, Stuart!
RUTH: It's a positive feedback. She's overloading! Look, you'll have to bring the surge down as I reduce the power or she'll blow.
HYDE: Right!
HYDE: We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it! We've done it!
DOCTOR: Now, I put it somewhere in that sector there. Anything between fifty and a hundred miles from here.
JO: Well, that's not much to go on.
DOCTOR: No, not unless he switches his Tardis on again.
JO: Well, you never know, he might.
DOCTOR: If we were a bit nearer and in Bessie.
JO: Right. Let's go. You take the map.
MASTER: You are a fool, Doctor Ingram.
RUTH: You have no right to call me a fool
MASTER: Be silent! You may have caused irreparable damage.
RUTH: Look, I was in full control the whole time.
MASTER: That is irrelevant. Mister Hyde, why did you permit this stupidity?
HYDE: Here, hang about, mate. I'm not my sister's keeper. She's the boss. Anyway, I suggested it.
MASTER: Yes, I might have guessed it. You're behaving like a an irresponsible schoolboy. You'll pay for this.
RUTH: The decision, professor, was entirely mine.
MASTER: Ah, I see. Therefore
RUTH: I take I take full responsibility for testing the apparatus, and I'm prepared to justify my actions at the highest level. Perhaps we'd better go and see the Director right away and sort this out.
MASTER: No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Doctor. Please excuse me. That won't be necessary. We need take this matter no further.
RUTH: Well, that's all very well, Professor, but after what you
MASTER: Please, Doctor, accept my apologies.
RUTH: Oh well, perhaps it was a bit unethical of me not to have told you.
HYDE: Oh, come off it, Ruth. He's only climbing down because he doesn't want us to walk out. He needs us for the demo.
MASTER: How very clever of you, Mister Hyde. Of course I need you. Both of you.
HYDE: After all, Prof, we couldn't risk a foul-up this afternoon when the
MASTER: Now say no more. The whole matter is closed.
RUTH: Well, not quite, professor. You see, it wasn't exactly plain sailing. We had some sort of a positive feedback. An overload.
MASTER: But, but that is impossible.
RUTH: See for yourself.
RUTH: See?
MASTER: I see. Yes. Of course, how foolish of me.
HYDE: Hey, Ruth, Professor, come here.
RUTH: What is it, Stu?
HYDE: The crystal. It's still glowing.
MASTER: Well, of course it is!
RUTH: Well, you know what caused the overload then?
MASTER: Yes. Don't you see? You were drawing power from somewhere outside of time itself. Now, what we have to do is to build a time vector filter into the transmitter here. Look, let me show you. something like this.
MASTER: It's a paracybernetic control circuit, in fact.
RUTH: Yes, but won't that take some time to set up? The demonstration's at two.
MASTER: Yes, I'm afraid it will take some time, and I'm afraid I will have to leave it to you, because I am expected to eat a pretentious meal and exchange pleasantries with our distinguished guests.
HYDE: That's all right, Prof. You go and enjoy your nosh. Leave it to the toiling masses.
MASTER: Mister Hyde, I have every faith in you. And in you, Doctor. There.
HYDE: Hey, you'd better get your skates on. The VIP's are arriving. Escorted by a UNIT jeep, no less.
MASTER: What?
MASTER: What are they doing here?
HYDE: Military observers. Happens all the time. They're the only ones with enough money for our sort of nonsense.
MASTER: I see. Doctor Ingram, I've changed my mind. I will set up this filter myself.
RUTH: Well, I'm perfectly capable of constructing a simple circuit, Professor.
MASTER: I am sure that you are equally capable of devouring a tough pheasant on my behalf.
RUTH: Well, why can't you go and devour it?
MASTER: Look, Doctor, please. I am lifelong pacifist. Now the association of the military with killing, with violence. Please bear with me.
RUTH: Very well. I'll get them to send some sandwiches across to you.
HYDE: Good thinking, Batman. We've got a nutcase on our hands.
COOK: He's not dead?
BRIGADIER: No, he's still breathing.
COOK: Who is he?
BRIGADIER: Well, the window cleaner, I presume. He must have fallen off that ladder. It's a miracle he's still alive.
COOK: Oh, poor fellow. Well, come along, Proctor. I trust you'll make the necessary arrangements to get him into hospital.
BRIGADIER: Of course, sir. Sergeant Benton?
BENTON: Sir?
JO: It's a doomy old day. I mean, just look at that sky. Just look at it.
DOCTOR: Do stop wiffling, Jo, there's a good girl. We're not out on a pleasure jaunt, you know?
JO: Sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Only, if it is the Master, we can't run the risk of losing him. You just keep your eye on the time sensor.
JO: Right.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yeah?
JO: It's working again.
DOCTOR: What's the bearing?
JO: Er, oh seven four, and, er, sixteen point three nine miles away.
DOCTOR: Well, that's Venusian miles. In Earth miles, that's be about seventy two point seven nine. Let's take a look at the map. Well, we're about here. That should put us somewhere around there. A village called Wootton.
JO: Wootton? Well, that's where the Brigadier and Sergeant Benton are.
DOCTOR: TOM-TIT? Well, if the Master's behind that. What time's the demonstration?
JO: Two o'clock.
DOCTOR: We've got to stop it. Hang on tight, Jo.
COOK: There you are, Charles. It may seem churlish of me after eating your excellent lunch, but how the institute can afford pheasant, I really don't know.
PERCIVAL: We are in the depths of the country, you know.
COOK: Be that as it may. We are responsible for international funds, public money. I doubt very much whether we should allow ourselves the luxury of either pheasants or TOM-TITS.
RUTH: Well, the Professor doesn't seem to be here, gentlemen.
PERCIVAL: Obviously.
RUTH: Ah, Stuart. Where's the professor?
HYDE: Search me. He was here a couple of minutes ago.
COOK: Who is this fellow Thascales, anyway? I've never heard of him.
PERCIVAL: Oh, an excellent background. Surely you've read his paper on the granule structure of time?
COOK: All I can do to keep up with the departmental minutes. I leave all the rest to Proctor.
BRIGADIER: That's a fearsome looking load of electronic nonsense you've got together, Doctor Ingram? How does it all work? In words of one syllable.
RUTH: I'll do my best. Well, gentleman, to begin with, time isn't smooth. It's made up of little bits.
HYDE: A series of minute present moments.
RUTH: That's it. Temporal atoms, so to speak. So, if one could push something through the interstices between them, it would be outside our space-time continuum altogether.
BRIGADIER: Where would it be then?
RUTH: Well, nowhere at all in ordinary terms.
BRIGADIER: You've lost me, Doctor Ingram.
COOK: And me. I've never heard such a farrago of unscientific rubbish in all my life. It's a impossible situation.
HYDE: But we've done it. We shoved that vase through and brought it back, in there.
BRIGADIER: But shoved it through where, for goodness sake?
BENTON: Sort of through the crack between now and now, sir.
HYDE: Right, you've got it.
BRIGADIER: Well I give up. It's beyond me.
MASTER: Then you must see for yourselves, gentlemen. I apologise for keeping you waiting. Shall we begin?
JO: Doctor, slow down. It's not safe to drive so quickly. Please!
DOCTOR: Nonsense! It's perfectly safe. My reactions are ten times faster than yours. Bessie's no ordinary car, remember?
DOCTOR: See what I mean?
JO: But why didn't I go through the windscreen?
DOCTOR: Well, the brakes work by the absorption of inertia, including yours.
JO: It's working again.
DOCTOR: Right, come on, Bessie, old girl. It's up to you now. 
RUTH: Surely you don't need to wear anti-radiation gear, Professor?
MASTER: In case of an emergency, Doctor. I may have to join Mister Hyde in a hurry. Report, Mister Hyde?
HYDE: Interstitial activity nil.
RUTH: Molecular structure stable. Four oh, four five, five oh.
MASTER: Increasing power.
RUTH: Isolate matrix scanner.
HYDE : Check.
RUTH: Six oh, six five, seven oh, seven five.
MASTER: Increasing power.
RUTH: It's gone into the second quadrant already, Professor.
MASTER: I know what I'm doing, Doctor. Initiating transfer now.
HYDE : Ten, nine, eight
HYDE: Seven, six, five
HYDE : Four, three, two, one.
HYDE: I'm getting too much power. I can't hold it. Switch off!
RUTH: Turn it off, Professor! Turn it off!
MASTER: Come, Kronos, come!
Episode Two
RUTH: Stuart! No, no, wait, it's too dangerous. Professor!
DOCTOR: Right, Jo. Jo?
DOCTOR: Oh, good grief.
DOCTOR: Cut the power!
RUTH: I can't. It won't budge!
DOCTOR: Then reverse the polarity!
RUTH: What?
DOCTOR: Reverse the temporal polarity!
BRIGADIER: Is it safe to go in?
RUTH: No, wait.
COOK: What is all this about?
BRIGADIER: Oh, for heaven's sake. There's a man in there.
RUTH: Right, the level should be all right now.
BRIGADIER: Doctor.
RUTH: Stuart!
COOK: If this meant to be some kind of a joke.
PERCIVAL: What on earth is going on?
DOCTOR: Who is this?
RUTH: My assistant. But Stuart's only twenty five.
DOCTOR: Twenty five? This man's eighty or more.
JO: What's happening, Doctor? Are we too late?
DOCTOR: On the contrary, Jo, I think we're just in time.
BRIGADIER: How is he?
DOCTOR: Well, what he needs at the moment is rest. We'll get him to the hospital later. He must have been a pretty tough youngster.
RUTH: He was.
DOCTOR: Well, lucky for him. Otherwise the shock of the change would have finished him off.
JO: But will he be all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, he'll survive.
RUTH: Yes, but how long for, Doctor? He's an old man.
BRIGADIER: What caused it, Doctor, some sort of radioactivity?
DOCTOR: No, it was more than that.
JO: A change in metabolism?
DOCTOR: Well, that's more like it, Jo, but it still isn't the answer, even if the metabolic rate had increased a hundredfold.
RUTH: That's impossible.
DOCTOR: Well, of course it is. Even if it wasn't, the change in him would have taken seven or eight months, not eight seconds.
BRIGADIER: Well, there's only one thing I know which makes people old.
DOCTOR: And that is?
BRIGADIER: Anno Domini, Doctor. Age, the passing of time.
RUTH: We all know that.
DOCTOR: Congratulations, Brigadier. I think you've provided the explanation.
BRIGADIER: Well, glad to be of service. What did I say?
DOCTOR: The passing of time. That's the only possible answer. Stuart's own personal time speeded up so enormously that his whole physiological life passed by in a moment. But why? How did it happen?
RUTH: Well, the Professor might know but he seems to have disappeared.
JO: What professor?
RUTH: Professor Thascales. TOM-TIT's his baby.
DOCTOR: Thascales. Really, the arrogance of that man is beyond belief.
BRIGADIER: Well, whose arrogance? Doctor, I wish you wouldn't talk in riddles.
DOCTOR: Perhaps a classical education would have helped you, Brigadier. Thascales is a Greek word.
JO: Thascales? I get it. Thascales is Greek for Master.
DOCTOR: Right, Jo.
RUTH: He's coming round.
HYDE: Help me. Help.
JO: It's all right. it's all right. You're quite safe.
HYDE: No, nobody's safe. No one's safe. Oh, he's here, he's here. I saw him. I saw him.
RUTH: Oh, the poor boy's delirious.
HYDE: No, no, no
RUTH: Don't try to speak, Stu. Just rest.
DOCTOR: No, no, let him talk. Who did you see, Stuart? Answer me.
HYDE: Danger. The crystal.
RUTH: Please stop this, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Look, answer me, Stuart. Who did you see?
BRIGADIER: Go easy, Doctor.
HYDE: No. No.
JO: Doctor, please.
DOCTOR: Be quiet, both of you. Now answer me. Who did you see? Answer me!
HYDE: The Kronos!
DOCTOR: Kronos! Yes, of course. I should have known. Doctor Ingram, I want you to come with me. I want you to tell me everything that you know about that machine of yours.
JO: Shall I come?
DOCTOR: No, no, you stay here with Stuart. Phone me immediately he starts talking again.
BRIGADIER: You'd better lock the door behind us, Miss Grant.
DOCTOR: Brigadier, don't hang about. I have a job for you too, you know.
YATES: Newton Institute Wootton. Got that, sir. Over.
BRIGADIER :  Get two sections over here right away. Over.
YATES: Say again, sir. I didn't quite get that. Over.
BRIGADIER: I said, bring some men with you. I feel as naked as a babe in his bath. I'll want light and heavy machine guns. Oh, and Yates? Shove a couple of anti-tank guns in the boot, will you? Over.
YATES : You've got tanks there, sir? Over.
BRIGADIER: You never know, Captain. You never know. Over.
YATES : Right, sir, and, er, when, sir? I mean, how soon? Over.
BRIGADIER: Oh, the usual, Captain Yates. About ten minutes ago. Oh, Yates? The Doctor wants you to bring his Tardis with you. All right? Over.
YATES : Right, sir. Out.
COOK: I'm sorry, Charles, but the whole thing smells of bad fish. We'll be well out of it.
PERCIVAL: But I'd stake my reputation on the professor's integrity.
COOK: You already have, Charles. You already have. A foolish gamble gone wrong. Now, it's not surprising that you lost.
PERCIVAL: Please, Humphrey!
COOK: I can see no alternative to a full Whitehall inquiry. I can only hope that we don't have to parade our dirty linen at Westminster, not to mention Brussels.
BRIGADIER: Forgive me. Mister Cook?
COOK: Doctor Cook.
BRIGADIER: I'm so sorry. Doctor Cook. I couldn't help overhearing what you said.
COOK: Well?
BRIGADIER: This affair's no longer in your hands, sir.
COOK: I beg your pardon?
BRIGADIER: It's now a security matter. I've taken over.
COOK: You have no right.
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, I've every right. Subsection 3A of the preamble to the Seventh Enabling Act. Paragraph 24G, if I remember rightly.
COOK: Oh.
BRIGADIER: So, bearing in mind the Official Secrets Act as well, you'll please make certain that you say not a word about today's events to anybody. Either of you.
PROCTOR: That's all very well, but
COOK: Be quiet, Proctor. You can't possible have sufficient grounds for such high-handed behaviour.
BRIGADIER: This man, Thascales, is a dangerous criminal and an escaped prisoner. Sufficient grounds?
COOK: Oh, well, er, yes. Come along, Proctor, don't stand about. You'll be hearing from us, Charles.
BRIGADIER: Oh, excuse me, sir. Doctor Percival?
PERCIVAL: Yes? What?
BRIGADIER: You feeling quite well, sir?
PERCIVAL: Yes, yes, of course I am. Oh, this whole matter is a shock, but. What did you want?
BRIGADIER: I'd like this whole place evacuated of all but essential personnel at once, please.
PERCIVAL: I can't think, Brigadier, you have the slightest idea of what you're asking. There are projects in train
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry, sir, but it's absolutely necessary. Now Sergeant Benton will keep an eye on this machine of yours until the troops arrive, but I cannot be held responsible for the consequences unless you do as I ask.
PERCIVAL: Brigadier, you may enjoy playing at soldiers
BRIGADIER: By three o'clock, please, Doctor Percival. And if the Master contacts you, don't try to hold onto him. Just let me know at once.
PERCIVAL: Who?
BRIGADIER: I'm sorry. Of course, I mean the Professor.
PERCIVAL: But he'll be miles away by now.
BRIGADIER: I doubt it. There's no reason why he should know we're onto him. He'll be back.
DOCTOR: Any trouble?
BENTON: I've been a bit lonely, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
RUTH: But, Doctor, why won't you explain?
DOCTOR: Because I must find out whether I'm right, that's why. Now where's the crystal?
RUTH: It's through here.
RUTH: There.
DOCTOR: The crystal of Kronos. So I am right.
RUTH: Kronos? Well, that's what Stuart said. Look, Doctor, what is all this about?
DOCTOR: Well, it'll be difficult to accept, I warn you.
RUTH: Well, try me.
DOCTOR: Well, luckily you are already familiar with the idea of stepping outside of space-time.
RUTH: I've lived with the concept for months.
DOCTOR: And I've lived with it for many long years. I've been there.
RUTH: You have?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have. Strange place it is, too. A place that is no place. A dangerous place where creatures love beyond your wildest imagination. Kronovores, time eaters. They swallow a life as quickly as a boa constrictor can swallow a rabbit, fur and all.
RUTH: Are you saying that Kronos is one of these creatures?
DOCTOR: I am. The most fearsome of the lot.
PERCIVAL: You! What're you doing here?
MASTER: Now don't panic. Shut the door and come here.
PERCIVAL: But they'll find you.
MASTER: Not if you keep your head. Why should they look for me here anyway? Look, don't fidget, please.
RUTH: But Kronos was a Greek legend. He was the Titan who ate his children, wasn't he?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. And what's more, one of those children in the legend was Poseidon, the god of Atlantis.
RUTH: Are you trying to tell us that the classical gods are real?
DOCTOR: Well, yes and no. Extraordinary people, the Atlanteans, you know. Even more extraordinary than their cousins in Athens. Once reality became unbearable for them, they would invent a legend to tame it.
RUTH: You mean like the legend of Kronos.
DOCTOR: Quite so. Kronos, a living creature, was drawn at a time by the priests of Atlantis, using that crystal as its centre.
RUTH: You mean, that that crystal is the original? The actual crystal from Atlantis?
DOCTOR: It is, and your friend the professor, is trying to use that crystal, as it was used four thousand years ago, to capture the Kronavore.
RUTH: So that's what you meant when you talked of terrible danger.
BENTON: Danger to us, you mean, Doctor, or to the whole world?
DOCTOR: Not just danger to our world, Sergeant, or even our galaxy, but to the entire created universe.
PERCIVAL: But suppose somebody should walk in here now and find me talking to you.
MASTER: Oh dear, you are a worrier, aren't you. Come here. Closer. Now look into my eyes. There is nothing to worry about. Everything will be all right if you just obey me. Just obey me.
PERCIVAL: Obey. I must obey. Everything will be all right.
MASTER: That's better. Now you go along there and carry along with your telephoning, and let me get on with my sums. You know, it's a long time since I came across a hypnotic subject who turned out to be as good as you are. It's just like old times.
DOCTOR: There are two things I don't quite understand, though. One is the massive power build up that you had, and the second is the strength of the signal that I received on the time sensor.
RUTH: Yes, but you said yourself it picks up all time field disturbances.
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed it does. The strength of the signal was far too strong for an apparatus as crude as this. However. Ah.
BENTON: Well, what is it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, I thought it would be around here somewhere.
DOCTOR: This, Sergeant, is the Master's Tardis.
MASTER: E to the power of seven C. E equals MC cubed.
PERCIVAL: Squared.  Er, yes, thank you. At once.
MASTER: What?
PERCIVAL: E equals MC squared, not cubed.
MASTER: Not in the extra-temporal physics of the time vortex. Oh dear, now you've made me lose my place. You're an interfering dolt, Percival.
PERCIVAL: I am sorry. What are you doing?
MASTER: Oh dear, I am trying to find out why we had that massive power build-up. It makes the whole experiment uncontrollable, even the filter didn't prevent it and logically, it just shouldn't happen.
DOCTOR: Logically, it just shouldn't happen.
RUTH: But it did.
DOCTOR: Yes, indeed it did. So, there's only one thing left for us to do. Wouldn't you agree, Sergeant?
BENTON: Oh, yes, sure. What, for instance?
DOCTOR: Switch on, and take a look for ourselves.
RUTH: Right.
DOCTOR: It's reading ten already.
RUTH: But that's impossible!
BENTON: Doctor? Doctor, the crystal's glowing.
DOCTOR: Sergeant, now you're a strong young man. Go in there and pick up that crystal, will you?
BENTON: Doctor, Stuart was
DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe at this low level. Believe me.
BENTON: If you say so, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I do.
BENTON: It's fixed down.
DOCTOR: No, it isn't, you know. You can see it isn't.
BENTON: Well, I can't shift it.
DOCTOR: No. No, of course you can't. And do you know why you can't shift it? Because that crystal isn't really here at all. It's made the jump through interstitial time. It must to be linked to that other crystal all those thousands of years ago. Or rather it is the other crystal.
RUTH: But then where is the original one?
DOCTOR: Where do you think? In Atlantis, of course.
NEOPHITE: Holiness! Holiness! Come quickly! The crystal is afire!
 KRASIS: At last. At last, Kronos, the time is come, and I await your call.
BENTON : Excuse me, Doctor.
BENTON: Sergeant Benton? Ah, hello, Miss Grant. Yeah. Yeah, he's here. Oh, I see. Look, hang on a sec. Doctor?
BENTON: Doctor, it's Jo. She says Stuart Hyde's coming to. He's in a bit of a state, it seems.
DOCTOR: All right. Tell her that I'm on my way. You'd better stay here, Sergeant.
BENTON: Right.
DOCTOR: Coming, Ruth? Er, Doctor Ingram?
RUTH: Ruth will do.
BENTON: Hello, Jo?
JO: It's all right, I heard. Well, no, not scared exactly. Just a bit, well, you know, churned up. Yeah, and a merry Michaelmas to you too.
HYDE: Kronos.
JO: Oh lor, I'm forgetting my patient. See you, Sergeant.
HYDE: Kronos.
JO: Are you all right?
HYDE: I felt him coming back.
JO: Who?
HYDE: Kronos. Oh, don't let him touch me.
JO: It's all right. You're all right.
HYDE: Oh, I'm burning. I'm burning.
JO: You're quite safe, honestly. Shush, shush. You're safe.
HYDE: Who are you?
JO: I'm Jo.
HYDE: Oh, where am I?
JO: You're in your own room.
HYDE: Oh, I've got the granddaddy of all hangovers. My hands. What's happened to my hands?
JO: It's all right. It's all right, honestly. It's a difficult thing to
HYDE: A mirror.
JO: There isn't one.
HYDE: Give me a mirror.
JO: Please, I'll get you one later. Come on, now just lie down and
HYDE: Oh, no. No. No.
MASTER: Oh oh three five seven. Point oh oh three five seven. Good.
PERCIVAL: You've finished?
MASTER: Yes, at last. Now, back to the laboratory.
PERCIVAL: Yes, well, they'll have somebody on guard.
MASTER: Oh, yes. You don't happen to know who it is, do you?
PERCIVAL: Yes, a Sergeant Benton, I think.
MASTER: Really? Well, I think I know how to deal with him.
HYDE: It was just after the cup and saucer appeared. I was about to switch off when it happened.
DOCTOR: Go on, old chap. Go on, you're doing fine.
HYDE: Like a tongue of flame. All my body was on fire. All my life, all my energy, was being sucked out of me.
DOCTOR: Why did you say Kronos?
HYDE: Because that's who it was.
DOCTOR: How did you know?
HYDE: I just knew.
RUTH: You mean you heard a voice or something?
HYDE: No, I just knew.
DOCTOR: It's a race memory. We all have them.
JO: But what is Kronos? Or should I say who?
DOCTOR: Later, Jo, later. Go on, Stuart, what else?
HYDE: Nothing else until I woke up here. Doc, am I really an old man? Is there nothing you can do, or am I stuck like this?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Stuart. I just don't know. But I promise you that we'll do everything we possibly can to help you.
BENTON: Hello?
PERCIVAL : Hello. Is that Sergeant Benton?
BENTON: Yes.
PERCIVAL : This is the director. The Brigadier wishes to see you back at the house.
BENTON: But I don't get it. The Brigadier wants me back at the house?
PERCIVAL : Yes, that's right. At once.
BENTON: Yes, but that means leaving the lab unwatched.
PERCIVAL: Oh, but he said to be sure to lock up. Those were his very words.
 
BENTON: I don't know, Doctor Percival. I mean, you've put me in a bit of a spot. The Brigadier told me to stay here no matter what happened. He'll have my stripes if I don't.
PERCIVAL: One minute.
MASTER: What's the matter?
PERCIVAL: I don't think he believes me.
MASTER: I'm not surprised. I've never seen a more inept performance. Look, tell him to ring the Brigadier for confirmation.
PERCIVAL: But you can't
MASTER: Do as I tell you!
PERCIVAL: Sergeant Benton? I suggest you check with Brigadier Stewart yourself. Er, oh, you want his number? Er.
PERCIVAL: Oh yes, I think you can contact him on five three four. Yeah. Yes, that's right.
PERCIVAL : Goodbye.
BENTON: Goodbye.
MASTER: Lethbridge Stewart?
BENTON : Hello, Sergeant Benton here, sir.
MASTER: Ah, Benton.
BENTON: Sir, I've just had the most peculiar phone call.
MASTER: Nothing peculiar about it, my dear fellow. Perfectly simple. I need you over here, on the double.
BENTON : Right, sir.
MASTER: Well?
PERCIVAL: No sign of him. Do you think he really will. Ah, there he is.
PERCIVAL: It worked! It really worked!
MASTER: Of course it worked. Now see if the corridor's clear.
PERCIVAL: Not a soul, Professor.
PERCIVAL: These are trying times.
MASTER: Time? Soon I shall have the time in the world, literally.
PERCIVAL: In an hour or so, the place will be swarming with soldiers.
MASTER: Doctor Percival, you're beginning to irritate me. Now do be quiet. I tell you that nobody and nothing can stop me now.
BENTON: Put your hands in the air, both of you. Get them up. Now turn around slowly. Slowly.
MASTER: Well, well, well. The resourceful Sergeant Benton.
BENTON: You didn't really think you could fool me with a fake telephone call, did you? It's the oldest trick in the book.
MASTER: I underestimated you, Sergeant. How did you know?
BENTON: Simple. The Brigadier's not in the habit of calling Sergeants my dear fellow.
MASTER: Ah. The tribal taboos of army etiquette. I find it difficult to identify with such primitive absurdities.
BENTON: Yes, well, primitive or not, mate, you're still in the soup without a ladle, aren't you.
MASTER: Now, Sergeant, you must let me explain.
BENTON: Keep back! Keep back.
MASTER: Yes, of course.
BENTON: Keep back.
MASTER: Of course, Sergeant. You see, Sergeant Benton, the whole point is that. Doctor! What a very timely
MASTER: You're wrong, Sergeant Benton. That is the oldest trick in the book.
PERCIVAL: What are you going to do?
MASTER: I am going to bring somebody here who can help me find the power that I need. Without it, I am helpless.
PERCIVAL: I don't understand.
MASTER: Of course you don't understand! How could you possibly understand? Only one thing stands between me and complete power over the Earth, over the universe itself. Now the one I bring here will show me how to harness that power. Now, you watch that crystal!
KRASIS: Lord of life, give me of thy power. Oh, mighty Kronos, lord of death, give me thy power! Oh, mighty Kronos, lord of life, give me thy strength!
KRASIS: Mighty lord, exalted one. I hear and obey!
Episode Three
MASTER: Welcome! Welcome!
KRASIS: I am Krasis, High Priest of the temple of Poseidon in Atlantis.
MASTER: Poseidon? But surely Kronos is your lord?
KRASIS: You would dare profane, with your irreverent tongue, the great secret, the mystery which no man dare speak? Who are you?
MASTER: I am the Master. Lord of time and ruler of Kronos.
KRASIS: You are lying! No one rules Kronos!
MASTER: I shall, with your help.
KRASIS: You
MASTER: And together we shall become masters of the universe.
PERCIVAL: Professor!
MASTER: Oh, let him go. He can do us no harm now. Come with me.
KRASIS: Is this the abode of lord Kronos?
MASTER: No, but with you to assist me, I shall bring him here.
KRASIS: I exist only to do his will. He is not to be commanded.
MASTER: Oh, but surely Kronos obeyed the priests of Kronos as a pet dog obeys his master?
KRASIS: You
MASTER: The truth, Krasis?
KRASIS: It is so written.
MASTER: Ah. Well, therefore you have the secret. You have the formula.
KRASIS: No, it is lost. For five centuries it has been lost to Atlantis.
MASTER: Was nothing handed down?
KRASIS: Nothing.
MASTER: Nothing at all?
KRASIS: Nothing, save the crystal and the seal of the high priest.
MASTER: But that's it! From this seal, I can learn the true constants! Kronos is in my power at last.
DOCTOR: Rest. That's all you need at the moment, until your body recovers from the shock.
HYDE: A charming prospect, I must say. Hey, Ruth? You'd better find out about my old age pension. After all, I'll be twenty six in seven weeks time.
RUTH: Try not to be too bitter, Stu.
HYDE: Huh.
BENTON: Doctor?
JO: Sergeant Benton.
BENTON: Doctor, it's the Master. He's there in the laboratory.
PERCIVAL: But how can Atlantean measurements mean anything to you?
MASTER: Comparative ratios remain constant throughout time. If you have nothing intelligent to say, do please keep quiet. Right. Now we switch on.
DOCTOR: Are you sure he said he was from Atlantis?
BENTON: Yes, he just appeared from nowhere.
BRIGADIER: Right, what are we waiting for? Benton, Doctor, on the double! Females stay under cover. Right, Miss Grant?
DOCTOR: Brigadier, wait!
RUTH: Hey, wait for me. Females indeed.
JO: Doctor, look!
DOCTOR: A massive feedback of time. Jo, it's too late. Kronos is coming.
MASTER: Come, Kronos, come!
MASTER: Kronos, welcome!
PERCIVAL: No!
MASTER: Kronos, be at peace. I am your friend!
KRASIS: You will never control Kronos! He is the ruler of time! He is the destroyer! We are doomed!
MASTER: Rubbish! Kronos, hear me! I order you to obey!
MASTER: Well, well, well. So the pet dog does obey him master, eh? Right, you stay in your kennel until I have need of you.
DOCTOR: Just as I thought. They've run right into trouble. Jo, you stay here.
DOCTOR: She'll be all right now she's outside the limit.
JO: What's the matter with them?
RUTH: What's happening?
JO: Are you all right?
RUTH: What's going on?
JO: Don't worry. The Doctor'll explain later. I hope.
KRASIS: What are you doing?
MASTER: Reversing the interstitial flow. Now don't interrupt me. I've got to concentrate.
KRASIS: You have not the power to control him!
MASTER: I shall have, never fear. Just give me time. Now, I must put him back where he belongs.
BRIGADIER: What, what, what on Earth, Doctor? Will you please kindly explain in
DOCTOR: There's really no time to explain now. Benton, take the chair. Everybody inside. Quick.
MASTER: Right, it's safe to go in now, most noble high priest.
MASTER: Thank you for your help.
KRASIS: I am no slave that I should serve you. I serve only the gods.
MASTER: You'll serve me, Krasis, and you'll like it.
KRASIS: You dare mock the high priest?
MASTER: Take care. I can always bring Kronos back, you know.
KRASIS: No! No, I beseech you. What is your will?
MASTER: Knowledge. Your knowledge of the ancient mysteries. Why could I not control him?
KRASIS: For all your sorcery, you are as a child trying to control a rogue elephant. A puny child.
MASTER: But I have the crystal.
KRASIS: That crystal is but a part of the true crystal of Kronos. A small fraction.
MASTER: Fraction? And the rest is in Atlantis?
KRASIS: Deep in the vaults of the temple of Poseidon, guarded by night and by day from such thieves as you. You may command the slave but never shall you command the Mighty One himself.
MASTER: You think not? We shall see.
HIPPIAS: Do you see, most venerable king? The crystal has gone.
DALIOS: And Krasis?
HIPPIAS: I was here. The sky opened and a sphere of fire hurled by the hand of Zeus
DALIOS: Yes, yes, yes, I saw the thunderstorm myself. What next?
HIPPIAS: They disappeared, Krasis and the crystal together like smoke. What does it mean, Lord Dalios? Has the time come at last?
DALIOS: You are young, Hippias. As young in years as in the sacred mysteries. What do you know of Kronos?
HIPPIAS: The years of Kronos were the golden years of Atlantis. Perhaps he will return to us.
DALIOS: That is my fear. Our world is in great danger. Come!
DALIOS: How old would you think me, boy?
HIPPIAS: A great age, Dalios.
DALIOS: How great?
HIPPIAS: Four score years or more, perhaps.
DALIOS: A stripling of eighty summers? No, Hippias, when these eyes were clear like yours, I saw the building of the temple. I was a witness at the enthronement of the image of the great god Poseidon himself.
HIPPIAS: But, that was, well, it must have been five hundred years ago.
DALIOS: Five hundred and thirty seven.
HIPPIAS: Dalios, will you have me believe you are
DALIOS: I am.
HIPPIAS: What is it, that light?
DALIOS: It is the light of true crystal of Kronos. This is the great secret, the veritable mystery. But now that Krasis has gone, you alone know the secret. You must guard it with your life.
HIPPIAS: I shall, my lord.
DALIOS: There is nothing to fear, it is the guardian. Return to your rest! It is I, Dalios!
HIPPIAS: What, who was it? You said no other person shares the great mystery.
DALIOS: The guardian is a person no longer. A thing, a creature, too horrible to imagine. Half man, half beast. Come.
HYDE: Make yourselves comfortable, if you can.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
BRIGADIER: All right, Doctor, go on. What next. Having picked us all up by the scruff of the neck and bundled us all in here, what do you propose to do with us?
DOCTOR: Nothing at all. There's nothing to be done except wait.
JO: I seem to have heard that before.
DOCTOR: Speaking personally, I'd love a cup of tea. How about it, Stuart?
HYDE: I'll put the kettle on. Hey, Ruth, get the mugs out.
RUTH: Right.
HYDE: How about a sandwich? Only marmalade, I'm afraid.
BENTON: I'd love one, please.
BRIGADIER: This isn't a picnic. One moment you're talking about the entire universe blowing up, and the next you're going on about tea. Doctor! What's happening?
DOCTOR: A great deal. For instance, you, Brigadier, you were caught in a hiatus in time. Being without becoming. An ontological absurdity.
BRIGADIER: I don't understand a word you're saying.
JO: Well, it's true. You and Benton and Doctor Ingram, well, you were, you were stuck.
BRIGADIER: Nothing of the sort, Miss Grant.
DOCTOR: Well, you wouldn't be aware of it, of course, because your time had slowed down too.
BENTON: And all because of this TOM-TIT gadget?
DOCTOR: Yes, so it would seem. After all, it did make a crack in time, didn't it?
JO: A what?
BRIGADIER: Oh, a gap between the now and the now, as Sergeant Benton put it.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. We're bound to experience all kinds of freak side effects.
RUTH: You mean, even leaving Kronos and the crystal right out of it?
DOCTOR: Correct.
RUTH: Marmalade sandwich?
DOCTOR: No, thank you. Jo?
RUTH: Well, why weren't we affected when we were actually working the machine? I mean, we weren't slowed down.
DOCTOR: Well, you stand right under a fountain, you don't necessarily get wet, do you?
RUTH: Oh, I see.
BRIGADIER: Well, I'm dashed if I do. Doctor, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Me? Collecting.
MASTER: Right! Now we shall soon be ready to move.
KRASIS: Master, he may return. The Mighty One may return.
MASTER: Oh, fortunate Atlantis, to be blessed with such a courageous high priest. Never fear. Kronos will only return if I desire it.
KRASIS: But the crystal.
MASTER: I am reversing the interstitial flow, thus draining the time energy from the crystal. Otherwise, we couldn't take it with us.
KRASIS: We? Where are we going?
MASTER: Where do you think? Atlantis, of course.
DOCTOR: Well, he must be stopped.
BRIGADIER: Fair enough. Why don't we get on with it?
DOCTOR: Because we can't even find out what he's up to without the Tardis. A bottle. I need a bottle.
HYDE: How about this?
DOCTOR: No, no, that won't do. One with a narrow neck. A wine bottle.
HYDE: Moroccan burgundy, for instance?
DOCTOR: Yes, that'll do nicely.
HYDE: There we are.
DOCTOR: Fine. And the cork?
HYDE: Oh, you've got me there, I'm afraid.
RUTH: How about this, Stu?
HYDE: Oh, remarkable efficiency. Still on the corkscrew.
DOCTOR: Well done.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, I must insist. What are you up to?
DOCTOR: Delaying tactics, Brigadier. A small fly in the Master's metaphorical ointment.
MASTER: Right, nearly there.
KRASIS: The fire is dying. You are indeed the Master.
DOCTOR: Do give me a fork, Jo, will you?
DOCTOR: Right. So far, so good.
RUTH: Another nutcase.
HYDE: Fruit cake standard.
JO: You just wait and see.
MASTER: Right, Krasis, you'll have to help me to carry it.
KRASIS: No! No, I dare not.
MASTER: But there's nothing to be afraid of, I promise you. Do as I tell you.
KRASIS: Master, do not compel me, I beseech you.
BRIGADIER: And what's that meant to be?
DOCTOR: You're a philistine, Brigadier. It's not meant to be anything. It just is. I hope.
RUTH: You mean it's just a ridiculous piece of modern art?
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. It's a time flow analogue.
HYDE: Of course it is, Ruth. You should have seen that at a glance.
DOCTOR: The relationships between the different molecular bonds and the actual shapes form a crystalline structure of ratios.
BRIGADIER: Does this make any sort of sense, Doctor Ingram?
RUTH: None whatsoever.
BRIGADIER: Just as I thought. Doctor, please stop this silly game at once.
DOCTOR: Patience, Brigadier, patience. Now then, here goes.
DOCTOR: Oh dear.
JO: What's up?
DOCTOR: Well, it doesn't work.
BRIGADIER: You astound me.
HYDE: Bad luck, Doc. Have a cup of tea and drown your sorrows.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Tea! Yes, of course. Tea leaves.
DOCTOR: Tea leaves.
MASTER: I give you my firm pledge, Krasis. The crystal is totally inactive.
KRASIS: It, it looks dead.
MASTER: Well, of course it is. I promise you.
DOCTOR: Right, here we go.
KRASIS: No! No, the crystals afire! The great one comes again!
MASTER: The meddling fool!
JO: But what does it do? I mean, how does it actually affect the Master's plans.
DOCTOR: Well, it's just like jamming a radio signal, Jo. We used to make them at school to spoil each other's time experiments.
RUTH: I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.
RUTH: Oh!
DOCTOR: Ah, well. It was fun while it lasted.
YATES : Greyhound. Greyhound. This is Greyhound Three. Over.
BRIGADIER : Greyhound Three, Greyhound. Thank you, Captain Yates. And where have you been? Over.
YATES : Greyhound Three. Won't be long now, sir. About ten miles or so. Over.
BRIGADIER : Greyhound. Get your skates on, will you? We need the Doctor's Tardis here double quick. Out.
YATES : Greyhound Three. Wilco. Out.
KRASIS: Images that move and speak. Wagons but no oxen to draw them. This is indeed a time of wonders.
MASTER: I will show you greater wonders than either.
KRASIS: Master Lord, you will not bring the Mighty One here once more.
MASTER: Certainly not. I will just give you a demonstration of my power over time. Now, you watch this carefully.
YATES: Look out!
YATES: Greyhound Three? We're stuck in the mud. Forced off the road by some goon in fancy dress. I think. Over.
BRIGADIER: Are you suffering from hallucinations, Captain Yates, or have you been drinking? Over.
YATES: I could do with one, I don't mind telling you. This character in armour just galloped at us. You know, sir, the King Arthur bit. Then he vanished.
BRIGADIER: In a puff of blue smoke, I suppose. You have been drinking!
MASTER: And that, Captain Yates, was just a sample.
YATES: Right, Sergeant, get a shift on. I want to get out of here.
SERGEANT: Right, lads, everybody out!
YATES: Right, Sergeant. Get your
SERGEANT: Look, sir.
YATES: Hey! What do you think you're up to?
YATES: Get down! Blithering idiot means it.
YATES: Greyhound? Greyhound? Over.
BRIGADIER: I'm listening, Captain Yates. Over.
YATES: Another hallucination, sir. Roundheads attacking us with ball ammunition.
YATES: Cannon balls, in fact. Out.
BRIGADIER: Captain Yates, if this is some sort of a joke, I
DOCTOR: Believe me, Brigadier, this is no kind of a joke. This is deadly serious.
BRIGADIER: All right, Doctor, you tell me what's going on.
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? Roundheads? Horsemen in armour? The Master's using that crystal to bring them back in time.
BRIGADIER: So why don't we get over there and stop him.
DOCTOR: Because it would be suicide to go anywhere without the protection of the Tardis.
BENTON: And that's stuck in the mud being battered by a load of Roundheads.
DOCTOR: We'd better go and fetch it. Come on. Come on, Jo. Brigadier, are you coming?
BRIGADIER: Yes. Sergeant Benton, you'd better stay here. If the Master shows his face, you know what to do.
BENTON: Yes, sir.
RUTH: Can I come, Brigadier?
HYDE: I've always fancied myself as a bit of a cavalier.
BRIGADIER: Sorry, you'd better stay here with the Sergeant.
RUTH: But Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: You're the only people who can handle that infernal machine, apart from the Doctor. I must ask you to place yourself under the Sergeant's command. Both of you. Right?
RUTH: Full of old world charm, isn't he?
DOCTOR: Do buck up, Lethbridge Stewart.
BRIGADIER: Sorry, Doctor, a matter of some urgency. Better go under my own steam. Cheers. See you there. Try not to be far behind.
KRASIS: But why? Do you fear this machine so much?
MASTER: I fear nothing. It's just that I intend to go to Atlantis and I don't want my enemy to follow us. Now get on with it, you seventeenth century poltroons.
MASTER: I could have told you that wouldn't work, Captain Yates. Now stand by to duck, for here comes the grand finale.
RUTH: What's that?
HYDE: It sounds like a motorbike.
BENTON: Yeah, but it's coming from the sky.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mmm?
JO: There's something wrong with the engine.
DOCTOR: Never. Why?
JO: Well, listen. There's a funny noise.
DOCTOR: Oh, no.
BRIGADIER: What's up?
DOCTOR: Listen.
BRIGADIER: It can't be!
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it can. Displaced in time, but that's real enough. That's a V1.
JO: What?
DOCTOR: A V1, a doodlebug, a buzzbomb. The Germans used them towards the end of the Hitler war.
JO: Well, what did they do?
BRIGADIER: Blew up sizeable chunks of London. If that engine cuts out, then fall flat on your face because that'll mean its on the way down.
JO: Look, there's the convoy.
BRIGADIER: Greyhound Three, Greyhound Three. Can you hear me, Captain Yates? Over.
YATES : Greyhound Three, I can only just hear you. Over.
BRIGADIER: Yates, that thing is a bomb and its on its way to you. Over!
YATES : Say again, say again. I cannot read you. Over.
DOCTOR: Jo, out of the car. Get down.
BRIGADIER: Yates, get out of it, man! It's a bomb! It's a bomb! Get out of it, Yates!
YATES : All right, lads, it's a bomb! Dive!
BRIGADIER: Yates? Yates, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Over! Mike, can you hear me?
Episode Four
BENTON: Brigadier, come in, please. Greyhound Three, come in! Captain Yates, can you hear me, sir? Over.
It's no good. I just can't raise them. They must have copped it!
FARMER: What happened then?
SERGEANT: I don't know. Some sort of explosion.
FARMER: Ar, I heard it. Funny that. It was just about here where that doodlebug fell. Back in 1944, that were.
MASTER: You know, I thoroughly enjoyed that.
KRASIS: You have destroyed this, this Tardis?
MASTER: No, it can't be destroyed. But people can.
JO: Mike, are you all right?
BRIGADIER: Now, you take it easy, Mike. You've finished work for the day.
YATES: Sir, I
BRIGADIER: An ambulance is on its way.
DOCTOR: Jo, can you spare me a moment?
YATES: Sorry about the Tardis, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, don't worry, Captain. We'll soon have her on her feet again.
DOCTOR: Right, Jo, I want you to keep a close eye on this. As soon as you see the slightest reaction, you let me know.
JO: Right.
FARMER: One, two, six, heave! One, two, six, heave! Pull!
BENTON: Sir, I'll stand by. And I'm glad you're all okay, sir. We'd really thought you'd copped it. Greyhound
HYDE: It's a daft idea anyway. I've had one basinful and I don't feel much like walking into another. You heard what the Doctor said.
RUTH: You know, Stuart, for a so-called member of the dominant sex, you are being remarkable feeble.
BENTON: Hey, hey! Is this a private fight or can anyone join in?
RUTH: Boadicea here only wants to creep over to the lab and knobble the Master.
BENTON: Well, supposing the time field's still working?
HYDE: Exactly.
RUTH: Well we shan't know that till we try it, now shall we.
BENTON: Right then. What are we waiting for?
RUTH: Right!
HYDE: Oy, you're worse than she is.
BENTON: Oh, you're suggesting we just sit here and let the Master treat us as a load of twits, I suppose?
HYDE: Look, mate, you're paid to play the James Bond games. I'm a scientist.
RUTH: Stuart, really.
HYDE: Don't you start. You'd be the first to clobber me if I muck things up.
RUTH: Well, you might at least have a go. Oh, why are you men so spineless?
HYDE: Lovey, I'm not men. I'm Stuart Hyde, registered, card carrying, paid up coward. For Pete's sake, what are you looking at me like that for? All right, I'll come.
BENTON: Thanks, Stuart.
RUTH: Jolly good, Stu. I knew you wouldn't let us down.
HYDE: Just give me time, that's all. Well, come on then. What are we waiting for?
BENTON: Let's go.
MASTER: Come, Krasis. We have work to do.
KRASIS: Master, what is this place? Is it a temple?
MASTER: Do not let it concern you, Krasis.
KRASIS: So vast a space inside so small a box.
MASTER: My power is greater than your imagination can encompass. You just remember that. Your only interest at the moment is to realise that Atlantis awaits us. Now, test the power levels. Good. Just a few minutes re-cycling and we shall be ready to leave.
JO: I'm getting a reading.
DOCTOR: It's very low.
JO: Mmm, it's fading again.
DOCTOR: He must be testing before take off. The power drain would have been enormous. Brigadier?
BRIGADIER: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The Master seems to be on the move again.
BRIGADIER: Right, Sergeant, get the Doctor's machine loaded up.
DOCTOR: No, no, there's no time for that now. I'll have to take the Tardis off from down there. I'll use the time sensor as a homing device and put my Tardis inside his. Then wherever he goes, I'll go with him.
DOCTOR: Well, goodbye, Lethbridge Stewart.
BRIGADIER: Bye.
DOCTOR: I'll make contact as soon as possible.
JO: We'll make contact as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: We?
JO: We.
DOCTOR: Nothing I can say to dissuade you?
JO: No.
DOCTOR: Oh.
JO: Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yeah?
JO: The Tardis looks different.
DOCTOR: Oh, just a spot of redecoration, that's all. Now, Jo, you realise that what I'm about to do is going to be appallingly dangerous.
JO: I've been in the Tardis with you before.
DOCTOR: All right, but you've been warned.
JO: Shall I take your coat?
DOCTOR: Thank you. Right. Now then, come over here and look at this.
JO: Yeah, I'm coming.
DOCTOR: Now, the two Tardis's are operating on the same frequency, you see? Now here comes the tricky part. You see this?
JO: Yeah.
DOCTOR: This is the time setting. Now it's critical to a billionth part of a nanosecond, do you see?
JO: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now hold this.  If it's infinitesimally low, we'll miss it entirely and goes whistling off to heaven knows where. But if it's too high, even by a fraction of a moment, whumph! Time ram.
JO: Time ram?
DOCTOR: Yes. You see, the atoms making up this Tardis would occupy precisely the same space and time as the atoms making up the Master's Tardis.
JO: But that's impossible!
DOCTOR: Yes, well of course it is. So what do you think would happen?
JO: Whumph!
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Extinction. Utter annihilation. Now do you still want to come?
JO: It is my job, remember?
DOCTOR: Glad to have you aboard, Miss Grant.
JO: Glad to be aboard, Doctor!
FARMER: Londoners!
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Yes. Yes, so far, so good.
JO: How long's it going to take us to get there?
DOCTOR: Well, that's the curious thing. No time at all. We're outside time. Of course, it always seems to take a long time but that depends upon the mood, I suppose.
JO: What, your mood?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, hers. No, the Tardis's.
JO: You talk as if she was alive.
DOCTOR: It depends what you mean by alive, doesn't it. You take old Bessie, for instance. Right, coming in to land now, Jo.
DOCTOR: Steady.
JO: Look!
DOCTOR: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Still, that was always on the cards. I suppose.
JO: His Tardis is inside ours instead of, well, the other way round.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Very curious effect that. I wonder how it happened? Jo, switch on the monitor, will you? Let's see where we are.
DOCTOR: Well, that's strange. No, of course. We're seeing through the TOM-TIT gap into the time vortex. Jo, you wait right here.
DOCTOR: Good grief. Jo, come out here a moment, will you?
JO: I don't get it.
DOCTOR: No? Follow me.
JO: I still don't get it.
DOCTOR: Well, it's perfectly simple, Jo. My Tardis is inside the Master's.
JO: Yes, but his is inside yours.
DOCTOR: Exactly. They're both inside each other. Yeah, I should have suspected that.
JO: Well, what are we going to do now?
DOCTOR: Three guesses?
JO: Er, I wonder. Wait?
DOCTOR: Right first time!
KRASIS: Master!
KRASIS: Alien wagons!
MASTER: I'll soon fix them.
BRIGADIER: Right. B squad round the block. Keep your eyes open
MASTER: There. That'll keep them nicely unoccupied for the time being. Right, Krasis, in you go.
KRASIS: Where?
MASTER: Into the Tardis, man, and hurry up.
MASTER: Right, they won't stop me now.
RUTH: I'm sorry, Professor, but that's where you're wrong.
MASTER: Well, well, my devoted assistants. And are you going to stop me?
RUTH: Not by ourselves, no. Take a look behind you.
MASTER: Oh, come on, really.
BENTON: You suit yourself, mate, but let's just have those hands up in the air, shall we?
MASTER: I should have disposed of you while I had the chance.
BENTON: Yes, well, you'll never have a better one. Stu, see if he's got a gun.
BENTON: Stuart, look out!
HYDE: Oh no! 
KRASIS: Master! The other one is here. Your enemy is here.
MASTER: Good! Ha ha! Now I've got him really trapped.
HYDE: What the?
JO: What's happening, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We're on our way, Jo. The Master's taken off for Atlantis.
JO: She's never behaved like this before.
DOCTOR: It's because the Tardis is operating out of phase, that's why.
DOCTOR: That's calmed her down a bit. She's very temperamental when she's roused, isn't she.
JO: You know, I never know whether you're joking or not, I, Ow. Oh, I think I've bruised my tailbone.
DOCTOR: Sorry about your coccyx, Jo, but these little things are sent to try us.
JO: My what?
DOCTOR: Coccyx. Your tailbone.
MASTER : I'm sorry about your coccyx too, Miss Grant. How very sociable of you both to drop in.
BENTON: Well, I don't think we should touch it.
RUTH: Why ever not?
BENTON: Well, the Doctor was going after his Tardis, right?
RUTH: Right.
BENTON: Well, that thing there is a sort of time machine, isn't it?
RUTH: So what?
BENTON: So we'd better leave well alone.
RUTH: You're in command, Sergeant Benton.
BENTON: Yes.
HYDE: And a right foul up you made of it, too.
RUTH: Well, not exactly his fault.
HYDE: Well, don't look at me. You can't say I didn't warn you, now can you?
BENTON: Oh well, I'll listen to you next time. That was the closest I'll ever come to catching the Master, that was.
HYDE: Oh, come on now. It's not the end of the world, now is it?
BENTON: Isn't it? Well, the Doctor seems to think it might be. And the Master. Well, there's no telling where he is by now, is there? Or when he is, for that matter.
RUTH: Oh, for pity's sake. Look, you two make me sick. Standing about moaning like a couple of old women.
HYDE: Old women?
RUTH: Look, I mean it, Stu. Well, okay, he's gone off somewhere. So he's gone off. Whether he's gone into the past or the future
BENTON: All I know is we
RUTH: I don't know and, frankly, I don't care. The point is that we are here and now. Now, what we've got to do is to define the problem
BENTON: That's all very well, Miss Ingram, but I
HYDE: Stop right there, Professor. The problem's defined. Come and have a look.
BENTON: It's the Brigadier.
RUTH: Exactly the same as before.
HYDE: How can it be the same as before now that the crystal's gone?
RUTH: I think I remember the Doctor said it works independently, even without the crystal.
BENTON: Yes, but do you realise we're still trapped, inside.
RUTH: Now will you let me turn off the transmitter?
BENTON: Well, I don't think we ought to.
HYDE: Well, perhaps we could get out through the back. It may not work all the way round.
RUTH: I'll bet it does. How do you propose finding out? I mean, once you're stuck, you're stuck.
BENTON: Yes, and only the Doctor can get you out.
RUTH: Well?
BENTON: All right, Doctor Ingram. Switch it off.
RUTH: Ah ha! A man of decision. 
BENTON: Go on then, switch it off.
RUTH: But I have.
HYDE: They're still stuck.
RUTH: But that's impossible!
HYDE: Well, you'd better explain to them, lovey. They still think they're stuck, apparently.
BENTON: Yes, and we're still trapped in here.
MASTER : What can I do for you, Doctor? Or, er, is your visit purely social?
DOCTOR: Well, I thought we might have a little chat.
MASTER : What an excellent idea. Why not join me out here?
DOCTOR : One step outside my Tardis and that would be the end of me, wouldn't it?
MASTER: You have a very poor opinion of me, don't you, Doctor.
DOCTOR : You've noticed. Well, well, well.
MASTER: It might be of interest for you to know that, er, I've put a time lock on your Tardis. You cannot leave. Unless I lift it, of course.
DOCTOR : Do you think that I haven't thought of that too? You're as trapped as I am. You couldn't even open that door of yours unless I wish it.
MASTER: Alternatively, I could fling you out into the time vortex now. I doubt whether you could do that to me, so be very, very careful, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Do you really think I care what happens to me at the moment? Don't you realise that your plans could ru
MASTER: You know, he has an excellent brain, that man, though a little pedestrian. But, oh dear, what a bore the fellow is.
KRASIS: But is he dangerous?
MASTER: He's dangerous enough. But don't worry. I can handle him.
KRASIS: But you said he was in there! You told me he was safe in there!
MASTER: Once he realises that he's talking to himself, he'll be out here like a shot. Ah! He's realised it at last. That took a long time, the slow witted fool. Now you watch. He cannot bear not to have the last word.
DOCTOR: He's not even listening. He's turned the sound off.
JO: Well, that's not very nice, is it?
DOCTOR: We've got to make him listen. It's our only chance of stopping him.
JO: You're not thinking of going out there, are you?
DOCTOR: No, not if I can help it.
JO: Well, what are you going to do then?
DOCTOR: If he's turned his sound receiver off, I must make myself heard without it.
DOCTOR: If the thraskin puts his fingers in his ears, it is polite to shout. That's an old Venusian proverb.
JO: What's a thraskin?
DOCTOR: Thraskin? Oh, it's an archaic word, seldom used since the twenty fifth dynasty, the modern equivalent is plinge.
JO: What does plinge mean?
DOCTOR: Oh, for heaven's sake, Jo, I've just told you. It means thraskin.
JO: Oh, of course.
BENTON: But why? I mean, if you turned it on, the Brig and company should have speeded up again. Why didn't they?
RUTH: Well, I don't know but it looks as if TOM-TIT has made a permanent gap in the structure of time. Our only hope is to close the gap up.
HYDE: So what are you doing?
RUTH: Well, I'm turning the circuits upside down, so to speak. Well, it's empirical, but you never know.
BENTON: Empirical?
RUTH: That, Sergeant Benton, means that I haven't got a clue what I'm doing.
HYDE: Join the club.
BENTON: So, it's just trial and error? Have a go and see what happens?
RUTH: Yeah, more or less. Right, Stu, you monitor the interstitial activity.
HYDE: Okay.
RUTH: If you get a reading over six oh give us a shout.
HYDE: And what's the upper limit?
RUTH: If it gets to seven oh, say a quick prayer and duck.
BENTON: Well, what about me?
RUTH: You just stand there and look pretty. Right, Stu, are you happy?
BENTON: Ecstatic.
RUTH: Okay then, let's have a stab at it.
HYDE: Interstitial activity, nil.
RUTH: Molecular structure stable. Increasing power.
HYDE: Two five, three oh, three five, four oh.
RUTH: How's the time reg?
HYDE: Er, steady on zero zero four.
RUTH: Right. Isolate matrix scanner.
HYDE: Check. Four five, five oh.
RUTH: Interstitial activity.
HYDE: Shooting up! Five five, six oh, six five, seven oh.
RUTH: Can't hold! It's running away again! Start decreasing power.
HYDE: Seven five, seven oh, six five, six oh, five five, five oh, four five, four oh, three five, three oh.
RUTH: Right, that should be enough. I think the level should be okay now.
HYDE: Quite okay, I'd say.
RUTH: Right, now let's have a look at it.
RUTH: It's made no difference. They're still stuck.
HYDE: There we were, the skin of a gnat's whisker from the big bang and
RUTH: And nothing happened at all.
HYDE: Nothing?
KRASIS: Master, what is he doing?
MASTER: The same as I would in his position.
KRASIS: And what is that?
MASTER: Wait and see, Krasis. Wait and see.
KRASIS: And what are you going to do, Master?
DOCTOR : Testing, testing, testing. One, two, three, four, five, testing.
JO : He can hear you.
MASTER: I thought as much.
DOCTOR : Yes, and he can't turn me off, can you? You've got to listen to me now.
MASTER: Have I?
DOCTOR : Obviously, you've not as yet been able to bring Kronos through, otherwise you wouldn't be going to Atlantis, so perhaps there's still time to make you realise the folly of your
DOCTOR: Inyups senupwat. Neas nees nig datdat sig. Ilshnimuwat ijnilguin nyup nyp
MASTER : I'm sorry, Doctor. What was that again?
DOCTOR: Il shneel nukcusnok drashtarnik dag. Of all the low, underhanded tricks!
JO: What language was that?
DOCTOR: English.
JO: English?
DOCTOR: Yes, but backwards.
JO: I just don't get it.
DOCTOR: Well, he's picking up my words even before I've spoken them and feeding them back to me through the Tardis's telepathic circuits, making them come out backwards.
JO: The Tardis's are telepathic?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. How else do you think they communicate? Well, that decides it. I've got no option. Now listen to me, Jo. When I go out there, I want you to
JO: You're not going out there.
DOCTOR: What else can I do?
JO: Doctor, you said yourself it would be suicide to go out there without the protection of the Tardis!
DOCTOR: Well, I've got to risk it. He's got to be stopped, but that's no reason to put you into any danger. Now once I go out of that door, I want you to close it, all right?
JO: But that means you'll be locked out!
DOCTOR: Yes, and you'll be safely locked in. Now, you're not to open that door for anybody or anything until I say so.
JO: I won't do it. I will not do it!
DOCTOR: Jo, you'll do as you're told! It's your job, remember?
JO: Doctor, if anything happens to you, I
DOCTOR: Yes, I know, Jo, I know. Now go and open that door.
MASTER: There you are, Krasis. What did I tell you?
DOCTOR: Won't you introduce me?
KRASIS: I am Krasis, High Priest of the temple of Poseidon.
DOCTOR: Greetings to you, Krasis. Any friend of the Master's is an enemy of mine.
MASTER: Oh come, Doctor, must we play games? I take it you have something to say to me before I destroy you?
DOCTOR: Yes, I most certainly have.
MASTER : Your usual song of death and disaster? I do wish you'd learn a new tune.
DOCTOR: You're risking the total destruction of the entire cosmos.
MASTER: Of course I am. All or nothing, literally! What a glorious alternative!
DOCTOR: You're mad! Paranoid!
MASTER: Who isn't? The only difference is that I'm a little more honest than the rest. Goodbye, Doctor!
KRASIS: No, Master, no!
MASTER: Behold, Kronos, a rare and delicate feast for you. A Time Lord! Devour him!
JO: Doctor!
MASTER: Kronos, be at peace! I command you, be at peace!
MASTER: Your work is nearly done, for now. You see, Krasis? Kronos is my slave.
MASTER: Miss Grant?
JO : What's happened to the Doctor? You must help him!
MASTER: Ah, he's beyond my help, my dear. He's beyond anybody's help.
JO : You mean that thing, that, that creature really swallowed him up?
MASTER: Ah, that's a nice point. Yes and no. Yes, it engulfed him. No, it didn't actually eat him up. He's out there in the time vortex and there he's going to stay.
JO : Then he is alive?
MASTER: Well, if you can call it that. Alive for ever in an eternity of nothingness. To coin a phrase, a living death.
JO : That that's the most cruel, the most wicked thing I ever heard.
MASTER: Thank you, my dear. Now, what are we going to do about you, though? You're an embarrassment to me. As indeed is that antiquated piece of junk of the Doctor's. Now let me see
JO : I don't really care anymore. Do what you like, but just get it over with.
MASTER: Your word is my command. Goodbye, Miss Grant!
Episode Five
JO: Doctor.
DOCTOR : Jo. Jo, are you in there?
JO: Doctor? Oh, it is you.
DOCTOR : Thank heavens you're alive.
JO: Oh, I'm so happy. Where are you?
DOCTOR : I'm nowhere, Jo. I'm still in the time vortex. The Tardis is relaying my thoughts to you.
JO: What are all those other voices I can hear?
DOCTOR : What other voices? Oh. Oh, those are my subconscious thoughts. But I shouldn't listen to them too hard if I were you. I'm not all that proud of some of them.
JO: But I still don't understand? But you must be somewhere. Tell me how I can get you back?
DOCTOR : Oh, you can't, Jo, but luckily the Tardis can. That's why she's put us in touch.
JO: But what do you? I mean, what does she want me to do?
DOCTOR : Well, go to control panel number three.
JO: Okay.
DOCTOR : Now, lift the little lid marked Extreme Emergency.
JO: Right.
DOCTOR : The one with the red handle inside?
JO: Mmm hm.
DOCTOR : All right, Jo. Pull it.
DOCTOR: Hello, Jo.
JO: Doctor!
ATLANTEAN 1: Open the doors!
ATLANTEAN 2: Open the doors!
CRITO: Peace, my brothers. His holiness, the most venerable priest of Poseidon, King of the Ten Kings, will hear his council.
HIPPIAS: My lord, your holiness, most venerable priest of
DALIOS: Yes, yes, yes, I hear you, friend.
HIPPIAS: Lord, may I speak plainly?
DALIOS: It would grieve me to think you would ever speak otherwise. Speak as a friend should speak.
HIPPIAS: You are popular, Dalios. The people love you. Will their love fill their bellies in the winter when the granaries are empty?
DALIOS: Your words are plain indeed, Hippias. What would you have me do? Order the rain to fall?
HIPPIAS: Aye, Dalios, I would!
MISEUS: Hippias!
DALIOS: Have a care!
HIPPIAS: Indeed, I shall have a care! A care for the people of Atlantis. A care that foolish superstition, old wives tales, the fear of old men should not prevent our caring for them as our rank demands.
MISEUS: He speaks the truth, o King.
DALIOS: You know not what you ask.
HIPPIAS: Must I be plainer still? I know quite well! I ask for the blessings our forefathers once enjoyed. I ask for the divine power to be given back to the land, from which it was so cruelly stolen!
KRASIS: But, Master, why are we not in Atlantis?
MASTER: My dear Krasis, I must work out our landing coordinates as accurately as possible. You see, your people must realise immediately that I am the Master, that I come from the gods and that I am bringing Kronos back to them.
KRASIS: Where then will you arrive?
MASTER: Why smack in the middle of the temple, of course.
DALIOS: Brothers, silence! Peace! Peace, I say. I shall speak plainly too. You ask for the blessings of the golden years. Yet there came a time when Atlantis grew to hate them. What would you have, Hippias? If you were master of Kronos, lord of time. Ten crops in one season? A surfeit of fishes? An ocean of wine? Then take the barren soil as well, the stinking piles of rotting meat, an idle drunken people. I tell you Kronos was a curse!
HIPPIAS: But Dalios, I
CRITO: Be silent! The King speaks!
DALIOS: I have seen a temple twice the size of this fall through a crack in the very bedrock of the earth. I have seen a city drowned, a land laid waste by fire, so listen to the fears of an old man. For I tell you, if Kronos came again, Atlantis would be doomed, destroyed, never to rise again!
GALLEIA: Dalios, listen. I hear strange music.
GALLEIA: There it is again.
GALLEIA: Look!
DALIOS: Guards!
DALIOS: Who are you?
MASTER: I am the Master. I come as an emissary from the gods.
DALIOS: Indeed? Any god in particular?
MASTER: Of course, why should you trust me.
CRITO: Krasis!
DALIOS: Krasis!
MASTER: Now do you believe me?
DALIOS: What do you want?
MASTER: To speak of the ancient mysteries. The secrets of the mighty Kronos.
DALIOS: You are brave indeed, o Master. An emissary from the gods? Brothers, should I listen to this man?
GALLEIA: He has the very bearing of a god himself.
MISEUS: He appeared from the heavens like Zeus.
DALIOS: I have seen many such tricks. Krasis?
KRASIS: Most venerable, I have seen him! I have seen the Mighty One!
DALIOS: You have seen Kronos? We must speak together privately. The council is at an end. Come, lady.
CRITO: The council is at an end. The king departs. Sound trumpets!
GALLEIA: He had the bearing of the gods.
DOCTOR: There we are, Jo. On our way to Atlantis.
JO: But you can't just take the Tardis wherever you want, can you? I mean, you haven't even managed to fix it yet? Or have you?
DOCTOR: No, not entirely, but the time sensor will lead us to where the Master's Tardis is.
JO: But not inside it?
DOCTOR: No, I hope not. Not this time. But we'll soon find out.
HIPPIAS: But, Krasis, I beseech you. Please give me the chance
DOCTOR: Well, well, well. Isn't it a small world.
KRASIS: You are still alive?
DOCTOR: Yes, so it would seem.
KRASIS: But not for long. Guards!
HIPPIAS: No! I forbid it! Are you mad? Who are these strangers?
KRASIS: They are the enemies of the Master, and therefore the enemies of our people and our land.
DOCTOR: We've come here to warn you that
KRASIS: Silence! You will regret this interference, Lord. Take them to the King!
GUARD: Come, this way.
DALIOS: But if the high priest saw fit to break a scared trust, you think that good reason for the king to follow?
MASTER: Your high priest saw the crystal in my hands. He saw Kronos himself, saw him dominated by me. Krasis knows that I am the Master of Kronos.
DALIOS: Krasis is but a slave at heart.
MASTER: Maybe, but he has come to learn that it is well to obey me.
DALIOS: You seek to make me fear you?
MASTER: Oh, not at all. But if you will but see, like Krasis, that I am indeed the Master of Kronos, then naturally you will obey me.
MASTER: You will obey me. You will obey me!
DALIOS: A very elementary technique of fascination. I'm too old a fish, too old in years and in the hidden ways to be caught in such a net. You are no emissary from the gods.
MASTER: But you saw
DALIOS: Tell me, then. What of great Poseidon? What did he have for breakfast? Fish, I suppose? And what of Zeus and Hera? What is the latest gossip from Olympus? Do tell me.
MASTER: I underestimated you, Dalios.
DALIOS: I'm no child to play with such painted dolls. Kronos is no god, no titan. I know that and so do you.
MASTER: The king is old in wisdom.
DALIOS: Now you try to flatter me. You'll pull a string and want to see me dance. You shall not have the crystal.
MASTER: I shall go now. I have nothing more to say to you.
DALIOS: You have said nothing to me yet. When you find the true words to speak, I will listen.
DOCTOR: Good afternoon. Now where have I seen that face before? Can't think of anything to say?
JO: How about curses, foiled again.
HIPPIAS: Come this way.
DALIOS: Strangers are uncommon in our land. Who are you?
DOCTOR: This is Jo, Jo Grant, your Majesty.
DALIOS: You are welcome, Jojo Grant. Surely as in ancient times, a goddess has descend from Olympus.
JO: But I'm not a goddess, Honestly, I'm not.
DALIOS: No, no, of course you're not, my child. Forgive the clumsy gallantry of an old man. I'm afraid I'm sadly out of practice. Hippias?
HIPPIAS: Lord?
DALIOS: Take the lady Jojo Grant to the Queen while I talk with this, er
JO: Oh, this is the Doctor.
DALIOS: This learned man.
HIPPIAS: This way, Lady.
DOCTOR: You'll be all right.
DALIOS: Forgive the roughness of your welcome. Hippias has all the delicacy of a red necked fisherman.
DOCTOR: Nevertheless, he did save our lives, your Majesty.
DALIOS: Indeed? He kept that to himself.
GALLEIA: But what did you think of him, Lakis?
LAKIS: He had the bearing of a god, Lady.
GALLEIA: My very thoughts. In fact, my very words. Are you teasing me, girl? Would you dare?
LAKIS: No, Lady, no.
GALLEIA: No, I hardly think you would. Are you frightened? I shan't be angered by your reply if it is an honest one.
LAKIS: I like the Lord Hippias better.
GALLEIA: A sweetmeat. A confection for a child's taste. I prefer this Master. He would not cloy upon the tongue as Hippias does.
LAKIS: He is a very handsome man, Lady.
GALLEIA: Handsome? Aye, he looked well enough. But his face, Lakis, it was a face of power. A man with such a face would dare risk the world to win his own desire. Hippias is but a boy. A petulant boy.
HIPPIAS: And a foolish one, no doubt, to trust a queen.
GALLEIA: Foolish, certainly, to think himself man enough to love a queen. No, Lakis, come back. The Lord Hippias is not staying.
HIPPIAS: The Lord Hippias would not be here at all, but he has been sent on an errand by the King.
GALLEIA: Then give me your message and go.
HIPPIAS: Lady? I did my best.
GALLEIA: He made you look a fool.
HIPPIAS: Lady Galleia, may I present to you the lady Jojo Grant. The King bids you treat her as an honoured guest.
JO: How do you? Greetings.
GALLEIA: Greetings, Lady. You come from a far land?
JO: It couldn't be much further.
HIPPIAS: She and her companion fell from the skies, as did the Master.
GALLEIA: A day of wonders.
JO: You can say that again.
GALLEIA: Why should I say it again? Lakis? Show the Lady Jojo Grant
JO: Oh, it's just Jo, actually.
GALLEIA: Your pardon. Show the Lady Jo to a guest room, and give her attire more fitting to a lady of the court.
LAKIS: Yes, Lady.
JO: Thank you.
LAKIS: This way.
GALLEIA: And Lakis? Return quickly. I have an errand for you.
LAKIS: Yes, Lady.
HIPPIAS: And none for me to run? A flower perhaps? A token of undying love to some lordling of the court? But no, it would be dead before it were delivered.
GALLEIA: You are impertinent! Remember, I am Galleia, Queen of Atlantis, daughter of kings and wife of Dalios. So, have a care.
HIPPIAS: Your pardon. I took you for another. I knew Galleia once, you see. The woman, not the queen. A sweet and loving lady. I took you for her. Please do forgive me.
GALLEIA: You may go.
HIPPIAS: I thank you, Lady.
GALLEIA: Lakis? Lakis, come to me at once.
GALLEIA: Come closer. Go to the Lord Master, and when no one is near, say quietly to him only one word.
LAKIS: What word, Lady?
GALLEIA: Kronos.
DALIOS: Kronos. Kronos. Kronos. I am the last alive who has known, who has seen, who remembers with a terror of twisted guts. And these fools would have me bring him back.
DOCTOR: Well, why didn't you destroy the crystal?
DALIOS: We tried and merely split the smaller crystal from it. It cannot be destroyed.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It's just like the Tardis. It has its being outside time and its appearance is here.
DALIOS: You are a philosopher, friend.
DOCTOR: Well, if wisdom is to seek the truth, I am, yes.
DALIOS: Then help me, Doctor. Help me to find a way to stop these evil men. Help me to save Atlantis from destruction.
MASTER: Where is she?
LAKIS: If you will please wait, Lord.
MASTER: The Master waits for no one. I shall return when the Queen is ready to speak with me.
GALLEIA: Please stay. Lord, great Lord, be seated. The wine, Lakis.
GALLEIA: You may go. Minister to the needs of our guest.
MASTER: Lady Queen, you are beautiful.
JO: Wow, what a groovy dress. Do you reckon it'll get mum's approval?
LAKIS: Mum? Oh, you mean Queen Galleia?
JO: Yeah, guess so.
LAKIS: Mum.
JO: Anyway, let's go and give her a preview.
LAKIS: No, I'm sorry. She does not wish to be disturbed. The Lord Master is with her.
JO: Is he now?
LAKIS: They speak of the sacred mysteries.
JO: Kronos and all that bit?
LAKIS: It is forbidden.
JO: But that is what they're on about?
LAKIS: Yes.
JO: Right.
LAKIS: No, you mustn't go in. You mustn't!
JO: Look, I'll be quiet as a. Do they have mice in Atlantis?
LAKIS: Yes.
JO: Well, that's what I'll be as quiet as. An Atlantean mouse, okay?
GALLEIA: You're a man who knows what he wants, Lord Master.
MASTER: And takes it.
GALLEIA: You want the crystal?
MASTER: I am going to possess it.
GALLEIA: Not without my consent.
MASTER: Of course not. But I am confident that you will give it.
GALLEIA: Why should I help you?
MASTER: For the sake of Atlantis, Lady. Would you not see her restored to her former glory? Rich, powerful, magnificent among the nations of the world? Who would not be ruler of such a country?
GALLEIA: Nothing must happen to Dalios.
MASTER: Why should it? He will rule for many years, the beloved sovereign of a beloved prosperous people.
GALLEIA: But surely you would want to
MASTER: Well, purely because of Lord Dalios' great age, it might be well if he were relieved of some of the more onerous duties of kingship. But the reins of power, Lady Queen, should be in stronger hands. Hands such as yours.
GALLEIA: And yours?
MASTER: It would be a pleasure to serve you. And then, when the end comes for Dalios, as it must come for all men, then perhaps?
GALLEIA: The crystal shall be yours.
MASTER : Tell me. Where is it kept?
GALLEIA: Deep in the earth. Beneath the temple. Dalios has the key. Oh, and Krasis has the key.
MASTER: Well then, Krasis will take me there. I'll speak with him immediately.
GALLEIA: I wish it were as simple as that. No one can get near, save Dalios himself. It's certain death to try.
MASTER: What is the danger?
GALLEIA: The guardian.
DOCTOR: Yes, but who is the guardian?
DALIOS: A beast. A man. You can take your choice. Once he was my friend, a fellow councillor, a great athlete, and just as I longed for the wisdom the years alone could bring, so he craved great strength. The strength of the bull and a long life in which to use it.
DOCTOR: Well, it's a harmless enough ambition, I should have thought?
DALIOS: So should I. But Kronos in his blind sport gave him his desire. But not only the strength, the head of a bull. And so he has remained for the past five hundred years or more.
DOCTOR: He's the minotaur.
DALIOS: Please?
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter. Please go on.
DALIOS: Well, there's little more to tell. No one else shall suffer as he has suffered. Till the last day of his life, for which he longs so ardently, he will guard the crystal. No one can approach it. To try is certain death.
MASTER: Would you like to volunteer, Krasis?
KRASIS: No, Lord, no!
GALLEIA: Very well then. We shall send one down who is mighty with the sword, and who longs with all his heart to seize the crystal. One whose death would be of little account.
KRASIS: But who, Lady?
GALLEIA: Hippias, of course.
LAKIS: What can we do? What can we do?
JO: We'll tell the Doctor, that's what we can do. Now, take me to the King.
LAKIS: Oh, I dare not, Lady Jo.
JO: Would you rather let your precious Hippias face that creature?
LAKIS: Oh well, come quickly, then.
LAKIS: This way.
GUARD: Halt!
JO: Take me to the King.
CRITO: The King is not to be disturbed.
JO: But I've got to see the Doctor! It's a matter of life and death!
CRITO: Indeed it is. Yours.
JO: Will you hear what I've got to say?
LAKIS: Come away.
JO:  What's the matter?
LAKIS:  Have a care. The Lord Crito is no friend to Hippias.
JO:  But
JO: Right, they're going now. I'll follow them. You try to get in and tell the Doctor, and the King for that matter. All right? Now take care.
JO: No!
JO: No, Hippias! Don't go in there!
JO: Open the door and let me out!
Episode Six
DALIOS: What is it?
CRITO : Come back!
LAKIS: Forgive me, Lord King, forgive me!
DALIOS: Tell us, child.
CRITO: Your pardon, Lord.
LAKIS: Lord Hippias and the High Priest have gone into the lair of the Guardian followed by the Lady Jo! DOCTOR: What?
KRASIS: Seize this intruder!
DOCTOR: Sorry to hold you up like this, Krasis, but I need that key.
DOCTOR: Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo, where are you?
HIPPIAS: Stay back!
DOCTOR: Toro!
JO: Doctor, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Look out, Jo!
JO: Hippias! He saved my life.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid he's dead, Jo. The crystal! It's the crystal of Kronos!
DOCTOR: There you, Jo. That's what all the fuss has been about.
JO: It's beautiful, but at the same time, horrible. It gives me a funny feeling.
DOCTOR: Well, cheer up, Jo. Now that we've found the crystal, the Master's little game is at an end.
KRASIS: Not quite! The game is just beginning. A pity you will not live to see the end.
DOCTOR: That's where you're mistaken, Krasis. And if you value your own life, you will take me to see the King. Now!
MASTER: But I am the King. Oh, didn't he tell you? Oh, he's a jolly fellow, our friend, Krasis. He loves a joke.
DOCTOR: Does he really?
MASTER: A complete success, our little palace revolution.
DOCTOR: What happened to King Dalios?
MASTER: Why, nothing.
DOCTOR: Then he's still alive?
MASTER: Why, certainly. And treated honourably.
GALLEIA: Even though Dalios is an old man, the King is still the King.
MASTER: And now it appears that I have to thank you both.
JO: What for?
MASTER: For giving me the crystal.
DOCTOR: You don't mean to say that you still intend going ahead with this
MASTER: Tomorrow you will both receive a suitable reward. An introduction to the mighty Kronos. And this time, Doctor, there will be no mistake.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't count on that.
MASTER: Right, Lady, I have a lot to do so you must leave me too.
GALLEIA: Must I indeed.
MASTER: You would question my decision?
GALLEIA: Perhaps. It depends what you mean to do.
MASTER: You must learn to obey, my love. To do my will. To carry out my commands without question, like a soldier.
GALLEIA: You mean like a servant girl? And you must learn, my love, that Galleia is a Queen.
DOCTOR: Any luck?
JO: Funnily enough, they didn't include Atlantean chains in my escapology course. No, it's no good. Doctor, what are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Well, we'll just have to play it by ear, won't we.
JO: What happens if the Master wins?
DOCTOR: Well, the whole of creation is very delicately balanced in cosmic terms, Jo. If the Master opens the floodgates of Kronos' power, all order and all structure will be swept away, and nothing will be left but chaos.
JO: Makes it seem so pointless really, doesn't it.
DOCTOR: I felt like that once when I was young. It was the blackest day of my life.
JO: Why?
DOCTOR: Ah, well, that's another story. I'll tell you about it one day. The point is, that day was not only my blackest, it was also my best.
JO: Well, what do you mean?
DOCTOR: Well, when I was a little boy, we used to live in a house that was perched halfway up the top of a mountain. And behind our house, there sat under a tree an old man, a hermit, a monk. He'd lived under this tree for half his lifetime, so they said, and he'd learned the secret of life. So, when my black day came, I went and asked him to help me.
JO: And he told you the secret? Well, what was it?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm coming to that, Jo, in my own time. Ah, I'll never forget what it was like up there. All bleak and cold, it was. A few bare rocks with some weeds sprouting from them and some pathetic little patches of sludgy snow. It was just grey. Grey, grey, grey. Well, the tree the old man sat under, that was ancient and twisted and the old man himself was, he was as brittle and as dry as a leaf in the autumn.
JO: But what did he say?
DOCTOR: Nothing, not a word. He just sat there, silently, expressionless, and he listened whilst I poured out my troubles to him. I was too unhappy even for tears, I remember. And when I'd finished, he lifted a skeletal hand and he pointed. Do you know what he pointed at?
JO: No.
DOCTOR: A flower. One of those little weeds. Just like a daisy, it was. Well, I looked at it for a moment and suddenly I saw it through his eyes. It was simply glowing with life, like a perfectly cut jewel. And the colours? Well, the colours were deeper and richer than you could possibly imagine. Yes, that was the daisiest daisy I'd ever seen.
JO: And that was the secret of life? A daisy? Honestly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I laughed too when I first heard it. So, later, I got up and I ran down that mountain and I found that the rocks weren't grey at all, but they were red, brown and purple and gold. And those pathetic little patches of sludgy snow, they were shining white. Shining white in the sunlight. You still frightened, Jo?
JO: No, not as much as I was.
DOCTOR: That's good. I'm sorry I brought you to Atlantis.
JO: I'm not.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
GUARD: Inside, old man!
DALIOS: I demand to be taken to the Lady Galleia!
GUARD: You'll do as you're told.
DALIOS: How dare you lay your hands on me! I shall see the Queen! Out of my way, slave!
DOCTOR: Dalios! Dalios!
DALIOS: Who would have thought it. My sweet Queen.
DOCTOR: Is the Master responsible for this?
DALIOS: Aye, but tis no matter. Come closer.
DOCTOR: What is it?
DALIOS: There's so little time. So little. I tell you the vision of a dying man. Atlantis was doomed. You are a true philosopher. The world must be, must be saved. And you are the one to do it. The only one. Who'd have thought it? My lovely Galleia.
DOCTOR: Dalios! We won't fail you, Dalios.
CRITO: Silence! The Lady Galleia, Queen of Atlantis, now speaks.
GALLEIA: Brethren of the council, my faithful few. Our troubles are now at an end. No longer shall we fret beneath the hand of an old, defeated king. I shall present to you his holiness, the most venerable, Lord Master.
DOCTOR: Quite above himself, isn't he.
CRITO: Silence!
MASTER: Greetings to you, my brothers. I grieve to see the council is so small. And yet I rejoice that you, the few who have put me here, have come to claim your just reward. Today, you shall see the Mighty One himself. Kronos, the most terrible. Krasis, the high priest will assist me. Prepare, Krasis.
DOCTOR: What happened to the rest of the council?
JO: Yes, where are they?
DOCTOR: Are they alive?
MASTER: The point is academic, Doctor. In a few moments, it'll be of no further interest to you.
DOCTOR: Then satisfy my curiosity now. Are they indeed alive, or are they dead like King Dalios?
GALLEIA: The King is unharmed.
DOCTOR: The King is dead, Madame.
JO: It's true. We were there when he died this morning.
GALLEIA: You were there? You saw him? Is this true? Is this true? Is the lord Dalios, your King, no longer alive? Answer me.
MASTER: He died this morning. He was an old man.
DOCTOR: And you were responsible for his death!
GUARD: Quiet!
GALLEIA: You promised.
MASTER: I promised you power, and you shall have it. Power to realise your most ambitious dreams!
GALLEIA: You promised he should not be harmed!
MASTER: He was an old man. And he was stubborn!
GALLEIA: Oh, you! Seize him! Seize him!
MASTER: Krasis, the switch!
DOCTOR: No, stop him! Stop him!
MASTER: Kronos! I, the Master, welcome you! I, the Master, bid you do my will! I command you to destroy these men! Obey me! I command you! I order you to obey!
DOCTOR: He'll never obey you. Don't you understand yet what you've done? He's uncontrollable!
MASTER: Obey!
DOCTOR: Jo! Jo, come back! Jo! Jo!
DOCTOR: Come back, Jo! Come back! Jo! Come back. 
MASTER: There, Miss Grant. I think we've seen the last of the Doctor. Buried for all time under the ruins of Atlantis. You know, I'm going to miss him.
JO: He's not finished. I just know it.
MASTER: Of course he is.
JO: No, you're the one who's finished! Do you think that, that creature out there will ever let you control it?
MASTER: I do so already. He came when I called. You saw that yourself.
JO: Like a tiger comes when he hears a lamb bleating.
MASTER: Nicely put, my dear. You know, that was worthy of the late lamented Doctor himself. You know, I could kick myself for not having polished him off long ago. Just think of the future. Dominion over all time and all space. Absolute power forever. And no Doctor to ruin things for me.
DOCTOR : Don't worry, Jo.
JO: Doctor!
DOCTOR : I'll soon sort him out for you.
MASTER: Doctor! Why, you must be as indestructible as that wretched Tardis of yours! And how exactly do you propose to sort me out?
DOCTOR : By making you see reason, and making you destroy that crystal.
MASTER: Oh? Why should I? I have my Tardis, I have Kronos and I have Miss Grant. Now, my reason tells me that I hold all the cards.
DOCTOR : Ah, but there's one card that you've forgotten.
MASTER: Oh?
DOCTOR : The trump card. I can stop you whenever I please.
MASTER: You are bluffing, Doctor.
DOCTOR : Am I? How about time ram?
MASTER: Time ram? You couldn't do it in that old crock.
DOCTOR : The two Tardis's are operating on the same frequency, and our controls are locked together. See for yourself.
MASTER: Stop!
DOCTOR : You know what'll happen if that control goes over the safety limit, don't you. Tell him, Jo.
JO: The two Tardis's occupy exactly the same space and time, and that means that you go
MASTER: I know very well what it means.
DOCTOR : Do you?
MASTER: Yes! Oblivion.
DOCTOR : Top of the class. Extinction, total annihilation, for you, the Tardis and the crystal.
MASTER: And for you and Miss Grant.
DOCTOR : Oh yes, of course. But by then, Kronos will be free, and the universe will be saved.
MASTER: Very well. Go ahead.
DOCTOR : What?
MASTER: Go ahead. Time ram!
JO: You can't be serious?
MASTER: Do you think I'm going to dance to the Doctor's tune like some performing poodle? Look, Doctor, you want to stop me? Try!
DOCTOR : Very well. Goodbye, Jo.
MASTER: Well? Why have you stopped?
DOCTOR : To give you one last chance.
MASTER: Nonsense! You can't bring yourself to destroy her. Now admit it! It's that fatal weakness of yours, Doctor. Pity, compassion. You know, for a moment there, you almost had me believing you.
JO: Don't listen to him, Doctor! Think of all those millions of people who'll die. Think of all those millions of people who'll never be born. Do it, Doctor, quickly!
DOCTOR : But Jo, there may be another way.
MASTER: Of course there is. The way to immeasurable glory! JO: Goodbye, Doctor!
MASTER: No!
DOCTOR : Don't do it!
JO: Too late!
MASTER: No!
JO: Doctor.
JO: Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR: Jo. Are you all right?
JO: I'm fine. Dead, of course, but I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Dead? What are you talking about? You're no more dead than I am.
JO: Well, that's just it. Well, I mean, that's what I mean. I mean, you're dead too, and so's the Master.
DOCTOR: And I suppose we're all in heaven?
JO: Yeah, or somewhere. Hey, come take a look. Come on.
JO: Groovy, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, it's fascinating, but somehow I don't think we're in heaven.
JO: Well, where are we then?
DOCTOR: Well, that's just it. I don't know myself. You shouldn't have put us into time ram, Jo. In any case, I was just about to do it myself.
JO: Oh, really?
DOCTOR: Now look, Jo, I. No, not really.
DOCTOR: Greetings.
KRONOS: Your courtesy is always so punctilious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You know me?
KRONOS: Of old.
DOCTOR: Well, you must forgive me, but I can't quite place you.
KRONOS: I am Kronos.
JO: You? But you're a girl.
KRONOS: Shapes mean nothing.
JO: But a little while ago you were a raging monster and an evil destroyer.
KRONOS: I can be all things. A destroyer, a healer, a creator. I'm beyond good and evil as you know it.
DOCTOR: Where exactly are we?
KRONOS: On the boundary of your reality and mine. You brought yourselves here.
DOCTOR: Yes, the time ram.
KRONOS: At the moment of impact, I was released. That saved you and took you to the threshold of being.
DOCTOR: Well, what now?
KRONOS: I owe you a debt of gratitude nothing could repay. What would you wish?
JO: To go home.
DOCTOR: In the Tardis.
KRONOS: You shall.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
JO: But what about the Master?
KRONOS: He stays.
JO: And what will happen to him?
KRONOS: Torment, of course. The pain he has given so freely will be returned to him, in full.
MASTER: No!
MASTER: Doctor, please. Please help me. I can't bear it. Please, Doctor, please.
DOCTOR: Mighty Kronos, may I ask one last favour of you?
KRONOS: Name it.
DOCTOR: His life. His freedom.
KRONOS: He made a prisoner of me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. But would you allow us to deal with him in our way?
KRONOS: I do not understand you, but if that is your desire, so let it be.
MASTER: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Don't thank me. You're coming back to Earth with us.
MASTER: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: No! No! Kronos, stop him! Stop him, Kronos!
KRONOS: You asked for him to be given his freedom. He has it.
JO: Here we go again.
HYDE: Come on, baby Benton. Come on, get it down you.
RUTH: What are you feeding him on now?
HYDE: The remains of my lunchtime sandwiches mashed up with some cold tea.
RUTH: Stop playing mothers and fathers and come and give me a hand. I think I'm nearly there.
HYDE: What are you trying to do?
RUTH: Well, if I'm on the beam, we should be able to close the gap in time for good. Right, switch on, Stu.
HYDE: Okay.
JO: But, why? I mean, why did you even ask?
DOCTOR: Jo, would you condemn anybody to an eternity of torment? Even the Master?
JO: No. No, I guess I wouldn't.
DOCTOR: No. Well, neither would I. Even though he was responsible for the destruction of Atlantis.
JO: It's so terrible though, when you think about it. All those people.
DOCTOR: Yes. Right, Jo, we're about to land back in Cambridge. Just think. It all happened three thousand, five hundred years ago.
HYDE: Three oh, three five, four oh.
HYDE: Suffering catfish!
RUTH: Increasing power.
HYDE: But Ruth, look!
RUTH: Yes, it must be the Doctor. Now concentrate, Stu. Increasing power.
HYDE: Four five, five oh.
RUTH: Isolate matrix scanner.
HYDE: Five five. Check.
DOCTOR: What's going on here?
HYDE: Six oh, six five, seven oh.
RUTH: See if it's working, Stu.
HYDE: Hey. Yes, it is.
RUTH: Good.
DOCTOR: It seems to be working a bit too well.
RUTH: It's running away again.
HYDE: Ruth, everybody, get down. It's going to go up!
JO: You'll just have to start right at the beginning again.
RUTH: No, I couldn't. Not without the Professor. Just as well, I guess.
DOCTOR: It's done its job. Everything's now back to normal.
BRIGADIER: Right, stand quite still, everyone. Er, where's the Master?
DOCTOR: A very good question, Brigadier.
BRIGADIER: Doctor, glad to see you're back. Miss Grant, what on Earth are you doing in that extraordinary get-up? And where, for heaven's sake, is Sergeant Benton!
HYDE: The baby! We forgot the baby!
BENTON: Would somebody please mind telling me exactly what's happening around here?
