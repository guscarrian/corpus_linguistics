The Seeds of Death
Episode One
COMPUTER: Bombay Tokyo shipment activated. Bombay sending now. Tokyo receiving now. Dispatch completed. New York to Moscow delayed. Moonbase clearance awaited. Stockholm Washington personnel transportation. Stockholm sending now. Washington receiving now. Dispatch completed. Non-arrival shipment of synthetic protein New York to Moscow. Moonbase clearance awaited.
KELLY: Brent?
BRENT: Yes, Miss Kelly?
KELLY: Why is there a delay at Moon Control?
BRENT: There's some mix up with the Moscow shipment. It seems to have landed up in Canberra.
KELLY: Fewsham again, I suppose? Take Moscow out of phase while they sort it out.
BRENT: Moscow pending. Moonbase clear.
COMPUTER: Toronto Calcutta shipment activated. Toronto sending now. Calcutta receiving now. Dispatch completed.
BRENT: Moscow ready now, Miss Kelly.
KELLY: Report Canberra Moscow situation, please.
COMPUTER: Canberra Moscow clear.
KELLY: Brent, tell them to activate.
BRENT: Canberra Moscow, go ahead please.
COMPUTER: Canberra sending now. Moscow receiving now. Dispatch completed.
OSGOOD: Good morning, Gia.
KELLY: Morning. Just as well you've arrived.
OSGOOD: Why, what's up?
KELLY: The sooner you take over from Fewsham on Moon Control, the better.
OSGOOD: Oh, not again!
KELLY: All T-Mat consignments are five minutes behind schedule.
OSGOOD: What?
KELLY: Fewsham routed a large Moscow consignment through to Canberra.
OSGOOD: Oh, he's a lunatic.
KELLY: You should never have recommended him for an Assistant Controller's job in the first place.
OSGOOD: Yes, I know now, but I thought he deserved a break.
KELLY: Sentimental. He'll do something really disastrous one day and you'll have to answer for it.
OSGOOD: So, I'll go and work in a synthetics factory.
KELLY: It's your career.
OSGOOD: So it is. Hey, have you got a T-Mat cubicle ready for me?
KELLY: Yes. Number six.
OSGOOD: See you later.
KELLY: Prepare lunar cubicle number six for transport to Moon Control.
BRENT: Ready and waiting.
KELLY: Activate.
BRENT: It's lucky he got here before your man arrived.
KELLY: Yes, he's late. Keep a public T-Mat cubicle open for him.
BRENT: Right. Local cubicle two holding open.
KELLY: Report Moonbase situation please.
COMPUTER: Moonbase clear. Routine shipments transferring on automatic control. Local arrival cubicle two activating.
RADNOR: Morning, Brent.
BRENT: Morning, sir. 
RADNOR: Good morning, Gia. All functioning well?
KELLY: Of course, Commander Radnor.
RADNOR: In your case, Miss Kelly, efficiency and charm go hand in hand.
KELLY: I try to keep things running smoothly.
RADNOR: Nothing ever goes wrong while you're on duty.
KELLY: I don't allow it.
OSGOOD: You may have been on duty all night, Fewsham, but that's no excuse for this kind of slip-up!
FEWSHAM: They weren't a major hold ups, just a few minutes.
OSGOOD: Kelly was going mad back on Earth Control.
FEWSHAM: She would.
OSGOOD: Look, I'm sorry, Fewsham, but it's my head in the noose as well, you know.
FEWSHAM: I know, I'm sorry.
OSGOOD: Oh, all right. All right, go on. You'd better get back to Earth.
OSGOOD: Now what?
FEWSHAM: The outer door airlocks.
OSGOOD: Who's there?
FEWSHAM: No one.
OSGOOD: Then how come the airlocks are in use?
OSGOOD: Phipps! What is it, man? What's happened? Come on, man!
LOCKE: Close the doors, we've got to keep
OSGOOD: Don't move, anybody. Don't do anything. Harvey, don't!
BRENT: Not again.
KELLY: The second Moscow consignment?
BRENT: Yes. They'll think we're deliberately sabotaging their stuff if this goes on.
KELLY: T-Mat reception, Earth to Moon. Controller Kelly calling. Switch your communication links to video.
KELLY: Osgood's gone too far this time. There'll be trouble.
OSGOOD: No! I refuse!
SLAAR: You would be wise to co-operate at once, otherwise you will be destroyed.
OSGOOD: Well I, I suppose that leaves me no alternative.
PHIPPS: Don't do it, sir.
SLAAR: Silence.
OSGOOD: There's a certain element of risk.
SLAAR: You are wasting time.
SLAAR: What is happening?
OSGOOD: I'm afraid there has been a fault. The circuit's overloaded. Very unfortunate.
SLAAR: You have deliberately sabotaged this apparatus. Kill him.
RADNOR: I thought the system was infallible?
KELLY: It won't be anything serious.
RADNOR: I'm glad you think so.
KELLY: Brent, is there any obvious damage?
BRENT: No damage reported. All links stable.
RADNOR: That's only local, surely.
KELLY: It's only one stage of the checking process. Report on Intercity T-Mat breakdown.
COMPUTER: Complete power phase blank.
KELLY: State of materialisation pulse generator?
COMPUTER: Overloaded in power surge. No damage this end.
KELLY: Check with Moonbase.
COMPUTER: Primary video link dead.
KELLY: Cause?
COMPUTER: Being investigated.
RADNOR: Are you sure it isn't serious?
KELLY: My staff are running a thorough and immediate check. Until I have their report, I can't answer.
RADNOR: Then they'd better hurry. I want that report. Soon.
ZOE: Doctor, if we've landed, where are we?
DOCTOR: That is what I'm trying to find out, Zoe.
ZOE: A rocket?
JAMIE: Hey, we're just hanging in space.
DOCTOR: We can't be.
ZOE: Well, let's try and find a star we know.
DOCTOR: Ah there we are. What in heavens name?
JAMIE: Hey, what's he up to?
ZOE: He's trying to climb aboard.
DOCTOR: Just a minute, just a minute. Oh this control is. There we are. Now that, that's an ion-jet rocket of the twenty first century, but, this helmet, if I can. There we are. That's not nearly so sophisticated. It's certainly not later than 1960.
JAMIE: Well, those letters on his helmet?
ZOE: C C C P.
JAMIE: Aye.
DOCTOR: Of course!
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: Just a minute.
 
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that explains it.
ZOE: Oh Doctor, what is it?
DOCTOR: Hmm? Well it's a flying machine, designed by a gentleman by the name of Leonardo Da Vinci in about 1500.
JAMIE: Well, what's it doing up here?
ZOE: Doctor, where are we?
JAMIE: Aye.
DOCTOR: We're in a museum!
JAMIE: A what?
DOCTOR: A space museum! Look, there you are.
DOCTOR: A balloon.
DOCTOR: That's a transport plane. And, now those initials, they stand for Russia. That's Gagarin, the first Earthman in space. Look.
DOCTOR: Come on. Let's have a look round, shall we?
DOCTOR: Just a minute. Wait for me.
JAMIE: Hey, quite a place, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Oh, my word.
JAMIE: Hey, look at the size of this one, Doc.
DOCTOR: Yes. My word, Jamie, look at that.
ZOE: Oh Doctor, look!
DOCTOR: Very large.
ZOE: Doctor, look.
DOCTOR: Now, Zoe.
JAMIE: What's that?
MAN : Travel Mat is the ultimate form of travel. Control centre of the present system is the Moon, serving receptions at all major cities on the Earth. Travel Mat provides an instantaneous means of public travel, transports raw materials and vital food supplies to all parts of the world.
JAMIE: Travel Mat? It sounds like a flying carpet.
DOCTOR: Shush, Jamie, I'm trying to listen. 
MAN : Travel Mat supersedes all conventional forms of transport. Using the principle of dematerialisation at the point of departure, and rematerialisation at the point of arrival in special cubicles, departure and arrival are almost instantaneous.
ZOE: Faster than light.
MAN : Although the system is still in its early stages, it completely automated and foolproof against power failure.
JAMIE: Aye, well, we have our own system, thank you, only it isn't foolproof.
DOCTOR: Jamie, I think that's just a tiny bit
SLAAR: You saw what happened to your superior. You would do well to co-operate.
FEWSHAM: Killing him didn't do you any good.
SLAAR: But you will do as I ask.
FEWSHAM: There is nothing I can do!
SLAAR: You do not want to die?
FEWSHAM: Look, I'm not that good enough a technician. It needs an expert.
SLAAR: But you are second in command here.
FEWSHAM: Yes, but
SLAAR: Then you must have certain abilities. You must know what needs to be done.
FEWSHAM: In theory, yes.
SLAAR: Then you will do it.
PHIPPS: He'll only make it worse.
SLAAR: What is their status here?
FEWSHAM: Maintenance. Second class technicians.
LOCKE: There's only one person who can really put things to rights, and she's at Earth Control.
PHIPPS: Without her, it just can't be done.
SLAAR: Who is this specialist?
FEWSHAM: Miss Kelly, technical coordinator. But there's no way to reach her. T-Mat is not working.
SLAAR: But you have a video link.
FEWSHAM: Yes, but Osgood wrecked that too.
SLAAR: So, there is no means to communicate with Earth?
PHIPPS: No, you've cut us off completely.
SLAAR: In that case, you are useless. You will all be destroyed.
FEWSHAM: No, there's the emergency T-Mat link! It only operates from here to Earth.
SLAAR: Then you will activate the apparatus. At once.
FEWSHAM: It's damaged, too!
SLAAR: These technicians will help you repair it.
PHIPPS: We won't help you. Neither will he.
SLAAR: Then he will die. You will start work at once. There will be a guard at the door. When I return you will have the T-mat link ready for operation.
PHIPPS: Don't be such a fool, Fewsham. If we repair the emergency link these creatures can travel to Earth!
FEWSHAM: What about us?
PHIPPS: Do you think that will make any difference in the end? As soon as he gets what he wants out of us, we'll mean nothing to him.
FEWSHAM: If we co-operate there's still a chance.
PHIPPS: Osgood didn't take it.
FEWSHAM: You saw! Do you think I want to die like that? I want to live!
KELLY: Brent, is there anything at all, any trace of a reason?
BRENT: Every link has been double-checked. This end is functioning normally.
KELLY: Then it must be Moonbase.
BRENT: We've no way of checking their apparatus from this end, and they don't answer our call.
KELLY: Where's Commander Radnor?
BRENT: Not back from the Intercity Council meeting yet.
KELLY: He'll expect a full report.
BRENT: Well, there it is. We've even checked the computer.
RADNOR: Have you located the cause of the breakdown?
KELLY: This end is absolutely clear.
RADNOR: That isn't what I want to know.
KELLY: We cannot trace the fault.
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! I have senior government officials hounding me. They expect a more informative answer, and so do I.
KELLY: There isn't one. The trouble is at Moonbase.
RADNOR: Why can't you deal with it?
KELLY: We can't get there.
BRENT: We can't even talk to them.
RADNOR: Do you mean to tell me that there's no other way of contacting them?
BRENT: No.
KELLY: Only by rocket.
RADNOR: That could be our only answer.
BRENT: But the only place you'll find a rocket is in a museum.
RADNOR: Exactly.
KELLY: And even if there was one that could be made operational, there's no-one that could control such a project.
RADNOR: You're wrong. There is just one man, one man alone who can help us now.
ELDRED: For the last time, who are you and what are you doing in my private workshop?
DOCTOR: Now just listen, there really is no need for all these histrionics. We are perfectly harmless.
ELDRED: How did you even get in here?
DOCTOR: Oh well, the usual way. We just materialised.
ELDRED: The T-Mat cubicle always gives automatic warnings, but it didn't this time.
ZOE: Well that's not our fault, is it?
ELDRED: Why did you come?
DOCTOR: Well, this is a museum.
ELDRED: The museum is  What on Earth's that? It's a twentieth century Police Box, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Well, yes, in a way.
ELDRED: Well, how did a thing like that get in my museum?
ZOE: Oh, well you could say it was a form of space ship.
DOCTOR: Zoe, I think we do owe this gentleman an apology. We really are most interested in the museum, Mister? 
ELDRED: Eldred, Professor Eldred. Look, the museum is closed to the general public. You've obviously made a mistake. Perhaps you'd be good enough to leave.
JAMIE: Are you in charge of this place?
ELDRED: I own it. That is why I have the right to ask you to leave.
DOCTOR: Yes, but there's no need to threaten us, you know.
ELDRED: Trespassers are not welcome. Will you please go!
ZOE: We're not trespassers. We're very interested.
ELDRED: Interested? In Professor Eldred and his antiquated machines? Come for a good laugh, I suppose, like the rest of them.
DOCTOR: Laugh? You mean people laugh at all this? Why, it's a magnificent exhibition.
ELDRED: We've had enough souvenir hunters, too!
JAMIE: Now, we're not thieves, you know.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. We haven't come to take anything. We genuinely are interested in space travel. Why, especially a thing like this. This is superb.
ELDRED: Yes, magnificent. It was to have been the vehicle to take man beyond the moon. T-Mat put an end to all that.
DOCTOR: You mean this model's been abandoned? But it's speed and stability concept alone, it's a tremendous advance in rocket design.
ELDRED: Exactly! Exactly! Here, let me show it to you. Let me show it to you.
DOCTOR: I'll give you an hand, here we are. Oh yes, this is superb. My word.
ELDRED: And the secret, the real breakthrough, was a compact generator of enormous power.
DOCTOR: I see. And these must be the secondary electrode accelerators.
ELDRED: Yes. You see it beat the problem of the neutral caesium ions. And incidentally, it magnified the g-thrust to fantastic proportions! 
DOCTOR: That was awkward. What did you do about that? 
ELDRED: Well, I'll show you. Come with me, I'll show you. Look.
DOCTOR: What have we go here? Ah, blueprints!
JAMIE: Look at them, like a couple of kids.
ZOE: Yes. You can tell he's almost in love with that rocket.
JAMIE: Shush!
ELDRED: That's not surprising. I designed it. I've been in rocketry all my life. My father engineered the first lunar passenger module, and I travelled on the last trip back to Earth. Before it all finished.
ZOE: Before all what finished?
ELDRED: Space travel.
ZOE: But if the rocket was so good, why did you stop at the moon?
JAMIE: Aye, why end there?
ELDRED: Because of T-Mat. T-Mat, the ultimate in travel. With about as much sense of adventure as a synthetic carbohydrates factory.
DOCTOR: But surely rockets would still be useful as an auxiliary means of transport, wouldn't they? Besides, how would man get beyond the moon?
ELDRED: Nobody cares any more about exploring space. Life made. Well, it was made too easy by T-Mat.
DOCTOR: I see. So you lost government backing?
ELDRED: The project was abandoned, except by me.
FEWSHAM: You've got to help me. If we don't repair it, we'll all be killed.
LOCKE: Maybe we could repair it and T-Mat back to London.
FEWSHAM: With that thing guarding the door? I'm going to keep on trying.
LOCKE: Maybe there is something we can do.
PHIPPS: What?
FEWSHAM: I knew you'd see reason.
FEWSHAM: What are you doing?
LOCKE: The video link with Earth. Yes, it's not so badly damaged as the T-Mat.
FEWSHAM: We were told to repair the T-Mat link, not the video.
PHIPPS: Let's have a look. If we can't escape ourselves, maybe we can get a message through by video.
FEWSHAM: Look, the guard will see what we're doing. He'll kill us!
LOCKE: You play your game, we'll play ours.
ELDRED: No more money, no more facilities. A life's work abandoned just like that. All because of T-Mat.
DOCTOR: Well, I can understand your bitterness. Very short-sighted of the government to put all their eggs in one basket.
ELDRED: You still haven't told me who you are and what you're doing here.
DOCTOR: Well.
ELDRED: That's the main-door alarm! What's going on?
RADNOR: Professor Daniel Eldred. Well, well, well.
ELDRED: Radnor. Come to see how your spies are getting on?
RADNOR: I'm sorry? I don't think we've met. My name's Radnor. This is Miss Kelly.
DOCTOR: Oh, how do you do. This is Zoe, and Jamie, and I'm the Doctor.
ZOE: Hello.
JAMIE: Hello.
ELDRED: Oh, Radnor, don't pretend that you don't know them.
RADNOR: I can assure you I've never met them before in my life.
ELDRED: I see. I find three strangers prowling around my museum, and by the merest co-incidence you turn up on their very heels.
RADNOR: I can assure you I merely wanted a chat with a very old friend.
ELDRED: Why? You've done without a chat for a good many years.
RADNOR: Old times. Friendships don't die.
ELDRED: Our friendship ended the day that you walked out of my laboratory and joined the government administration on T-Mat!
RADNOR: Different men, different careers, Daniel.
ELDRED: Yes, but you happened to know which career was going to be financed by government funds.
RADNOR: But you could have come over with me. We asked you to join us.
ELDRED: Yes, and worked as Miss Kelly's assistant perhaps?
KELLY: You know I respect your work, Professor Eldred. We would have welcomed you on T-Mat.
ELDRED: I prefer rockets, obsolete as they are.
RADNOR: Not so obsolete as all that, Daniel, eh?
ELDRED: What?
RADNOR: We don't miss very much, you know.
ELDRED: So you've been spying on me.
RADNOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. We stopped that a long time ago.
ELDRED: I should think so. What's wrong with running a private museum?
RADNOR: Nothing, but you're doing rather more than that, aren't you, Daniel.
ELDRED: All right, what if I am? It's a free country, isn't it? What's wrong with having a hobby?
RADNOR: Rather more than a hobby, preparing an ion rocket for an unauthorised journey into space.
ELDRED: All right, so you know. What do you intend to do?
RADNOR: My dear fellow, help you, of course.
ELDRED: What?
RADNOR: You can make your trip with full government backing, as long as it's to the moon.
ELDRED: Why the moon?
KELLY: There's a minor fault developed at T-Mat control at Moonbase.
RADNOR: And we have to put it right, quickly.
ELDRED: I thought T-Mat was infallible.
KELLY: It will be, eventually, however we have no way of reaching the moon.
ELDRED: Except by out of date rocket. Oh, that's perfect! So you need me after all.
RADNOR: I thought you'd be taken with the idea, Daniel. And a large sum of government funds wouldn't come amiss, would they? Now, how soon can you be ready to  blast off. Well, come on, it's urgent! Can you give me an approximate ETD?
ELDRED: I could.
RADNOR: Good!
ELDRED: But I won't!
RADNOR: Why? There are no strings.
ELDRED: I don't have to give you reasons. I'm just telling you that I refuse.
PHIPPS: Right, that should do it.
LOCKE: I'll switch on the power.
FEWSHAM: You fools. When they find out, we'll all be killed.
LOCKE: Moonbase to T-Mat Reception Earth. Moonbase to Earth. Emergency. Emergency.
RADNOR: You can't refuse, man. There's more at stake here than an out of date rocket programme.
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor.
RADNOR: Excuse me. Radnor.
COMPUTER: Emergency message from Moonbase linking through now.
LOCKE : Commander Radnor, Miss Kelly. We are in desperate trouble. Osgood is dead and we're
RADNOR: Locke! Locke!
SLAAR: Guard!
SLAAR: Kill him!
Episode Two
SLAAR: Stop him.
SLAAR: Hunt that man. He must not escape.
SLAAR: You allowed them to send a message back to Earth.
FEWSHAM: They tricked me! I tried to stop them.
SLAAR: No matter. He will be found and killed.
FEWSHAM: What about me?
SLAAR: Have you repaired the emergency T-Mat link?
FEWSHAM: Not yet. It isn't easy.
SLAAR: But it is possible?
FEWSHAM: Yes, only give me time.
SLAAR: Very well, but now you know what will happen if you fail. You will die.
RADNOR: Daniel, don't you see this goes far beyond a petty quarrel over rockets and T-Mat! Those men at Moonbase are in serious trouble and we must help them.
ELDRED: You'll have to find some other way.
KELLY: With T-Mat dead there is no other way. Your rocket is our only hope of reaching the moon.
DOCTOR: Professor, listen to them.
ELDRED: I'm listening.
DOCTOR: In a way this is a triumph for your rocket.
ELDRED: Is it?
RADNOR: Of course it is. The government recognises the fact.
ELDRED: Then the government is going to be disappointed.
RADNOR: I don't understand you.
ELDRED: Oh, I'd better be frank with you.
RADNOR: Yes, I think you'd better.
ELDRED: I must admit I played with the idea of making a space flight. I even prepared a rocket.
KELLY: Well then?
ELDRED: It was just a dream, an illusion for a disappointed man.
KELLY: You mean there's nothing?
ELDRED: Oh, the rocket's there, partially prepared.
RADNOR: Good!
ELDRED: As for an actual lift off
RADNOR: We can do it, Daniel. I know we can.
ELDRED: It takes more than enthusiasm to get a rocket off the ground.
RADNOR: You've only to ask for what you want. Funds, men, equipment.
ELDRED: It needs the one thing that you have not got. Time.
KELLY: A crash programme with the best available technicians.
ELDRED: It's nowhere near ready, woman! Most of the equipment is still unchecked.
RADNOR: A computer can be programmed for that.
ELDRED: It would still be impossibly dangerous.
RADNOR: Daniel, it was you who created this rocket. It was your driving force and enthusiasm that got it off the drawing board. With you in control, we can't fail to succeed.
ELDRED: That was a long time past. Now my heart couldn't take the strain of the G-force.
KELLY: That doesn't mean your experience and knowledge are useless. We need your guidance.
ELDRED: No. I told you it's a dream. I can never go to the moon and neither can rocket ZA685.
JAMIE: Could we not help them? We could use the Tardis.
ZOE: What, for a trip to the moon?
JAMIE: Aye.
ZOE: We'd probably overshoot by a few million years.
DOCTOR: Yes, or by a few million miles. I'm afraid the Tardis is not suited to short-range travel.
ZOE: Still, I think we should help them if we can.
JAMIE: Aye.
DOCTOR: Yes. I think I could get your rocket to the moon.
ELDRED: You?
DOCTOR: Yes, I have considerable experience in space travel, and so have my two companions.
RADNOR: Doctor, that's splendid. Thank you.
ELDRED: But the rocket is not ready!
DOCTOR: Well, perhaps you're overestimating the difficulties. How much more work is required on your rocket?
ELDRED: It needs fuelling, and a complete computerised check-up.
RADNOR: Well, I can order that.
ELDRED: No! I will not allow it! The risk is too great. No!
RADNOR: If there was some other way, believe me I wouldn't even consider such a risk.
ELDRED: No!
KELLY: There's always the outside chance that the fault in T-Mat will clear itself.
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor. Urgent.
RADNOR: Excuse me.
RADNOR: Radnor. Go ahead.
COMPUTER: T-Mat receptions New York, Moscow, Tokyo express great concern over continued hold-up. Medical shipments and food supplies awaiting transit to Asiatic centres. Position desperate, Calcutta. Instructions awaited.
RADNOR: That's your answer.
DOCTOR: Well, we're willing to help, as I've said.
ELDRED: You don't know what you're doing. It's suicide.
RADNOR: Listen, if this fault lasts much longer, there's going to be worldwide chaos, and world population is at stake.
ELDRED: Infallible T-Mat putting the world in jeopardy?
RADNOR: All right, I admit it.
ELDRED: And now you want this man to risk his life to get you out of trouble.
RADNOR: No, not me, but thousands of people all over the world who will die if we don't take this risk. I'm sorry, but I've got no alternative. Miss Kelly?
KELLY: Sir?
RADNOR: I want all technical personnel working on this. I want that rocket prepared for launching.
KELLY: Yes, Commander.
RADNOR: We'd be grateful for your help.
ELDRED: If that rocket is going to reach the moon safely, you'll need more than help. You'll need a miracle.
WARRIOR: Continue the search. He must not escape.
KELLY: Commander?
RADNOR: Yes, Miss Kelly?
KELLY: Do you think it's wise letting these people crew the rocket?
RADNOR: Wise? No, of course it's not wise, but what's the alternative? We gave up training astronauts years ago.
KELLY: But who are they?
RADNOR: Some of Eldred's crazy friends, I imagine. But the man who calls himself the Doctor certainly knows his space travel.
KELLY: How can you be sure?
RADNOR: Well, you wanted the briefing, but he and the girl know more about space flight than Eldred.
KELLY: What about the boy?
RADNOR: Yes, I'm not sure about him. Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes?
RADNOR: Tell me, are all three of you planning to crew this rocket?
JAMIE: Oh aye. I can be useful too, you know.
DOCTOR: Jamie, I hadn't thought about you.
JAMIE: Hey, you're not leaving me behind and that's final.
ELDRED: There can be no excess weight on this trip.
JAMIE: Well, how much many this rocket thing hold?
ELDRED: Well it was designed for a three man crew.
JAMIE: Ah. Well then, I'm going.
KELLY: Commander?
RADNOR: Yes, Miss.
KELLY: The chemical fuel reserve stocks at launching site are barely adequate for a moon journey and return.
RADNOR: What about other sources of supply? 
KELLY: New York and Moscow. Transit impossible due to T-Mat malfunction.
DOCTOR: But surely it's only a question of getting to the moon. We shall come back by T-Mat, won't we?
RADNOR: Possibly. Depends what's wrong with it.
ELDRED: There is another source of supply.
RADNOR: Oh, what's that?
ELDRED: The fuel dump on the moon. There's a refuelling system connected to the landing bay.
RADNOR: But surely that equipment hasn't been used for years.
ELDRED: Neither has the radio homing beam, and if that doesn't work you'll never make a landing at all.
JAMIE: Oh, in that case we needn't worry about getting back.
ELDRED: Well, all the equipment has been completely automated and solar powered. Designed all myself. No reason why it shouldn't work.
DOCTOR: I'm sure it will.
ELDRED: Are you sure you remember all that I told you at the briefing?
DOCTOR: Oh yes, and even if I don't, Zoe has total recall.
ELDRED: Well, just in case, I've written it all down here.
DOCTOR: There's no need, we.
ELDRED: And there's a map of Moonbase, too. Now, you know how to operate the homing beam?
DOCTOR: Now don't worry about a thing. Your rocket is going to be in good hands.
JAMIE: Ahem.
DOCTOR: That's quite enough, Jamie.
ELDRED: And remember you've only got enough food and water for three days.
DOCTOR: Yes, well we've taken 
KELLY: Commander?
RADNOR: Yes, Miss Kelly?
KELLY: I think I should go as crew on the rocket.
RADNOR: Don't be ridiculous. You're too valuable here.
KELLY: But how can T-Mat be repaired if I'm not there?
RADNOR: Well, what about the other technicians already there?
KELLY: Osgood's dead.
RADNOR: Yes, well, what about Fewsham? Phipps?
KELLY: Oh, he's incapable of repairing it. I think I should go.
RADNOR: No! You're the only one who really understands T-Mat. I can't have you risking your life.
KELLY: And yet you're perfectly prepared to allow them to risk theirs.
DOCTOR: Now don't worry, Miss Kelly. We're going to be perfectly all right.
KELLY: But how can you be sure? You don't even know what the trouble is up there.
SLAAR: The emergency link with Earth, is it ready yet?
FEWSHAM: I've nearly finished.
SLAAR: Do not make any mistakes.
FEWSHAM: I am not an expert.
SLAAR: But you will do it.
FEWSHAM: Yes! But I don't see what good just this emergency link can be. Even if you had a gigantic army of warriors, you couldn't send them all to conquer Earth.
SLAAR: We do not need an army. Earth will be ours for the taking, very soon.
ELDRED : Ignition reserve power.
ZOE : Fully charged.
KELLY : Internal atmosphere settings?
DOCTOR : All normal.
ELDRED : Trajectory bearings, orbital lock.
ZOE : Pre-set registering normal functions.
KELLY: Lift off activation check complete. All readings alpha green.
RADNOR: Well done. In record time and not a thing wrong.
ELDRED: So far.
RADNOR: Doctor?
DOCTOR : Yes?
RADNOR: Final check on procedure after you land.
DOCTOR : Oh yes, I know. We're to re-establish video link with the Earth.
RADNOR: That's right. When we can see what's wrong, you can do the rest under Miss Kelly's supervision.
DOCTOR : Right. We're ready when you are.
KELLY: Link programme to telemeter guidance. KELLY: Three minutes. Countdown will begin at T minus sixty seconds.
RADNOR: This is it.
KELLY: All functions are on computer controlled pre-set. Clear launching site.
ZOE: Three minutes seems an awfully long time.
DOCTOR: Yes. You remember your take off briefing, Jamie?
JAMIE: Aye, he's told me all about this G-force stuff. Now I know.
ZOE: You don't know about it until you've experienced it.
JAMIE: Look Zoe, I'll have you know that the Doctor and I have
KELLY : T minus sixty seconds from now.
DOCTOR: There's one minute to go. Now hold tight, everyone.
ZOE: Well, I'm all right, Doctor. How about you, Jamie?
JAMIE:  Look, I keep telling you, I'm fine.
KELLY : T minus fifty.
ELDRED: Make sure telemeter guidance is operative!
RADNOR: Don't worry, everything's been checked and rechecked.
KELLY: T minus forty. Technicians report.
BRENT : All areas clear.
ELDRED: Check all systems.
KELLY: We have.
ELDRED: We must make sure.
KELLY: T minus thirty. Twenty six.
KELLY : Twenty two. Eighteen. Fourteen. Twelve. Ten.
KELLY: Ten, nine, eight, Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. We have lift off.
RADNOR: I never thought I'd see that again. A rocket rising in flight.
ELDRED: Beautiful! Let's see how they are. The link is dead!
KELLY: What? Something must have gone wrong on lift off.
RADNOR: Try the shadow channel.
KELLY: Nothing.
RADNOR: Do you mean to say we're out of touch completely?
ELDRED: What about radio link?
KELLY: Earth control to rocket. How do you read me? Over.
ELDRED: Nothing but static.
RADNOR: It's only a minor fault, surely.
KELLY : Earth control to rocket. How do you read me? Earth control to rocket.
ZOE: Don't release your safety straps until I switch over to automatic gravity control, otherwise you'll float away.
KELLY : Earth control to rocket, how do you read me?
ZOE: Oh, wait a minute! Switching to automatic gravity control now.
ELDRED: Try again.
KELLY: Earth control to rocket.
ZOE : Rocket to Earth Control. Wait a minute, can't you? We've only just recovered from take-off.
ELDRED: Is everything all right? We seem to have lost our video monitor link.
DOCTOR : Yes, I think there must be a fault in one of the circuits.
ELDRED: Doctor? Doctor?
ZOE: What is it?
DOCTOR: Well, one of the circuits has burnt out, Zoe. I'll switch to a secondary one.
JAMIE: Oh, no. This is worse than the Tardis.
ELDRED: Do you read me, Doctor?
KELLY: Sounds as though the entire communications circuitry has blown out.
ELDRED: Yes, let's hope that's all that's happened.
RADNOR: Keep trying, Miss Kelly.
FEWSHAM: It's done. The emergency link will work now.
SLAAR: Excellent!
FEWSHAM: What are you going to do?
SLAAR: Do not ask questions. Activate the link. On receive only.
FEWSHAM: Receive? But aren't you going to send anybody
SLAAR: Activate the link on receive at once!
KELLY: And you've double checked everything?
BRENT : Yes. The fault is definitely at Moonbase.
RADNOR: Is it possible for you to effect repairs over video?
KELLY: Provided the fault is not too major.
ELDRED: And provided they actually get there in the rocket.
RADNOR: They'll get there.
ELDRED: Why? How do you know? You can't even be sure the rocket's still in one piece.
BRENT : Miss Kelly!
KELLY: What is it, Brent?
BRENT : We've got through. The emergency T-Mat link to Moon Control is activating.
KELLY: Is someone coming through?
BRENT : No, it's on send.
KELLY: Moonbase must have managed to make a temporary repair.
RADNOR: It seems odd.
KELLY: That's all we need. Brent, have a full emergency kit waiting. I'll join you as soon as possible.
BRENT : Yes, Miss Kelly. Crew are standing by.
RADNOR: Where do you think you're going?
KELLY: Well, if we can send, it's the only thing I can do.
RADNOR: You've no idea what conditions are like up there.
KELLY: I know all too well what they're like down here. And it's my job to put things right.
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! You cannot assume that responsibility without authorisation.
KELLY: Commander, you've stopped me once. Please don't try it again, otherwise I shall have to go above your head.
ELDRED: She's after your job, Julian.
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! She's a fool. If we lose her, nothing can save us.
FEWSHAM: Thank heavens you've come.
KELLY: What happened?
FEWSHAM: Osgood. It must have been space madness. He just went berserk, raving mad. It was terrifying.
KELLY: Osgood? But he'd be the last man I'd have thought
FEWSHAM: So did we.
KELLY: Where are the others?
FEWSHAM: When Osgood fused the controls, Locke tried to stop him. Osgood killed him.
KELLY: This is fantastic! What about Phipps?
FEWSHAM: Well, he was injured too. I've put him under sedation.
KELLY: And you?
FEWSHAM: There's nothing wrong with me.
KELLY: You look frightened.
FEWSHAM: If you'd seen Osgood die, wouldn't you be?
KELLY: How did he die?
FEWSHAM: His body's outside. He just went out.
KELLY: Without a pressure suit? I see. Open all control sections and computer links. Fewsham, what are you doing?
FEWSHAM: I thought I'd best switch off the emergency link. With the trouble we've got it could easily burn itself out.
KELLY: Sensible. Anyway, it'll prevent Commander Radnor sending up a security guard to drag me back to Reception Earth.
SLAAR: The other human is still free. Find him. He must not interfere with our plans.
PHIPPS: Hello, Earth Control this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. How do you read me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Can you hear me?
ZOE: It's no use. No contact at all. Every circuit's dead.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, this is most unfortunate.
JAMIE: Aye, well don't try them again. You may blow the whole rocket up next time.
ZOE: Well, there's no use worrying about the radio now. We're nearly at the end of the journey.
DOCTOR: Well I had hoped we could stay in contact with Earth.
ZOE: We don't need them. All we have to do is activate the Moon homing beam.
JAMIE: Well, how do you do that? I thought we weren't in contact with anyone on the Moon?
ZOE: Well, it's quite simple, Jamie. It's an automatic device. We send out code radio signals which triggers the homing beacon into action. We automatically lock onto it until we reach the point in orbit where we fire retro-rockets to land.
JAMIE: Oh. Ah, but if they've all been cut off, how can they activate?
DOCTOR: It works off a different power source, Jamie. Solar power. It's independent of the T-Mat system.
JAMIE: Aye well, I just hope it works, that's all.
ZOE: Well, if it doesn't we're going to have trouble docking at Moon Control airlock. It could be quite a crash.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: Well, lets try, shall we? I think we're near enough. There, that's our activating signal.
ZOE: That's it. As long as that note is steady, we're home and dry, no trouble at all.
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me? Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me?
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency! Can you hear me? Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Can you hear me?
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control.
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me?
ZOE: The homing beam, it's cut out!
DOCTOR: I know, I know. I'm trying to re-activate it.
JAMIE: What's gone wrong? I thought you said it was infallible?
DOCTOR: Well, the solar power source must have been damaged, Jamie.
JAMIE: You said we'd have trouble if that didn't work!
DOCTOR: Yes. Without the beam it'll be impossible to land safely.
JAMIE: You mean we'll crash?
ZOE: Well, either that or drift on endlessly through space.
Episode Three
PHIPPS: Hello Earth Control. This is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me?
ZOE: At our present rate of drift and allowing for the usual gravitational influences, we'll be drawn into the heart of the sun in approximately five months and ten days.
JAMIE: No need to worry about that, then.
ZOE: What do you mean?
JAMIE: We've only got enough food and water for three days, remember? 
DOCTOR: Just a minute. I think I'm getting something.
PHIPPS : Hello Earth Control, this is Moonbase. Emergency. Emergency. Can you hear me?
DOCTOR: Hello, Moonbase. Can you hear me?
PHIPPS: Yes! Yes, I can hear you load and clear. What part of Earth are you speaking from?
DOCTOR : We're not on the Earth. We're in a rocket orbiting the moon.
PHIPPS: A rocket? But that's impossible!
DOCTOR: Well I can assure you it's not impossible. What is your emergency? What's happening on Moonbase?
PHIPPS : We've been invaded. Aliens have taken over.
KELLY: Put that cover back on. Right, let's test it now.
FEWSHAM: Do you really think it will work?
KELLY: No reason why not. We've replaced the overloaded circuits. It should be all right. Turn on the power. Hold it.
KELLY: Try again. We'll T-Mat back to Earth and report to Commander Radnor.
SLAAR: Stop! You will remain here.
FEWSHAM: Don't move! Do exactly as they say!
SLAAR: You will remain here.
RADNOR: Brent, has contact be re-established with Moonbase yet?
BRENT: No, sir. As soon as Miss Kelly was transmitted the emergency link switched off again.
ELDRED: And you've no idea what's happened?
BRENT: Oh, I'm sure Miss Kelly will sort things out all right.
RADNOR: I wish I had your optimism.
DOCTOR: How much longer, Zoe?
ZOE: Well, our orbit will bring us back into his range in approximately forty three seconds.
DOCTOR: Let's hope he can still transmit.
ZOE: Well, his signal was quite strong when we were orbiting his side of the moon. There's no reason for it to fade.
DOCTOR: It's not his equipment I'm worried about, it's his survival.
ZOE: Doctor, these aliens he described.
DOCTOR: How much did you hear?
ZOE: Bipeds, reptilian, armed with some kind of sonic device.
JAMIE: Yes, Ice Warriors.
ZOE: What?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Jamie and I have met them before. They come from the planet Mars.
ZOE: Well, what do they want?
DOCTOR: Mars is a dying planet. I imagine they're trying to find a new home.
ZOE: Why the Moon?
DOCTOR: Oh, I think that that's just a stepping stone.
ZOE: What did you they were? Ice Warriors?
JAMIE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yes. Well Mars, as you know, is a cold planet. They've adapted to that. It's heat they can't stand.
ZOE: We should just about be coming into range now.
DOCTOR: Hello Moonbase, hello Moonbase. Can you read me?
PHIPPS : Yes, I read you loud and clear.
DOCTOR: Oh thank heavens for that. Now listen. We need your help to make a landing.
PHIPPS : But you mustn't land. You must warn Earth about what's happened here.
DOCTOR: We can't do that. We've lost radio contact with the Earth.
PHIPPS : Well then, go back and warn them.
DOCTOR: We can't do that either. We haven't got enough fuel. We need to get to the fuel dump on the moon.
PHIPPS : But they'll kill you!
DOCTOR: Oh well, we'll just have to take that risk. Now, where are you Mister, er, what's?
PHIPPS : Phipps. I'm in the Solar Energy Store. Now, what do you want me to do?
ZOE: Doctor, if we could adapt our homing equipment to his radio signal, we could beam in on that.
DOCTOR: Did you hear that? We want you to keep your transmitter going.
PHIPPS : All right, I'll try, but I've no idea how long this transmitter can last.
DOCTOR: There, I think that's done it. Now then, let's see if we can pick up his signal.
DOCTOR: Yes. Yes, there we are. Now, Zoe, what about the approach trajectory?
ZOE: Yes, here.
DOCTOR: Ah good. Oh yes. Oh, I don't think I could have done better myself.
ZOE: We need to fire the retro-rockets in seventeen point five seconds.
DOCTOR: What? Well, landing positions, everyone.
ZOE: Two seconds, one, now.
ZOE: Let's hope there's enough fuel left to cushion down on.
JAMIE: Aye, and let's hope that radio beam thing doesn't conk out before we get there.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Jamie. I'm sure we're going to be all right.
PHIPPS: Hello Moon rocket. Can you hear me?
DOCTOR : Hello Moonbase. Yes, we can. We are coming in on your signal now. Whatever you do, keep transmitting.
DOCTOR: The signal! It's stopped!
ZOE: Can you get us back into orbit?
DOCTOR: No! No, I shall have to get us down as best I can.
ZOE: But if we crash into a mountain range, we'll be smashed to pieces!
ZOE: It's working again. Doctor, can you lock back onto it?
DOCTOR: Well, I'll try. Yes, yes, there it is. Oh, my word. I think we're going to be all right.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I'm sorry about the landing. Is everyone all right?
JAMIE: Aye, well, we're down, that's that main thing.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ZOE: Now what do we do?
DOCTOR: Well, the first we must do is to refuel. You can see to that, Zoe, can't you.
ZOE: Yes, but what are you going to do?
DOCTOR: Well I must go in search of Mister Phipps.
ZOE: But what about the Ice Warriors?
DOCTOR: Oh, I've met them before.
ZOE: But Doctor, you can't just go
DOCTOR: Well I've got to rescue Mister Phipps, now haven't I? Now where did I put that map of. Ah. Here we are. Now then, the Solar Power room is. Here we are. Oh yes. Oh yes, that seems to be quite a simple route.
JAMIE: Right, I'll come with you.
DOCTOR: No. You'll stay here and look after Zoe. Now don't worry, you're going to be quite all right.
JAMIE: Ah.
DOCTOR: Good luck.
ZOE: And to you.
JAMIE: And to you.
JAMIE: Well, how do we refuel?
ZOE: Oh, well, that's simple. It'll connect automatically from here. Now you watch this dial, and when it reads full, switch it off. Now do you think you can remember that?
JAMIE: Of course I can.
ZOE: Good. I want to have a look at the rocket motors.
JAMIE: Why, what's the matter?
ZOE: Well I didn't much like the way we landed. It could have caused some damage.
JAMIE: Well, I know it was a bit rough, but surely it wasn't as bad as all that?
ZOE: Well, it's not the landing that matters now, it's the take-off.
FEWSHAM: Tokyo. London. Canberra. That's the lot. The whole system's completely operational again.
SLAAR: We can now send to any city in the world?
FEWSHAM: Yes, anywhere there's a T-Mat centre.
KELLY: Fewsham, do you realise what you're doing?
FEWSHAM: I'm trying to save our lives.
KELLY: And what about the people on Earth?
FEWSHAM: We're in no position to argue.
KELLY: Why do you want control of T-Mat? If you're going to invade the Earth, you'll be fighting the armed forces of the entire world. You'll never succeed. There'll be too much resistance.
SLAAR: There will be no resistance.
FEWSHAM: What about us? What'll happen to us?
SLAAR: You will remain alive as long as you are useful.
KELLY: You'll never get any help from me.
SLAAR: When the time comes you will do exactly what you are told, or die.
DOCTOR: Hello?
PHIPPS: Who are you?
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh, Mister Phipps, I presume?
PHIPPS: Yes, but where'd you come from?
DOCTOR: From the rocket. We were talking on the radio.
PHIPPS: Thank heavens you made it. Are the others here too?
DOCTOR: No, they're still in the rocket. How many of the Ice Warriors are there?
PHIPPS: These creatures, you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PHIPPS: Well, there aren't many, but they're deadly.
DOCTOR: Oh, they have their weak points.
PHIPPS: Look, they've killed everybody here. All except Fewsham. He's helping them.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, there's only one thing for it. We shall have to destroy T-Mat.
PHIPPS: What!
JAMIE: Are you all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR : Yes. Have you refuelled the rocket, Jamie?
JAMIE: Yes, we've just finished and Zoe's checking the rocket motors.
DOCTOR : Oh good. I have found Mister Phipps.
JAMIE: How is he?
DOCTOR : Oh, he's quite all right but
JAMIE: Aye, and you're bringing him back now?
DOCTOR : Yes, eventually, Jamie, but I've got to put T-Mat out of action first.
JAMIE: But, but, but Doctor, what about the Ice Warriors?
DOCTOR : Now, don't worry. Jamie. You and Zoe prepare the rocket for take off and wait for us. Goodbye.
JAMIE: But Doctor. Doctor. Hey! Och.
JAMIE: That was the Doctor. He's found Phipps and he wants us to prepare the rocket for take off while they put T-Mat out of action.
ZOE: But he can't!
JAMIE: Why?
ZOE: I've just checked the main power drive and the rocket's motors are completely useless.
JAMIE: What?
ZOE: The only way back to Earth is by T-Mat.
JAMIE: Oh!
ZOE: Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me? This is Zoe. Doctor! Oh he must have switched off!
JAMIE: Oh, now what do we do?
ZOE: We'll go and find him. Come on.
DOCTOR: Where is this leading to?
PHIPPS: Control Headquarters. Through this way.
DOCTOR: It's an Ice Warrior. It's got Miss Kelly. But how?
DOCTOR: Run!
DOCTOR: Stop!
WARRIOR: You must be destroyed.
DOCTOR: You've got no orders to kill me. Your leader will want to speak to me!
WARRIOR: Humans are our enemies!
DOCTOR: But I can be useful to you, like Fewsham. Your leader will be angry if you kill me. I'm a genius.
WARRIOR: Genius? You will come with me.
JAMIE: Now which way?
ZOE: I don't know. I'm lost.
JAMIE: I thought you knew the way.
ZOE: So did I. Let's try this way.
JAMIE: Women!
JAMIE: Oh, no. We could wander around here all day.
ZOE: Listen! Quick, here!
ZOE: What was that thing?
JAMIE: An Ice Warrior. You see, we were right.
JAMIE: Quick, run.
ZOE: Get back. Don't move.
JAMIE: Now what do we do?
ZOE: Keep looking for the Doctor and keep your eyes open for the solar energy room. Come on.
JAMIE: Solar energy.
FEWSHAM: I wish you'd tell me what you want me to do.
SLAAR: You will shortly dispatch a cargo to certain cities on Earth. They will include Ottawa, Oslo, Stockholm, Hamburg.
FEWSHAM: Cargo? What sort of cargo?
WARRIOR: The prisoner Kelly has escaped. This human was in the corridors.
SLAAR: Who are you? Where are you from?
DOCTOR: I might ask you the same question.
SLAAR: You will find the human Kelly and bring her back here. Who is this man?
FEWSHAM: He's not one of the crew. I don't know him. He must have just arrived here. 
SLAAR: Impossible. We control T-Mat. How did you get here?
DOCTOR: Our resources are not limited to T-Mat, you know.
SLAAR: You arrived here by other means, by spacecraft?
FEWSHAM: Rockets haven't been used for years.
SLAAR: Then you are lying. You have been concealed here all the time.
DOCTOR: But you can't be sure of that, can you? The people of the Earth may be preparing a whole fleet of rockets to defend themselves with.
SLAAR: No. Earth relies entirely on T-Mat. There is no defence against our plans.
DOCTOR: And what are your plans? Invasion by T-Mat? There are too few of you to conquer all the peoples of the Earth.
WARRIOR: The Grand Marshall has ordered all the seeds to be prepared. You are to receive your instructions.
SLAAR: Then guard the humans. If they try to escape, kill them.
DOCTOR: Why are you helping them?
FEWSHAM: I've seen what they can do.
DOCTOR: Do you know what is in that container?
FEWSHAM: All I know is they want me to send something to Earth by T-Mat. I suppose that's what's in it.
DOCTOR: Then I shall have to have a look inside, and you are going to help me.
ZOE: The Doctor's been captured? But couldn't you help him?
PHIPPS: I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do.
KELLY: We had a job to reach here ourselves.
JAMIE: Aye, so did we.
ZOE: Are you sure the Ice Warriors don't know about this place?
PHIPPS: Well, one of them did find it, but I managed to deal with him.
ZOE: How?
PHIPPS: Well, I fixed up a kind of booby trap to the solar energy power line.
JAMIE: Ah.
KELLY: By the look of those things I'd have though they were invulnerable.
ZOE: No. The Doctor said they can't stand heat.
JAMIE: Aye, that's right.
PHIPPS: The heating system of the entire base is controlled from the Centre. Now if we could reach those controls and turn up the heating.
ZOE: But how can we get there? There are Ice Warriors patrolling those corridors.
JAMIE: Aye.
PHIPPS: Yes I know. The maintenance tunnels. Over here.
JAMIE: Hey, if we could get through here, then turn the heating up, knock the Warriors out, we could rescue the Doctor.
KELLY: And T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.
JAMIE: Aye.
ZOE: But I thought T-Mat had broken down?
KELLY: Not anymore. I repaired it. How can we get this cover off?
PHIPPS: This part of the base hasn't been used for ages. It's rusted solid. It'll take some time.
JAMIE: Aye, well, the Doctor may not have much time.
DOCTOR:  All right, Fewsham. Now.
FEWSHAM: I can't! They'll kill us both!
DOCTOR: You have got to help me.
FEWSHAM: I said I can't.
DOCTOR: Very well, I shall do it by myself. If I'm caught, which is most likely, we will both get killed.
FEWSHAM: All right.
WARRIOR: Do not move!
FEWSHAM: I was ordered to prepare the controls for transmission. I've have got to check that everything is in order.
WARRIOR: Return to where you were.
FEWSHAM: But this is most important!
WARRIOR: If you are trying to escape, I shall destroy you.
FEWSHAM: I'm not trying to escape.
WARRIOR: Go back to where you were.
FEWSHAM: All right, all right.
SLAAR: Wait! Open it. I said open it!
DOCTOR: What are these things?  They look like seed pods.
 
FEWSHAM: What is it? What's happened to him? Is he dead?
JAMIE: That's it!
ZOE: I think I heard something.
KELLY: Be careful!
ZOE: There's one coming. I don't think he saw me.
JAMIE: We won't take any chances.
JAMIE: That should hold it.
ZOE: Get back!
PHIPPS: Don't move.
JAMIE: The booby trap thing, does it still work?
PHIPPS: It'll have to be reconnected.
JAMIE: Well, come on.
PHIPPS: Miss Kelly.
PHIPPS: Zoe.
JAMIE:  Hurry up!
PHIPPS: Right!
KELLY: Now!
SLAAR: You will prepare to activate the cubicle and transmit to London. Obey!
COMPUTER: Emergency transport systems now in operation. However situation still extremely critical in most parts of the world. Primitive areas surviving best but all major cities now suffering severe food shortages.
RADNOR: Without T-Mat, millions are going to die, especially in the cities.
SLAAR: Activate!
BRENT: Commander Radnor, the T-Mat is working.
RADNOR: Working? Kelly must have got through!
ELDRED: Splendid! What is it?
BRENT: It's alive!
Episode Four
BRENT: The thing's alive!
ELDRED: Get away from here. Quick, quick!
RADNOR: He's dead. Keep back. It must be that smoke. Guards! Keep away from here! 
ELDRED: Use the air conditioning!
RADNOR: Switch the air conditioning to expel.
ELDRED: It seems to be clearing. What was that thing?
RADNOR: Careful, Daniel.
ELDRED: It's all right. It's harmless enough now. It's shrivelled up.
RADNOR: Get Brent's body over to the medical wing. Tell them that I want a full autopsy.
RADNOR: Now what do you make of that?
ELDRED: Ever seen anything like that thing before?
RADNOR: No. It looked like some sort of seed pod, but why do you think it exploded like that?
ELDRED: Some plants reproduce that way. Their pods explode and spread their seeds.
RADNOR: All this thing spread was some kind of smoke.
ELDRED: Which has now been dispelled into the air of London.
SLAAR: Prepare to dispatch. Dispatch.
SLAAR: Hamburg.
FEWSHAM: Why are we doing this? What are those things?
SLAAR: Dispatch!
KELLY: Zoe, would you hold this for a moment? 
ZOE: What is it?
KELLY: Well, this circuit was overloaded. It blew out when we destroyed that creature. I'm trying to repair it. Okay.
ZOE: Well, this one looks all right.
KELLY: Let's hope it works.
ZOE: Well, let's hope we don't need it.
ZOE: There's no sign of them. It isn't getting any warmer, is it.
KELLY: Well they can't have had time to reach the heating controls yet.
ZOE: And the heating controls are in the main control room, aren't they.
KELLY: Yes.
ZOE: And so are the Ice Warriors.
PHIPPS: Are you all right?
JAMIE: Fine.
SLAAR: Paris. Dispatch!
JAMIE: What are they up to?
PHIPPS: I don't know. It looks as though they're sending something by T-Mat.
JAMIE: Who's that helping them?
PHIPPS: Fewsham.
JAMIE: Hey, can you see the Doctor anywhere?
PHIPPS: No, there's no sign of him. I wonder what it is they're sending?
COMPUTER: The object appeared in reception cubicle T-Mat headquarters. Leading Technician Douglas D Grant in close proximity to the object collapsed and died instantly. Cause of death as yet unknown. Message from New York ends.
RADNOR: That's another one. How many does that make?
ELDRED: Sixteen T-Mat reception centres.
RADNOR: How many deaths?
ELDRED: Brent here, that man in Berlin, two in New York. But I doubt if those things were sent just to kill one or two people at random.
RADNOR: What else then?
ELDRED: Well, I don't know, but
RADNOR: What?
ELDRED: I'm wondering if there's any pattern with these cities. London, Ottawa, Oslo, Hamburg, Berlin.
RADNOR: Yes, they're all major population centres, certainly.
ELDRED: But is that all they have in common?
ELDRED: What is it?
RADNOR: The autopsy report on Brent.
ELDRED: Well?
RADNOR: He died of oxygen starvation.
ELDRED: Oxygen starvation takes at least three or four minutes. He died instantly.
RADNOR: Exactly. And according to this the medical unit can't believe it either.
ELDRED: Obviously what killed him was that smoke-like substance which was emitted when the pods exploded, which was expelled into the outside atmosphere. Let's hope that diluted with air it loses it's toxic quality, otherwise
SLAAR: Zurich. Dispatch!
FEWSHAM: Is that the last?
SLAAR: It may be necessary to send further seeds later.
FEWSHAM: What about him?
SLAAR: Is he still alive?
FEWSHAM: Yes, he's still breathing.
SLAAR: That is unusual. Most humans would be dead. Take him to the T-Mat cubicle.
FEWSHAM: What for?
SLAAR: Do as I say.
JAMIE: What are they going to do?
PHIPPS: Shush!
SLAAR: Dispose of him.
FEWSHAM: What do you mean?
SLAAR: You will adjust the T-Mat controls and suspend him in space between the moon and Earth.
JAMIE: We've got to try and save him.
PHIPPS: Back of the cubicle. Over here, quick.
FEWSHAM: But you can't just ask me to kill a man just like that.
SLAAR: You dispatched the seeds. In so doing you destroyed your entire species.
FEWSHAM: Oh, no!
SLAAR: What is the death of one man compared to that?
FEWSHAM: What was in those things?
SLAAR: No more questions. Operate the controls.
FEWSHAM: I can't. I can't!
SLAAR: Prefer to die.
FEWSHAM: T-Mat is only programmed to send to other centres. I shall have to reprogramme the circuit.
SLAAR: Then do so at once.
JAMIE: Are you sure this is the back of the right cubicle?
PHIPPS: It'd better be.
SLAAR: Well?
FEWSHAM: Please. Please don't make me.
SLAAR: Complete it!
PHIPPS: Right.
JAMIE: Oh no!
PHIPPS: Oh, it's only the interior casing. It comes away easily.
JAMIE: Oh.
SLAAR: Is the circuit prepared yet?
FEWSHAM: Yes, almost. Almost.
SLAAR: You are wasting time. Operate.
FEWSHAM: No!
SLAAR: At once!
FEWSHAM: You've killed him. You've killed him! You've killed him!
SLAAR: Prepare to dispatch to London. Do as I say!
SLAAR: The time has come for your mission. You understand what you must do?
WARRIOR: I understand.
SLAAR: You must succeed at all costs.
SLAAR: Transmit to London.
FEWSHAM: I need time. I must reprogramme.
PHIPPS: Can you manage the Doctor by yourself?
JAMIE: Yes.
PHIPPS: Can you remember the way back?
JAMIE: Oh, I think so.
PHIPPS: I'll try and get to the heating controls.
JAMIE: Good.
COMPUTER: Reports now received on cause of death of T-Mat reception technicians in New York and Berlin. In all cases victims died of oxygen starvation.
RADNOR: Discontinue report.
ELDRED: Wait a minute. There's something else.
RADNOR: All right. Continue report.
COMPUTER: Information coming in on appearance of vegetable blight now attacking parks and gardens in the metropolises. Many areas
COMPUTER: Unidentified menace. Foam appears to be byproduct of large fungi which grow and burst, spreading their spores over large areas. Rate of growth of fungi such that acres of ground are covered minutes. Estimated that strong south westerly winds could spread this disease over large areas of Europe and Asia.
RADNOR: Guards!
COMPUTER: Destroying second crop cereals.
RADNOR: The guards. It's killed them. It's killed them all!
SLAAR: I shall return shortly. You will remain here.  The humans that escaped, have they been found?
WARRIOR: We are searching for them.
SLAAR: Intensify the search. They must be found and destroyed. Guard him.
ZOE: How is he?
KELLY: I think the water helped him.
JAMIE: Aye, well, we'd better get back there. We've still got to get those heating control things.
PHIPPS: It's no good, Jamie, we'll never make it.
JAMIE: Why not?
PHIPPS: Because the ventilator's too small and there's no other way.
JAMIE: Well, maybe I could get through.
PHIPPS: Look, it's impossible.
ZOE: How big is this grill?
PHIPPS: About so big.
ZOE: Well I could get through.
JAMIE: No, Zoe. You're not going.
ZOE: Look, I'm smaller than you and I'll probably be a lot quieter too.
JAMIE: Look, it's too dangerous anyway.
ZOE: Well, what other alternative is there?
JAMIE: Well.
KELLY: She's right. It's the logical thing to do.
ZOE: Thank you. Well come on, show me the way.
ELDRED: He can't just have vanished.
RADNOR: I can assure you that the security guards have lost all trace of it.
ELDRED: I wonder what its purpose was?
RADNOR: Purpose? What are you talking about?
ELDRED: Well, can't you see it's all part of the same plan. First the seed pods and now this creature. I tell you it came here for some purpose, and heaven help anyone who gets in its way.
ELDRED: Any trace yet of the alien creature?
COMPUTER: Reports from security negative.
RADNOR: There you are, what did I tell you.
COMPUTER: Security reports cordon round T-Mat complex unbroken.
ELDRED: At least we know it's still in the area.
COMPUTER: Correction. Urgent message. Bodies of three technicians found in T-Mat grounds.
ZOE: Which way now?
PHIPPS: I'm not sure.
ZOE: But you must remember. You've already been this way once with Jamie.
PHIPPS: Yes, I know, but I can't remember this time.
ZOE: But surely
PHIPPS: Look, I can't remember! All the tunnels look the same.
ZOE: Are you all right?
PHIPPS: Oh yes, I'm fine. I've seen most of my friends killed. I'm being hunted by monsters.
ZOE: If you go on shouting like that, you'll be caught by them and so will I.
PHIPPS: I'm sorry. I don't know what's the matter with me.
ZOE: It's nervous exhaustion and a slight touch of claustrophobia. Just sit down and we'll have a rest.
ELDRED: I tell you that creature came here for some purpose. It must be making for somewhere. Somewhere in this area.
COMPUTER: Urgent message. Contact made with security guard observing the alien.
RADNOR: Relay report direct.
GUARD : Report to Central control.
GUARD: Report to Central control. The creature is entering the east compound area.
RADNOR : What's happened? Report.
RADNOR: What's happened? Report!
COMPUTER: Security guard's ceased transmission.
RADNOR: Tell Security I want a armed patrol sent to the east command area without fail. Immediately. And relay any findings to me here direct. Top priority.
ELDRED: You're only going to lose more security guards.
RADNOR: Well, I can't let that creature roam loose, can I?
ELDRED: Can we stop it? Do you know how we can stop it? You know that bullets will do no good. We've seen that for ourselves. In all these cities that. Wait a moment. Yes! Oslo, Ottawa, Berlin, Hamburg, London, Paris, New York! These are the places where the pods have arrived.
RADNOR: Well, so what?
ELDRED: Well, don't you see? They're all cold climates. All northern hemisphere. In all of those cities it's winter, as it is here.
RADNOR: So?
ELDRED: Why haven't the pods arrived in any warm areas?
COMPUTER: Urgent message. Subject, continued breakdown of T-Mat and cessation of all world transport and distribution. Total breakdown of social order predicted. Emergency measures proving inadequate.
RADNOR: Discontinue report.
COMPUTER: Incoming data will be recorded.
ELDRED: Well, the emergency measures may still save a few people.
RADNOR: Well, what's the good of that? With the dislocation of food supplies, we could lose millions.
ELDRED: We may lose most of the world's population before they've finished with us.
RADNOR: They?
ELDRED: This creature. It's only the first. We're going to be invaded!
KELLY: Any sign of them?
JAMIE: No.
KELLY: They've been gone ages. They can't have reached the heating controls yet. The temperature seems the same.
JAMIE: Look, I'm going down there.
KELLY: No, our job is to act as a rearguard in case something goes wrong.
JAMIE: Look, a lot of good we are.
KELLY: Well, we're not entirely helpless.
JAMIE: You've got that thing working again?
KELLY: I think so, but we can hardly test it.
JAMIE: Oh look, where are they? What's keeping them?
ZOE: I think we ought to go on.
PHIPPS: All right.
ZOE: Look, can you remember the way now?
PHIPPS: No, it's no good.
ZOE: We could work it out.
PHIPPS: How?
ZOE: Well, presumably these maintenance tunnels run parallel to the corridors.
PHIPPS: Well, yes they do, but.
ZOE: Well, I've seen a map of the corridors. The Doctor had one in the rocket.
PHIPPS: But you can't possibly remember
ZOE: Yes I can, I think. Now there's a main corridor here, the two junctions here. We went left, right, left. It must be that one.
PHIPPS: But you and Jamie got lost on the way to the solar energy storeroom.
ZOE: Well, only temporarily, I found the way eventually.
PHIPPS: Well, you'd better be right this time.
ZOE: Oh come on!
ZOE: Oh, how long is it going to stand there?
PHIPPS: I don't know. But I daren't move the grille until it goes.
JAMIE: Look, I'd better see what's happened to them.
KELLY: All right, but
JAMIE: What?
KELLY: Shush. Quick, the door!
JAMIE: Too late!
 
JAMIE:  Now!
JAMIE:  Come on.
JAMIE:  Keep back.
  
PHIPPS: He's moving.
ZOE: Quick, move the grille!
FEWSHAM: How much longer must I wait here?
WARRIOR: Do not ask questions!
FEWSHAM: I need food, rest. I haven't had any sleep for hours.
WARRIOR: What are you doing?
FEWSHAM: I must fix the cubicle.
WARRIOR: But you said T-Mat was functioning properly.
FEWSHAM: I know, but there's something I've forgotten.
PHIPPS: Quick! Now the heating controls are over there. Turn the main wheel to full.
PHIPPS: Look out, Zoe!
ZOE: Well, help me, can't you? Help me!
Episode Five
ZOE: Are you all right?
FEWSHAM: Yes, I am. Who are you? What are you doing here?
ZOE: Oh, never mind that. I thought you were on their side.
FEWSHAM: Is that what they all think?
ZOE: Well, you have been helping them, haven't you.
FEWSHAM: I had no alternative. They'd have killed me.
ZOE: Well look, where are the other Ice Warriors?
FEWSHAM: I think they've gone to their ship, but they'll be coming back. We must get out of here.
ZOE: Oh but how?
FEWSHAM: Look, I can get you back to Earth. T-Mat is working again.
ZOE: Oh! Well, I'll get back to the others and tell them the good news.
DOCTOR: Oh, Victoria, Jamie.
JAMIE: No!
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie.
KELLY: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. Oh, I'm a bit dizzy. It's so hot in here.
JAMIE: Aye, lucky for us. Zoe and Phipps turned the heating up just in time.
DOCTOR: What? Well, where are they now?
KELLY: They went though the maintenance tunnel to the main control room.
DOCTOR: Ah, Zoe!
ZOE: Oh Doctor!  Oh, are you all right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so.
ZOE: Good.
JAMIE: Where's Phipps?
ZOE: He's dead. An Ice Warrior killed him.
KELLY: How did you manage to escape?
ZOE: That other man helped me.
KELLY: Fewsham?
ZOE: Yes.
KELLY: Well I thought that he was working for them.
ZOE: He saved my life.
KELLY: Doesn't sound much like Fewsham.
ZOE: He attacked a Warrior. He's also got T-Mat working again.
DOCTOR: Well, do I gather we can get back to Earth then?
ZOE: Yes, I think so.
KELLY: Well, let's not waste any more time.
ZOE: No. Come on.
RADNOR: Well, that's all we need.
ELDRED: What is it?
RADNOR: Gregson's here.
ELDRED: Gregson, eh?
RADNOR: Sir James Gregson.
ELDRED: United Nations Plenipotentiary.
RADNOR: Minister with special responsibility for T-Mat.
ELDRED: And your boss, in other words!
RADNOR: Oh, don't.
GREGSON: Radnor, I've read your report. I can't make head nor tail of it. Who's this?
RADNOR: Professor Eldred, sir.
ELDRED: How do you do.
GREGSON: Oh well.
RADNOR: He's helping me, sir.
GREGSON: This breakdown of T-Mat. What is the position now?
RADNOR: Still no contact yet with Moonbase, sir.
GREGSON: And what are you doing about it?
RADNOR: We've got people up there.
GREGSON: How'd you get them there without T-Mat?
RADNOR: We sent a rocket, sir. Professor Eldred is an expert in rocketry.
GREGSON: Oh, I see. And what happened to the rocket?
RADNOR: It's rather difficult to say, sir. We lost radio contact with it soon after take-off.
GREGSON: Is that all you've done?
RADNOR: Oh no. No, my Chief Technician, Miss Kelly, has also gone to Moonbase.
GREGSON: Oh, more rockets.
RADNOR: No, sir, she went by T-Mat.
GREGSON: But T-Mat isn't working.
RADNOR: Well, T-Mat started to function again, sir, so Miss Kelly went to the Moonbase with a repair team.
GREGSON: So you've had a full report from her?
RADNOR: Well, no, sir. Soon after take off T-Mat ceased to function again.
GREGSON: But this is quite ridiculous. T-Mat out of action and then this sudden outbreak of some sort of crop blight.
RADNOR: Ah, now, you see, sir, we think that's connected
GREGSON: As for this incredible story about a monster from outer-space
RADNOR: Well you see, Sir James, I think I owe you an explanation.
GREGSON: What happened about this creature? Have you any more news?
ELDRED: No, it seems to have completely disappeared. It was reported here, then it was seen by some workmen in a building here, and the last sighting was by the Weather Control Bureau there.
FEWSHAM: But I had to help them or they would have killed me!
KELLY: All right, Fewsham. There'll be a full inquiry when we get back to Earth. Tell them. We've no more time to waste here. We must T-Mat back to Earth immediately.
DOCTOR: But if we're all going, who is going to dispatch us?
FEWSHAM: Look, there's a way of doing that. Here. This is a time switch. It delays transportation by ten seconds.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. How ingenious.
FEWSHAM: Now I'll dispatch you, and follow using the time switch.
DOCTOR: Righto. Jamie, Zoe, come along. I think this could be quite fun, you know.
JAMIE: Oh.
 
KELLY: Fewsham, that time switch was down on the maintenance report as being inoperable.
FEWSHAM: We repaired it.
FEWSHAM: In you get, Miss Kelly. Look, I'll use the time switch. You'd better hurry or those Ice Warriors could be back any minute.
DOCTOR: You know, I find T-Mat travel rather disappointing. There's no sensation at all.
RADNOR: Where have you been?
DOCTOR: Ah.
RADNOR: And what have you been up to all this time?
DOCTOR: Well
RADNOR: And where's Miss Kelly.
RADNOR: Miss Kelly! Miss Kelly, what's happening up there?
GREGSON: Will somebody kindly tell me what's happening down here? Who are these people? Is T-Mat working again?
DOCTOR: Please! Let us answer one question at a time.
ELDRED: Doctor, do you know there's been a alien here?
JAMIE: An Ice Warrior, here?
DOCTOR: Jamie, I am not surprised. They have taken over the whole of the Moonbase.
RADNOR: What about the crew?
KELLY: All dead except Fewsham.
RADNOR: You left him there?
KELLY: Well he said he'd follow using the time switch.
DOCTOR: He should be back.
RADNOR: What's happening?
KELLY: I thought so. The time switch is out of order.
DOCTOR: What? But he said he was going to repair it.
KELLY: He was lying.
RADNOR: But why?
KELLY: Well, he's obviously working for them.
DOCTOR: Then why did he let us escape?
SLAAR: What has happened here?
FEWSHAM: The others, they got in through the grille and turned up the heating.
SLAAR: Where are they now?
FEWSHAM: They went back to Earth by T-Mat.
SLAAR: Why did you not go with them?
FEWSHAM: I refused. That's why they attacked me.
SLAAR: Refused? Why?
FEWSHAM: What do you think would have happened to me back on Earth? I'd have been executed as a traitor.
SLAAR: So you hope to live longer by staying here. You value your life. That is good. You will live if you help us when the invasion fleet arrives.
FEWSHAM: You're going to land on Earth?
SLAAR: No, our warriors will land here, on the moon. When the seed pods have done their work on Earth it will be time to commence the second stage of our plan.
DOCTOR: But don't you see gentlemen? The invasion of Moonbase, the taking over of T-Mat, the seed pods, the arrival of the Ice Warrior. They're all part of the same plan.
RADNOR: Plan? What plan?
GREGSON: These incidents are so unrelated. This fungus everywhere, what's that got to do with it?
DOCTOR: Well, I'm not sure yet. Have your people been able to make anything of it?
RADNOR: Well it's indestructible. We've attacked it in every possible way, but without success.
DOCTOR: Yes, but have you tried to understand it?
GREGSON: Are you suggesting we should psychoanalyse it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm only suggesting that instead of trying to destroy it, you find out it's composition and purpose.
ELDRED: Well, there's laboratory equipment in my workshop. You could use that.
DOCTOR: Good. Then we must find a sample.
RADNOR: Well, no problem about that. The gardens are full of the stuff.
DOCTOR: Fine. Then there's no time to be lost.
ELDRED: I'll get some equipment for you.
RADNOR: Er, Doctor, do be careful. Those pod things are deadly.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. I've already had experience. I'll be careful.
ZOE: But why did Fewsham stay on the moon?
KELLY: Pretty obvious. He was too afraid to come back here and face an inquiry.
ZOE: But he wasn't afraid to stay up there with the Ice Warriors. Well, given the choice I know which I'd rather face.
JAMIE: Aye.
KELLY: There's no time to worry about Fewsham. We must find a way of getting T-Mat working.
ZOE: But I thought it was working again now.
KELLY: It is working. It's still controlled from the moon. We must find a way of controlling it from the Earth.
ZOE: But is that possible? Don't you need the moon as a relay?
KELLY: There might be a way. I must talk to Commander Radnor about it.
JAMIE: Zoe, look, do you think the Doctor knows what he's doing messing about with that foam stuff?
ZOE: Oh, don't worry, Jamie. He'll be all right.
JAMIE: Oh, yes.
RADNOR: You really think it would work?
KELLY: Well, it couldn't be as effective as the Moonbase, of course, which handles up to two million microwave channels simultaneously. The satellite would take just a few thousand.
GREGSON: But that'd be enough for vital food supplies.
RADNOR: But surely we can't use the normal communications satellites. They're not programmed for T-Mat.
KELLY: No, we'd have to send up a specially programmed one.
ZOE: But that would mean using a rocket, wouldn't it? I thought no one used them nowadays.
KELLY: Not manned rockets, but we do send up satellites for communications.
RADNOR: How soon can you get one up?
KELLY: Well I don't know. If it were given top priority.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's organic. It's alive. Definitely a fungus composition.
DOCTOR: You're sure that this is correct?
ELDRED: As far as I can make out, it is.
DOCTOR: A molecule of five atoms absorbs oxygen. You know, a complete blanket of this would reduce the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere quite drastically.
ELDRED: According to my calculations, to one twentieth of normal.
DOCTOR: It would make the atmosphere of the Earth uninhabitable to the human race, but exactly like the atmosphere of Mars.
DOCTOR: Look at that. Even without vegetation to feed on, it's still active.
DOCTOR: Oh!
ELDRED: Look out, Doctor. If that thing explodes in here, the fumes will kill us. Come on, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Just a minute, there must be some way of
ELDRED: Come on, before its too late!
DOCTOR: Sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric acid. Acetic acid.
ELDRED: Come on, Doctor!
ELDRED: You've done it! Well, what was it? What did you throw on it?
COMPUTER: Extensive search by security forces reveals no trace of alien creature. Message ends.
JAMIE: So that warrior's still roaming around loose somewhere.
ZOE: But why did they only send one of them?
ZOE: Well, perhaps he's got to report back somehow.
DOCTOR : Is Commander Radnor there, please? Ah, Zoe! Is Radnor there?
ZOE: No, he's in conference with Miss Kelly and Sir James Gregson.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Zoe, it's the most wonderful news. We've found a way of destroying the fungus.
ZOE: Well, what is it?
DOCTOR: Water. Ordinary water! 
JAMIE: Eh?
ZOE: Oh, but Doctor, surely ordinary
DOCTOR: There's no time to explain now. Apparently there is a Weather Control Bureau somewhere. I want you to get in touch with them.
ZOE: Well, can't you reach them on the video-phone?
DOCTOR: Well, no. No, I've tried, but they're not answering or it's broken down or something.
ZOE: What do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Well, get in touch with Commander Radnor and ask him to get hold of the Weather Control Bureau people and to make rain. As much rain as possible over the entire country.
ZOE: All right, Doctor. I'll tell him.
DOCTOR: Right. The Professor and I are coming back now.
ZOE: Yes.
DOCTOR: Bye.
ZOE: But Doctor, suppose that? Oh!
JAMIE: Hey, how do we get hold of Commander Radnor?
ZOE: We'll ask the computer.
JAMIE: Do you know how it works? 
ZOE: Yes, of course. Put me in touch with Commander Radnor at once.
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor engaged in top level T-Mat conference with Chief Technician Kelly and Sir James Gregson.
ZOE: But this is urgent. I must talk to him at once!
COMPUTER: Commander Radnor not available.
JAMIE: Oh, now what do we do?
ZOE: We just have to go to the Weather Bureau ourselves.
JAMIE: We don't know where it is.
ZOE: Well, we'll have to try and find it. Come on.
JAMIE: Oh, Zoe.
SLAAR: There.
FEWSHAM: What is it?
SLAAR: Communications unit from our ship. Connect it to the solar batteries.
FEWSHAM: What's this section for?
SLAAR: That does not concern you.
FEWSHAM: I can't connect equipment if I don't know its purpose.
SLAAR: It transmits a directional beam signal.
FEWSHAM: A homing device. You'll use it to guide your armada onto the moon?
SLAAR: You will not ask questions. You will do as you are told!
JAMIE: Hadn't we better close the door?
ZOE: Why?
JAMIE: In case that warrior's still prowling around out there.
JAMIE: That should keep him out. Come on.
JAMIE: Well, where is everybody?
ZOE: I don't know. Well, let's try and find the main control room. Come on.
ZOE: So that's why nobody answered the video-phone.
JAMIE: Hey, and look at that!
JAMIE: No, it's no good. They're locked in position.
ZOE: Well, don't you see? It's what the Doctor said. Water. Rain. Well, it all makes sense now. They don't want it to rain on the fungus.
JAMIE: Well, shush! It's a warrior. Hide!
MARSHALL : Are all the preparations complete?
SLAAR: Yes, Grand Marshall. The seed pods have been dispatched to the cities of the Earth, and the Moonbase is in our hands.
MARSHALL : Good. Our fleet is approaching the gravitational field of the moon. Is all prepared?
SLAAR: Everything is ready. I shall guide our ships in on the homing beam signal.
MARSHALL : Fuel supplies are at marginal level. There must be no misjudgments.
COMPUTER: Final checkout routines under way.
KELLY: I hope they know what they're doing. It's been years since we sent up a satellite.
RADNOR: Are you quite sure the communications aspects will function?
KELLY: Yes. Once that satellite's up, T-Mat will be able to handle two thousand microwave channels.
ELDRED: What's going on? Someone sending up a rocket?
RADNOR: Look, look! What the devil's happening?
KELLY: I don't know. It's, yes, Moon Control.
DOCTOR: The sound, can you turn it up?
FEWSHAM : Shouldn't we test the directional beam?
SLAAR: It is not necessary.
FEWSHAM: But it's operating on Moonbase power. I can't guarantee the pulsing rate will be the same.
SLAAR: Very well. Test it.
DOCTOR: Commander Radnor, can this be recorded?
RADNOR: Well, yes.
DOCTOR: Well quickly, man. It's vital!
RADNOR: The transmission coming in on the video machine is to be recorded.
COMPUTER: Instructions understood. Transmission will be recorded.
SLAAR : The device is operating.
FEWSHAM : Wait a moment.
FEWSHAM: I must check the connections.
SLAAR: Why?
FEWSHAM: If the power fails we won't be able to guide the fleet onto the moon.
SLAAR: There must be no failures.
FEWSHAM: I realise the importance of that. If we overshoot the moon, nothing will stop them from going straight into an orbit around the sun.
SLAAR: They will not overshoot!
FEWSHAM: Of course not. But since their fuel supplies are at a marginal level, if anything did go wrong, they'd never be able to regain moon orbit.
SLAAR: This video device is operating. You have betrayed us!
FEWSHAM: Every word has bee heard on Earth!
SLAAR: Kill him!
COMPUTER: Countdown about to commence. Minus three minutes.
DOCTOR: Cancel the launch!
KELLY: Why? What do you mean?
DOCTOR: We can use that satellite to mislead the Martian invasion fleet.
RADNOR: What?
DOCTOR: Well, don't you see? Poor Fewsham deliberately let us overhear their homing signal. We can imitate that signal with a homing device of our own in the satellite!
RADNOR: Commander Radnor. Top priority message to satellite launching site. Cancel launch. Repeat, cancel launch!
COMPUTER: Message understood.
DOCTOR: If we can deflect their armada, half our battle is won.
RADNOR: But there's still all that fungus stuff everywhere.
ELDRED: We've solved that one. Plain ordinary H20. Water!
RADNOR: Water?! Well, all we need to do then is to make it rain.
DOCTOR: Well, haven't you already done that? Haven't you been in touch with the Weather Control Bureau?
RADNOR: You've only just told me.
DOCTOR: But I sent you a message over an hour ago. Didn't Zoe reach you?
RADNOR: No.
KELLY: An hour ago we were in conference.
DOCTOR: Oh, I see. Well, perhaps Zoe went to the Weather Control people herself?
ELDRED: Doctor, the Weather Control Bureau was the last place the warrior was sighted!
DOCTOR: What?
RADNOR: I'll have a squad of security guards over there right away. Hadn't you better wait, Doctor?
RADNOR: Get me Security!
DOCTOR: Zoe! Are you in there? Zoe!
DOCTOR : Zoe! Jamie! Let me in!
DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! Zoe!
DOCTOR: Oh no!
DOCTOR: Zoe!
DOCTOR : Let me in! Zoe! Jamie!
DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in! Oh, no!
Episode Six
DOCTOR: Are you in there, Jamie!
DOCTOR: Jamie, open the door!
JAMIE: Hey!
DOCTOR: Zoe! Jamie! If you're there, let me in!
DOCTOR: Oh no!
DOCTOR : Jamie, Zoe, open this door!
DOCTOR : Jamie? Zoe?
DOCTOR: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my word!
DOCTOR: What? Where are we going?
DOCTOR: Oh, my word. Oh, that was a dangerous situation!
ZOE: It still is, Doctor. There's an Ice Warrior in the building.
DOCTOR: What? What about Jamie?
ZOE: Well, he drew the warrior off so that I could let you in.
DOCTOR: Oh. no. We must help him.
ZOE: Oh no, Doctor, this way.
DOCTOR: What?
 
JAMIE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Jamie!
ZOE: Oh Jamie, where's the Ice Warrior?
JAMIE: Well, I locked him in the room that we were trapped in.
DOCTOR: I don't think he's stayed in there, Jamie. Come on!
ZOE: Oh look, we could hide in here.
JAMIE: We'd just be trapped again.
DOCTOR: No, Jamie, I think this is just the place.
JAMIE: Why?
DOCTOR: Solar energy room. That means that's a radiation door. Now, if I can find the control.
ZOE: Oh Doctor, hurry!
DOCTOR: It must be here somewhere.
JAMIE: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Ah, wait a minute.
JAMIE: Is that the one?
DOCTOR: No, Jamie!  It must be one of these.
ZOE: Oh hurry, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Ah! There we are. It's got 'shut' on it.
ZOE: Oh!
DOCTOR: Get back!
JAMIE: He's trying to blast his way in!
DOCTOR: Well, it should hold for a little while, Jamie.
ZOE: Well, what do we do now?
DOCTOR: Well, Commander Radnor's sending some security guards.
JAMIE: A lot of good they'll do against an Ice Warrior.
ZOE: Solar energy. When we were on the moon, Phipps made a trap.
DOCTOR: Solar energy. Reflectors, of course! Well, we ought to be able to rig something up here.
JAMIE: Aye, well, you'd better be quick about it. That shield thing won't hold much longer.
DOCTOR: Is this the sort of thing that Phipps rigged up, Zoe?
ZOE: Well, sort of. It's not quite the same. His was bigger.
DOCTOR: I think you'll find that this will be better for
JAMIE: They're still shooting out there. They don't stand a chance, though.
ZOE: Are you nearly ready, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Open the door.
JAMIE: Are you sure that thing works, now?
DOCTOR: The only way to find out is to try, Jamie. Now open the door.
DOCTOR: It's gone.
JAMIE: Must be chasing after those guards.
DOCTOR: Another moment and we could have destroyed him. There's some more HD cable there.
JAMIE: Eh?
DOCTOR: You reel it out and I'll make the connections.
JAMIE: What, this?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's it, Jamie. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Zoe, stand by to throw the switch. Jamie, play out the cable.
JAMIE: Right.
DOCTOR: Now, Zoe!
DOCTOR: All right, Zoe!
COMPUTER: No information yet available from Weather Control Bureau.
RADNOR: Oh, no. I'd better get over there.
DOCTOR : T-Mat control? Commander Radnor? Ah.
RADNOR: Doctor!
DOCTOR : This is the Doctor.
RADNOR: Doctor, are you all right? What's happening over there?
DOCTOR : Yes, well, we've had quite a battle here, but things are all right now. There was a warrior here, but we've dealt with him.
RADNOR: Excellent! Is there much damage?
DOCTOR : Well, yes, I'm afraid so. I'm going to see how much now. How are you getting along with the signal in the satellite?
RADNOR: Professor Eldred and Miss Kelly are coping with it now.
DOCTOR : Good. I'll be back as soon as I can.
RADNOR: How's it going?
KELLY: We're ready to test.
RADNOR: Play back recording of homing beam.
KELLY: Now, that's the Ice-Warriors' homing beam. Let's see if I can produce that exactly.
RADNOR: Oh, can't you get any closer than that?
KELLY: I shall, don't worry!
ELDRED: That's it.
KELLY: I'll lock it to that frequency.
ELDRED: Just one thing, Miss Kelly. Now that you've perfected this thing, how do you propose getting it to the launching pad without T-Mat?
KELLY: It just so happens I found a petrol car in a motor museum.
ELDRED: Really? What make?
KELLY: I've no idea, but it's got four wheels and it goes. Get this to the vehicle immediately.
ELDRED: Will a car be able to get through the foam?
RADNOR: Yes. I've arranged for a route to be cleared by hosing the foam.
ELDRED: Good, good.
RADNOR: But the only way we'll ever get rid of it permanently is by rain. Lots of rain!
JAMIE: It's hopeless, Doctor. You'll never get that thing going again.
DOCTOR: I'm not so sure, Jamie. After all, it's only the controls that are damaged. The workings are all right. If we can bypass the controls. Have you got your knife on you?
JAMIE: Eh? Aye.
DOCTOR: Lend it me, will you?
JAMIE: Be careful with this.
DOCTOR: That's it, thank you.
DOCTOR: There we are. Now, what have we got here? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, well, it's just a question of sorting this lot out, that's all.
MARSHALL : You should not have killed him. Who will operate T-Mat?
SLAAR: I have studied the controls.
MARSHALL : What if the apparatus breaks down?
SLAAR: I shall send warriors to Earth to bring back technicians.
MARSHALL : Soon all humans on Earth will be extinct.
SLAAR: It will take time for the fungus to remove the oxygen from their atmosphere.
MARSHALL : You must use that time to obtain another human, and do not kill him.
SLAAR: No, Grand Marshall.
MARSHALL : You will be prepared to activate the homing beam on our signal?
SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall.
SLAAR: I shall return to our ship to finalise invasion plans.
DOCTOR: Right, now then, Zoe, let's see what happens when we try to connect these two together.  No, I don't think so, somehow. What about these two?  Ah, that's better. I think I've succeeded in re-establishing one of these rain circuits, Jamie.
JAMIE: It's not raining yet.
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie. Weather control is a very difficult technology. You can't expect immediate results.
ZOE: Are you sure you're getting it right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, I hope so, Zoe. Just have to hope for the best, that's all. I must get on because there's another little job that I want to do.
JAMIE: Have you not got enough to do already?
ZOE: What else is there?
DOCTOR: Well, I want to make some alterations to my solar energy device.
MAN : Lift off in five seconds from now. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Zero.
DOCTOR: With any luck, we should have some nice heavy rain before long. Ah, there we are.
KELLY: Yes, the satellite.
ELDRED: Isn't that a beautiful sight?
KELLY: We finished and installed the homing device. It's working perfectly.
DOCTOR: Well done.
KELLY: Doctor? DOCTOR: Yes, Miss Kelly?
KELLY: I know we're sending up a false signal, but aren't some of the Martian ships bound to follow the right one?
DOCTOR: There isn't going to be a right one. There's only going to be ours, the wrong one, and that's going to lead the entire Martian fleet into an orbit around the sun.
ZOE: What about Slaar's signal?
DOCTOR: Oh, obviously that has to be stopped.
ELDRED: But how?
DOCTOR: Well, as soon as the satellite is up, I shall T-Mat myself to the moon and destroy their homing device.
KELLY: They'll kill you on sight.
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't think so. I've rigged up a rather interesting little device here.
KELLY: What's it for?
DOCTOR: Well, it's a development of the solar energy device that you so successfully used on the moon, only I've succeeded in rendering it portable. I've got a solar battery.
KELLY: Well, there it is. It's in orbit. We're now picking up the alien's homing signal from the moon. DOCTOR: Well, that means that their invasion fleet is getting closer. There's not time to be lost. Now, are you quite clear? As soon as I have succeeded in destroying their signal you must activate our signal in the satellite.
RADNOR: Oh, we'll be ready.
DOCTOR: Right, then I'll be off.
ZOE: Oh Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes? What is it, Zoe?
ZOE: You will be careful, won't you?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Zoe, I will. Are you ready, Miss Kelly?
KELLY: But Doctor, our control of T-Mat hasn't been tested.
DOCTOR: Then now's the time to test it.
SLAAR: No.
SLAAR: You, over there. I ordered you to be destroyed!
DOCTOR: Well, you weren't very successful, were you.
SLAAR: Destroy that weapon.
SLAAR: What is your purpose in coming here?
DOCTOR: Well, you don't expect me to tell you that, do you?
SLAAR: The directional beam is still operative.
DOCTOR: Yes. I'm afraid you were a little too quick for me.
SLAAR: Are you capable of operating the T-Mat mechanism?
DOCTOR: Oh no, I don't think I could
DOCTOR: Well, well yes, perhaps I could get the hang of it.
SLAAR: As long as you can be useful to us, you can live. But this time there will be no escape. You will familiarise yourself with the T-Mat controls.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you very much.
SLAAR: You will not touch the controls until I give the order.
KELLY: It's operating perfectly.
RADNOR: Good!
ELDRED: Shouldn't we have waited until the Doctor got back?
RADNOR: The moon signal has disappeared, hasn't it?
ELDRED: It may be purely atmospheric. For all we know they're still transmitting as strong as ever.
ZOE: The moon signal was strong enough before the Doctor left. He must have succeeded.
JAMIE: Then why hasn't he come back?
MARSHALL : We are receiving your homing signal clearly. Soon we shall enter the gravitational field of the moon.
SLAAR: All is prepared, Grand Marshall. I have obtained the services of another human. He will T-Mat our warriors to Earth.
MARSHALL : Good. I shall resume transmission when landing is imminent.
SLAAR: When our warriors arrive, you will transmit them to Earth under my direction.
DOCTOR: Yes, but they haven't arrived yet, have they. Something still might go wrong, you know.
SLAAR: Nothing can go wrong now.
DOCTOR: There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.
SLAAR: If anything does go wrong, you will be the first to die.
RADNOR: Scan closer!
KELLY: If they are going to divert, if should happen any moment now.
ZOE: Look, they're changing course.
RADNOR: I think you're right.
ELDRED: Yes, they're all following the satellite signal.
RADNOR: Then the Doctor must have succeeded. He must have turned off the Martian signal.
JAMIE: Well, what's happening up there, then? Why hasn't he come back?
RADNOR: Don't worry, Jamie. A squad of security guards armed with flamethrowers are on their way here now, and as soon as they get here we'll T-Mat them to the moon.
JAMIE: Oh, they'll be too late.
RADNOR: You'll just have to be patient!
JAMIE: Och, I'm sick of being patient!
JAMIE: Zoe. That T-Mat thing. Do you know how it works?
ZOE: I think so. Why?
JAMIE: Could you T-Mat me back to the moon?
ZOE: Oh, now Jamie, surely
JAMIE: Look, either the Doctor's all right, in which case we've no need to worry, or he's in danger and he needs my help.
  
MARSHALL : Slaar! We are passing between Earth and moon! The signal has not led us into the moon's gravitational field!
SLAAR: Have you lost my signal?
MARSHALL : Your signal is being received clearly, but we are off course.
SLAAR: Are you sure your calculations are correct?
MARSHALL : Our calculations have been checked. You have sent us into an orbit close to the sun!
SLAAR: Use your retro-active rockets to change course!
MARSHALL : It is too late. We have insufficient fuel for manoeuvre. You have failed us, Slaar! We shall all die! We are being drawn into the orbit of the sun!
SLAAR: This is impossible!
SLAAR: The signal. There is no power. You did this.
DOCTOR: Yes. That signal has been going no further than this control room.
SLAAR: But they were receiving my signal.
DOCTOR: Not your signal. Ours.
SLAAR: You sent a signal from Earth?
DOCTOR: We sent up a satellite. That signal has sent your fleet into a false orbit.
SLAAR: The heat of the sun will kill them! You have destroyed our entire fleet!
DOCTOR: You tried to destroy an entire world.
SLAAR: Earth will still die. The fungus will take the oxygen from your atmosphere.
DOCTOR: No, I'm afraid that you've failed there too. We can destroy the fungus.
SLAAR: Kill him!
JAMIE: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Jamie, look out!
JAMIE: Creag an tuire!
DOCTOR: Jamie, a live terminal!
DOCTOR: Oh, well done, Jamie! Oh, goodness me! Jamie, thank you very much. Now then, we must T-Mat ourselves back to Earth.
COMPUTER: Wide spread rainfall throughout the country. Some flooding but none serious. Fungus rapidly disappearing. Weather Control Bureau coming back into operation. World food shortages partially relieved now T-Mat becoming operational again. Message to Commander Radnor from the Security Council of the United Nations. Congratulations.
RADNOR: All right, discontinue report.
ZOE: So you really did know what you were doing at the Weather Control Bureau.
DOCTOR: But, Zoe, of course I did!
JAMIE: Aye, well, it took long enough to work, eh?
RADNOR: Well, the rain seems to have disposed of the fungus well enough. Now the next thing to do is to get T-Mat fully operational again.
KELLY: Yes, when moon relay's repaired we must check over the equipment and build in safeguards. From now on T-Mat must be entirely controlled from Earth.
ELDRED: Oh, surely you've learned not to put all of your eggs in one basket in future?
KELLY: T-Mat in itself is perfectly effective.
ELDRED: You need a secondary transportation system. A fleet of rockets on permanent standby.
RADNOR: Yes, but Professor Eldred, we
KELLY: There's no need to go to those lengths.
ELDRED: It's a question of common sense. I'm sure the Doctor will agree with me. Doctor.
JAMIE: Did you have to make it rain as hard as all that?
DOCTOR: Oh, Jamie, sometimes I think you're never satisfied.
ZOE: What did you rush us back here for?
DOCTOR: Well, you know, questions, explanations. It's very difficult. Come on.
ZOE: Oh, where are going now?
JAMIE: Oh, it's no good asking him. He's no more idea than the man in the moon.
DOCTOR: I heard that, Jamie. Come on.
