The Power of the Daleks
Episode One
POLLY: His face, his hair, look at it.
BEN: He's breathing, and the Tardis seems to be normal.
POLLY: Ben, what are we going to do? We can't just leave the Doctor there.
BEN: What, him? The Doctor?
POLLY: Well, that's who came through the doors. There was no one else outside. Ben, do you remember what he said in the tracking room? Something about 'This old body of mine is wearing a bit thin.'
BEN: So he gets himself a new one?
POLLY: Well, yes.
BEN: Oh, do me a favour.
POLLY: Then whatever happened, happened in here.
BEN: But it's impossible.
POLLY: Not so long ago we'd have been saying that about a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Stop. Stop. Concentrate on one thing. One thing.
DOCTOR: It's over.  It's over.
BEN: Doctor?
DOCTOR: The muscles are still a bit tight.
BEN: What are we going to do?
POLLY: It is the Doctor. I know it is. I think.
BEN: It's not only his face that's changed. He doesn't even act like him.
BEN: Come on, it's time we sorted this out. Now look here!
DOCTOR: Hold that.
DOCTOR: Tilt it.
BEN: Have you done with this?
DOCTOR: Put it down. Put it down.
BEN: Now what's the game?
DOCTOR: Ah! The Crusades, from Saladin. The Doctor was a great collector, wasn't he?
POLLY: But you're the Doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh, I don't look like him.
BEN: Who are we?
DOCTOR: Don't you know?
DOCTOR: Extermination.
DOCTOR: Ah. Very good. Nails need growing.
BEN: Now look, the Doctor always wore this. So if you're him, it should fit now, shouldn't it?
BEN: There. That settles it.
DOCTOR: I'd like to see a butterfly fit into a chrysalis case after it's spread its wings.
POLLY: Then you did change!
DOCTOR: Life depends on change and renewal.
BEN: Oh, so that's it. You've been renewed, have you?
DOCTOR: I've been renewed, have I? That's it. I've been renewed. It's part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn't survive. Come here.
DOCTOR: Come here.
DOCTOR: The Doctor kept a diary, didn't he?
POLLY: Yes.
DOCTOR: I thought so. I wonder where. I wonder where.
POLLY: He's a very different Doctor, Ben.
BEN: Yeah, maybe. Just where do we stand, though?
POLLY: Doctor?
POLLY: Doctor, what's going to happen to us?
DOCTOR: I think. I think we must have landed for sometime. I think it's time we went for a stroll.
POLLY: But you don't know where we've landed!
BEN: No, you haven't checked the oxygen or the temperature or anything!
DOCTOR:  Oxygen density 172, radiation nil, temperature 86. Strong suggestion of mercury deposits. Satisfied, Ben? Now, are you two coming or are you not?
POLLY: He does know us. He said Ben. Didn't you hear him?
BEN: Yeah, I heard. But he might just have been copying you though, mightn't he?
DOCTOR: Are you coming, you two?
DOCTOR: Time I put you through some tests, I think.
EXAMINER: Hello?
EXAMINER: Hello? Is there anyone there? Hello? Hello? Why don't they come?  Ah, so you've come at last. I'm from Earth. I'm the Examiner.
DOCTOR: Earth Examiner. Accord every access. Vulcan.
BEN: Doctor, where are you?
BEN: Phwoar, ain't it hot.
POLLY: Do you think the air's like this everywhere?
BEN: Nah, might be just around here. Don't want too many lungfuls of it, I know that. Here, when I was a kid, we used to live opposite a brewery. You could take a walk and get tipsy all in one go.
POLLY: It's beautiful.
BEN: No, don't touch it, Polly.
POLLY: I wasn't going to.
BEN: No, it's quicksilver. It gets through the pores. Where is the Doctor, or whatever he is, got to?
BEN: What's the matter? Hey, Polly! Hey, Doctor, wherever you are. Quick, there's something happening to Polly!
BEN: Quick! Over this way!
BEN: Doctor!
BRAGEN: Ah, Quinn, there you are. What have you got there? My people have found two more of them by one of the pools.
QUINN: This one's got a nasty bruise on the back of his head. Fallen over his feet and knocked himself out, I suppose.
BRAGEN: I suppose so.
QUINN: Why don't they use the kit we send them?
BRAGEN: Yes. The other two have had a rather bad dose of fumes. The girl has, anyway.
QUINN: Girl?
BRAGEN: Yes, but she'll recover.
QUINN: These comic opera guards of yours do have some uses after all.
BRAGEN: I pick them for their physical fitness.
QUINN: I thought it wasn't for their IQ. Give me a hand with the Examiner, will you.
BRAGEN: I wonder why Earth has chosen to send an Examiner to Vulcan? Just now, I mean.
QUINN: I don't know.
BRAGEN: It's a mystery, isn't it? He isn't due for another two years.
QUINN: How do you feel?
BEN:  Urgh.
QUINN: We saw your rocket overshoot the landing area.
BEN: Ay?
QUINN: Don't worry. Most of the ships from Earth do over-shoot. I'm Quinn, Deputy Governor.
BRAGEN: Bragen, Head of Security.
QUINN: Let's get them all back, shall we? I'll take the girl.
BRAGEN: Here, you two, help carry the Examiner.
BRAGEN: I suppose you Earth people can't wait to examine Lesterson's space capsule?
BEN: Ay?
JANLEY:  Lesterson.
LESTERSON: Look at this.
JANLEY: They've just brought in an Examiner from Earth, and a couple of assistants.
LESTERSON: An Examiner? What's he here for?
JANLEY: I thought you'd know.
LESTERSON: It's the capsule, it must be. Well, they can't stop me working on it, I'll tell you that.
JANLEY: Could anyone?
LESTERSON: The Governor's always been difficult about it. But surely they wouldn't send somebody all the way from Earth just
JANLEY: Look, what about the meeting?
LESTERSON: Meeting?
JANLEY: Yes. I've arranged everything. Can we still use the old rocket room?
LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so. But I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up with these pressure groups, Janley.
JANLEY: Well, somebody has to do something. The colony's running down and you know it.
LESTERSON: I'm too busy.
JANLEY: But if we ran things, you'd have better facilities, more money. I wish you'd take an interest.
LESTERSON: Now look, I don't mind letting you have the use of one of my rooms now and again, Janley, but don't try to involve me. This is what I find important. Two hundred years in a mercury swamp and this piece of metal that dropped from it? Look, a couple of minutes polishing and it's as good as new.
JANLEY: Wonderful.
LESTERSON: Rain, damp, heat, mercury. Nothing touches this metal. No corrosion, Janley. Think of that.
JANLEY: Well, I hope the Examiner lets you go on with your experiment. Frankly, I doubt it. I think the Governor's brought the Examiner here to stop you opening the capsule. You should join our group, Lesterson. You might need us one day.
BEN: So the murdered man was the real Examiner?
BEN: Well, did you see who did it?
POLLY: The Doctor got this button though.
BEN: I think it's pretty dull around here. I don't know why we don't just go back to the Tardis.
POLLY: Doctor, are you going to let them think you're the real Examiner?
POLLY: Won't that be dangerous?
BEN: Look, why don't you stop blowing that thing and talk to us properly?
POLLY: Ben!
BEN: Now don't you start. It's bad enough with him.
POLLY: Well, he hasn't done anything.
BEN: No, that's just the trouble.
BEN: He knows what happened back at the Tardis, yet will he tell us? Will he come out and say? Will he admit to being the Doctor?
BEN: Come in!
HENSELL: I am Hensell, the Governor. I trust you're all feeling much better?
BEN: I've felt worse, Governor. The Governor.
HENSELL: If Earth had seen fit to warn us you were coming, we might possibly have been able to guide you down to the landing area.
DOCTOR: If Earth didn't warn you we were coming, Governor, they must have had a very good reason. I wonder what it was?
HENSELL: Now look here, I run this Colony. I'm entitled to know why you have come to Vulcan. What is your brief?
DOCTOR: I am the Examiner.
HENSELL: Why are you here?
DOCTOR: To examine. And I intend to start my examination at once.
HENSELL: Someone's leaked reports about these Rebel groups. That's it, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Your turn now, Governor.
BRAGEN: There is Lesterson's capsule.
HENSELL: Internal affairs are my business, Bragen. Please don't interfere.
DOCTOR: Please go on.
HENSELL: The capsule. It was found in a mercury swamp. It must have been here for centuries.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Continue.
HENSELL: For centuries before the Earth colony arrived. I felt it might be dangerous. It might contain bacteria.
DOCTOR: I shall examine the capsule later. You may leave us.
HENSELL: I shall look forward to your report. Bragen, see that the Examiner and his party get some proper clothes, will you?
DOCTOR: We are wearing proper clothes.
BEN: Oh, how did he get that thing back again. That was a bit of a cheek, wasn't it, seeing if the Governor was the guy you got the button off?
POLLY: Doctor? When he was talking to you, you were staring at the other man.
DOCTOR: Yes, very rude of me, wasn't it. Terrible manners. To tell you the truth, I was studying his reaction, seeing if he agreed with the story.
BEN: Did he?
DOCTOR: Must have a look at that capsule.
BEN: Now, you want to watch you don't take this Examiner stuff a bit too far.
DOCTOR: Our answers must come from that mercury swamp.
BEN: 'Cause at least one bloke ain't going to be fooled.
DOCTOR: When Bragen found us, he definitely said space capsule.
BEN: Look, you're not going to fool the guy that did the real Examiner in!
QUINN: Bragen! What's all this nonsense about having to have a pass to see the Examiner?
BRAGEN: It's the Governor's idea.
QUINN: Surely it doesn't apply to me?
BRAGEN: It's not my order, Quinn. I expect the Governor wants to keep people away from him.
QUINN: It sounded like one of your red-tape ideas.
BRAGEN: It had nothing to do with me.
QUINN: Right!
JANLEY: Oh!
QUINN: Sorry, Janley.
JANLEY: My fault.
QUINN: Are you all right?
JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's just cleared me out of his lab. Is the Examiner going to let him open the capsule?
QUINN: I don't know. I'm on my way there now, if I can push past Bragen's army of lay-abouts.
DOCTOR: Where did you get this?
LESTERSON: It dropped from the capsule.
DOCTOR: Dropped?
LESTERSON: Yes, when it was being hauled into the laboratory. But, you can see, this metal could revolutionise space travel. That's why I'm insisting that we open it. Well, who knows what other marvels there may be inside?
HENSELL: But Lesterson, I didn't think you could open it.
LESTERSON: Well, I have a theory. I'm convinced that the opening mechanism on the other side is either here, or here.
DOCTOR: Extermination.
LESTERSON: Now, my theory is that I can insert a laser ray in this ridge here. The ray spreads, fuses the opening device and gets us in.
HENSELL: Examiner, I shall have to make it your responsibility.
DOCTOR: A laser. Why not? It shouldn't be too difficult.
LESTERSON: Well, we'll try the other side.
LESTERSON: Hmm. It's a bit disappointing.
DOCTOR: Not really. This is just an entry bay, isn't it.
LESTERSON: Yes, I suppose so.
HENSELL: Well, this doesn't get us very far, does it?
LESTERSON: Getting into the rest of the capsule will take time, Governor.
BEN: Well, can't you use that torch thing again? That must be an opening door.
LESTERSON: I should have to measure it up and find out where the lock mechanism is.
DOCTOR: I think we'll leave if for tonight.
HENSELL: Leave it for tonight? But what did we come here for?
DOCTOR: That is my decision, Governor.
HENSELL: But good heavens above, man.
DOCTOR: A hundred years you say this has been buried?
LESTERSON: Oh, at least. Now, there must be something in the inner compartment. We shall be able to find out where it came from originally.
DOCTOR: It didn't come from this planet Vulcan.
LESTERSON: Oh no, no, no. The metal is quite alien.
DOCTOR: Alien, yes. Very alien. Goodnight.
BEN: What's he up to now?
POLLY: Ben, we're not going to let him out of our sight.
HENSELL: Well, Lesterson, you got your way. Was it worth sending for this Examiner? This idiotic Examiner?
LESTERSON: I didn't send for him. I thought you did.
QUINN: Why don't you let me talk to the Examiner, Hensell. I can find out what's he's here for.
HENSELL: No, no, no, no. You keep away from him. We'll leave him to work with Lesterson here. We've all got enough to do without having to worry about some amateur critic from Earth interfering.
QUINN: But with five minutes
HENSELL: You heard what I said, Quinn. You won't mind keeping the Examiner busy, Lesterson? I don't mind what you do with him so long as you keep his nose out of our business.
LESTERSON: Yes. All right.
HENSELL: All right. Well, we shall talk about it tomorrow.
POLLY: Ben!
BEN:  What?
POLLY: Shh! He's in the corridor.
BEN: Who is?
POLLY: The Doctor, you clod. Come on, quick!
POLLY: He's going towards Lesterson's lab.
BEN: Of course. To the space capsule.
POLLY: Come on.
DOCTOR: Polly, Ben, come in and meet the Daleks.
BEN: What?
DOCTOR: The Daleks.
POLLY: You could have opened this before.
DOCTOR: These two pieces of metal are identical. The Doctor got one of them from the Daleks himself.
BEN: Why do you keep saying the Doctor if you mean you?
DOCTOR: I knew I should find them here. I knew it.
BEN: Ah, they look harmless. Not very lively.
POLLY: What do you think? Two hundred years in a swamp and you wouldn't look very lively either. Nothing could live through that, could it?
BEN: Live?
DOCTOR: Nothing human, no.
POLLY: Doctor, look.
BEN: What's the matter?
DOCTOR: There were three Daleks in here! What's happened to the other one?
BEN: Doctor!
Episode Two
DOCTOR: A light. A torch, outside.
BEN: Did you see it?
DOCTOR: Quickly, Ben, quickly!
POLLY: What was it?
POLLY: Can you answer me?
BEN: It was a sort of disembodied hand. A sort of claw. It was horrible.
DOCTOR: No. No, there's nothing.
BEN: You were right. There were three Daleks.
POLLY: Don't you know what it was? If there were three, who moved it?
BEN: Don't ask me. Lesterson?
POLLY: But he hadn't opened the capsule.
BEN: No, he said he hadn't opened it. Lets get our facts straight.
DOCTOR: Ah ha. Excellent! Good thinking, good thinking.
BEN: Well, does that mean you think he's been inside?
DOCTOR: Perhaps he's been experimenting on the Daleks? Ah.
POLLY: But, but they're things. I, I mean they're dead. They must be!
DOCTOR: This light is dead. Now the watch.
BEN: Do you mean these things just need power?
DOCTOR: Now, Lesterson's fanatic. The Governor's jealous of his own position. What does that suggest to you? Don't know. Haven't thought about it. But all is not well with this colony. Add to that one Dalek.
BEN: Oh, blimey, you don't half make mountains, don't you? One Dalek?
DOCTOR: Yes! All that is needed to wipe out this entire colony.
QUINN: Examiner? Examiner?
QUINN: Bragen, don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
BRAGEN: I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I was expecting to find the Examiner here, not you, Quinn.
QUINN: Well, he's not here. You'll probably want to start snooping under the bed, so I'll leave you to it.
BRAGEN: One moment.
QUINN: Don't try your luck with me, Bragen.
BRAGEN: On the contrary, I'm trying to avoid trouble. The Governor gave express instructions that you were not to contact the Examiner. I find you here. I'm sure you can offer some suitable explanation.
QUINN: I can. But not to you.
BRAGEN: Before you go. Oh!
QUINN: Don't ever try to block my way again.
BRAGEN: Guard!
BRAGEN: The Examiner is missing. He must be found immediately.
BEN: Of course, the real Doctor was always going on about the Daleks.
POLLY: Real Doctor?
DOCTOR: Real Doctor? Oh, you mean the real Doctor.
BEN: Yeah, now I've seen that claw thing, well, wouldn't want to shake hands with it, let's put it that way.
POLLY: Doctor, look, if they're that dangerous, what are you going to do about it?
DOCTOR: Save my breath. Would Lesterson listen? Lesterson listen. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen. Exercises the tongue. Try it. Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.
BEN: Look, they think you're the Examiner, order them to destroy the Daleks. Well, chuck your weight about.
POLLY:  Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen.
POLLY + DOCTOR: Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen, Lesterson listen...
LESTERSON: What do you think you're doing in here?
DOCTOR: Listen, listen.
LESTERSON: Who gave you permission?
DOCTOR: Read this. Aloud!
LESTERSON: Accord every access.
DOCTOR: Exactly! It doesn't say 'except your laboratory' anywhere does it? Unless it's in micro-print.
LESTERSON: I should have been asked first.
DOCTOR: What was the first thing you noticed when you looked inside that capsule?
BEN: Well, the Daleks.
DOCTOR: You were astounded?
POLLY: Yes.
DOCTOR: Amazed?
BEN: Yes.
DOCTOR: You didn't even give them a glance! Why? Because you'd been in there and seen them. Where is the third Dalek?
LESTERSON: I don't know what you're talking about.
DOCTOR: You opened up the capsule without permission. You found the inner compartment containing three Daleks. You took one of them away and you hid it!
LESTERSON: Hid it? What, what nonsense!
BRAGEN: May I ask what all this is about?
POLLY: We opened an inner compartment in the capsule, and Lesterson had already been in there.
LESTERSON: I don't deny that.
BEN: And he's nicked a Dalek!
BRAGEN: Dalek?
LESTERSON: It's the name the Examiner has given to two metal creations that I've discovered inside the capsule.
BEN: And they're dangerous. Evil.
LESTERSON: Lumps of metal. Quite inactive.
BEN: That's what you think, mate. If you'd seen
LESTERSON: I consider it my duty as a scientist to examine and investigate these objects. Now please, all of you, keep out of my laboratory. Keep your hands off my experiments!
DOCTOR: These lumps of metal, Daleks, I want them broken up, or melted down. Up or down, I don't care which, but destroyed!
LESTERSON: I refuse to allow it.
DOCTOR: I'm an Earth Examiner. I demand it.
LESTERSON: You're exceeding your authority.
DOCTOR: Perhaps we should ask the Governor about that? I wish to see him immediately.
BRAGEN: That might be difficult.
DOCTOR: But not impossible. Ben, Polly.
RESNO: Could he stop the experiments?
LESTERSON: I don't know. It's none of your business. You go and get Janley and then come back here. We haven't got any time to waste. Now go on, man. Quickly, quickly.
LESTERSON: They won't stop me experimenting. There must be some way to bring you back to life, and I'm going to find it.
BRAGEN: And of course you do have the right of any access.
DOCTOR: Which is why I have a badge which says so.
BRAGEN: Lesterson watches over his ideas like a mother hen.
DOCTOR: If there was a bomb under this floor timed to go off in five minutes, would you ask my permission before you ripped up the floorboards? Ah ha, fruit!
POLLY: Thank you.
BRAGEN: Examiner, it's up to you of course, but I'd advise a little discretion in your investigations. It's not a very good time, just now.
BRAGEN: Thank you. With all these disturbances
POLLY: Disturbances?
BRAGEN: Yes, minor acts of sabotage. Rebel cliques, secret newspapers, nothing important you understand, but it keeps the Governor busy. I've no doubt he'll tell you about it himself when I arrange your meeting with him.
BEN: When will that be?
BRAGEN: Oh, he's going on a tour of the perimeter of the colony. I'll find out if he can see you before he goes.
POLLY: Thank you.
BEN: You know, it's little things like this that make it difficult to believe that you're the Doctor. The other one, I mean. The proper one. Oh, nuts, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Nuts? Yes, certainly, here we are. Crackers?
BEN: You, my old china, are an out and out phony!
DOCTOR: China. Yes, I went there once I believe. Met Marco Polo.
BEN: No, not China. China! China and plate, mate, friend.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marco Polo, a friend. I believe he was.
POLLY: Don't listen to him, Doctor. I know who you are.
DOCTOR: Shh!
POLLY: It's a
BEN: Well, well, a touch of the bugs. Microphones.
POLLY: Someone's been listening to what we were saying!
BEN: Yes, so that's why you were messing about and talking nonsense.
DOCTOR: I never talk nonsense.
POLLY: Ahem.
DOCTOR: Well, hardly never.
BEN: Well, they certainly believe in making us at home, don't they?
DOCTOR: At first, I thought there might be more than one.
BEN: Here, I bet old Charlie Bragen did it.
POLLY: Charlie?
BEN: Well Fred wouldn't suit him, would it.
POLLY: If he did do it, do you think it was his own idea? I mean, he could have been under orders.
BEN: You mean from the Governor? Ah, I don't know. What do you think, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes. Yes of course. Let's consider this button for a moment. It's the only clue we've got to the murderer of the Examiner. The real Examiner.
POLLY: And who asked for him to come?
BEN: Well, Lesterson's crackers about that capsule. He wouldn't want anyone nosing about.
POLLY: Bragen said the Governor's been having trouble.
BEN: No, rule him out. Governors are all the same. He wouldn't ask for help. If he sent the word it would look as if he couldn't do the job properly.
POLLY: Yes.
BEN: Oh, well, I vote we go back to the Tardis. I've had enough of this dump.
DOCTOR: Have you? What about the Daleks?
BEN: Well, they're dead.
POLLY: Well, what about that thing we saw in the capsule? That was alive all right.
BEN: Yeah, I can't explain that.
DOCTOR: I can. And that's why we have to stay.
RESNO: Ugly-looking brutes, aren't they?
RESNO: What's he want to muck about with them for? Leave well alone, that's what I say.
JANLEY: You're a fine one to be a research assistant. Leave well alone. There'll be no progress on this planet with people like you around.
RESNO: We're doing all right as we are. Or we were until your lot came along stirring things up. You won't get away with it, you know. The Governor knows all about you rebels. He'll smash the lot of you when he's ready.
JANLEY: Governor?
RESNO: Yeah, the Governor!
JANLEY: He couldn't smash
LESTERSON: Will you be quiet! Where do you both think you are? This is a scientific laboratory. Kindly keep your politics out of it. Come on, Resno, man, get on with it. We haven't got all day. We've got to get this working before the Examiner stops us. He's got some phobia about these, these Daleks.
DOCTOR: I know the misery they cause, the destruction. But there's something else more terrible. Something I can only half remember.
POLLY: Doctor, what was it?
DOCTOR: Well? Where is the Governor? What did he say?
BRAGEN: He sends his apologies, Examiner. He can't see you tonight, but he hopes to see you first thing in the morning.
BEN: Well, it might not wait that long, Char, ah, Bragen.
BRAGEN: It will have to.
DOCTOR: Excuse me.
BEN: Where are you going?
DOCTOR: To see the Governor, of course.
BRAGEN: I'm afraid that's not possible. Once his door is closed, no one, not even you, Examiner, is allowed into his room.
DOCTOR: Very well.
BRAGEN: Thank you. Until the morning then.
BEN: What happens now?
DOCTOR: I shall radio Earth. Governor or not, Hensell will have to listen to them. I'll get Earth to back me.
DOCTOR: That's funny. I could have sworn. You stay here. I shan't be long.
LESTERSON: Connecting now.
RESNO: All connections responding.
LESTERSON: Nothing at all?
RESNO: No.
LESTERSON: Are you sure?
RESNO: There's nothing wrong here.
LESTERSON: Well, let's see.
RESNO: Really, if you can't trust me to read a dial.
LESTERSON: Be quiet. All right, we'll try again. This time we'll take it up to 3.24. Got that, Janley?
JANLEY: 3.24.
RESNO: It's moving.
LESTERSON: Now, note this, Janley. Number one attachment with sucker stick responding. Number two attachment not moving. Number three attachment with lens responding. Watch these meters, Resno.
RESNO: Still responding.
LESTERSON: Now, it's reasonable to assume that this the sucker stick acts like some kind of a hand.
LESTERSON: It's all right. Don't be alarmed. We've only introduced temporary power. We shall have to be able to open it up before we could find how it works permanently.
JANLEY: It's a bit frightening.
LESTERSON: Yes. Now, I cannot think what this short stubby arm is for.
JANLEY: Could the lens attachment be an eye?
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now it's quite possible that this, Dalek, now there must be some kind of directing influence. There may even be a simplified brain. Positronic, I shouldn't wonder. Oh, if only we could open it up.
LESTERSON: Now what?
RESNO: Everything functioning here.
LESTERSON: Yes. Well, perhaps the power is leaking away somewhere. We'll try again.
RESNO: Look at the eye-stick! It's watching us!
LESTERSON: Don't be absurd.
RESNO: It was, I tell you. I saw it.
LESTERSON: You can't use the phrase 'watching us'. You'll have us believing that the thing has intelligence next. Now, get on with your work, man.
DOCTOR: I know you're there.
QUINN: Examiner, thank goodness it's you. I've been trying to talk to you ever since you got here.
BRAGEN: What's happening here? You again.
QUINN: What do you want?
DOCTOR: I found the operator unconscious.
QUINN: Yes, so did I. I was just looking at him when I heard someone move. It must have been you.
BRAGEN: And those?
QUINN: I picked them up. What is all this?
DOCTOR: The cables have been cut.
QUINN: What? This is serious. It's not just our own communications. We're cut off from Earth as well.
BRAGEN: The only people that would want to do that are the rebels.
QUINN: If those muscle boys of yours had any brains, they'd stop things like this.
DOCTOR: Bragen, I was attacked just after I landed. This is a small souvenir I collected.
BRAGEN: This button belongs to you, doesn't it?
QUINN: Well, yes.
BRAGEN: And you say you picked these up? I suggest that you were sabotaging the communications.
QUINN: That's a lie.
BRAGEN: Having first attacked one of the engineers. I'd detain the Governor on evidence like that.
QUINN: I hope you're not thinking of detaining me, Bragen.
BRAGEN: I've no option. I could hardly let you run around loose after this, could I? All right, guards.
QUINN: I warn you, Bragen!
QUINN: All right, you win this round, Bragen. We'll see what it looks like in front of the Governor.
BRAGEN: The Governor will want an enquiry. May I ask what you were doing here?
LESTERSON: Right. I've redirected power. This time working up to 4.68. Now, Resno, you will have to dodge between the camera and your meters.
RESNO: Ready.
LESTERSON: Connecting now.
RESNO: All connections responding.
LESTERSON: Excellent.
JANLEY: It's working!
LESTERSON: Excellent. Film it, film it now, Resno. And note the readings, Janley.
LESTERSON: It seems to be interested in you, Resno. What's the matter with you, man?
RESNO: I tell you it's intelligent. It's watching me, Lesterson, weighing me up. I can sense it.
LESTERSON: Don't be a fool.
RESNO: I don't like it, I tell you. I don't know what these things can do.
LESTERSON: No, and we never shall know, shall we, unless we take film of every reaction. Now get on with your work, man.
LESTERSON: Resno!
JANLEY: It's all right, he isn't dead.
LESTERSON: What happened?
JANLEY: Knocked out by the shock wave.
LESTERSON: We must get him to the hospital. I'll go and get help.
POLLY: But we've got to defend Quinn.
BEN: Yeah, I know. He's innocent until he's proved guilty. But he is guilty.
POLLY: He's the Deputy Governor.
BEN: So what? I had a headmaster once who got nicked for not paying his bus fare. And then there's the motive. Don't forget the motive.
POLLY: Like what, for instance?
BEN: Well, he's the Deputy Governor, right? Maybe he wants to be Governor.
POLLY: Oh, that's ridiculous.
BEN: Well, the jacket button wasn't. And he was caught red-handed in the Communications room with a pair of pliers. And don't tell me he was plucking his eye-brows either.
POLLY: Look, there are some people you know are all right. You just know by looking at them.
BRAGEN: Good morning. The enquiry is about to begin. I've been sent to escort you.
LESTERSON: Hello, Janley.
JANLEY: Is it time?
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, I think so. I feel quite excited.
JANLEY: So you should. It's a wonderful achievement.
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, but the wonderful thing, Janley, is that we don't know the full scope of this experiment. Who knows where we may go from here. Who know what this Dalek may do?
JANLEY: It's harmless now?
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I've removed. Oh, Resno. Have you been to see him today?
JANLEY: Yes, yes.
LESTERSON: And?
JANLEY: He's had medical attention. He's going to be all right.
LESTERSON: Oh good.
JANLEY: No one must find out about this accident. It might give the Examiner just the excuse they want, and he could stop the whole project.
LESTERSON: Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes, you're right.
JANLEY: Well. Ready?
LESTERSON: Yes. Let's go and surprise them.
HENSELL: I am sorry I couldn't see you earlier, Examiner. Please sit down.
HENSELL: Well, Quinn, I don't like this any more than you do. What have you been up to?
QUINN: Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
HENSELL: Well, what about Bragen's report then? These are facts, Quinn. Now, what have you got to say about it?
QUINN: Does the engineer say I hit him?
BRAGEN: How could he if he was hit from behind?
QUINN: Then its only circumstantial evidence.
BRAGEN: The Examiner was also attacked in the mercury swamp. We have a button from your jacket found in the Examiner's hand.
QUINN: I can't explain that.
BRAGEN: I'm sure you can't.
HENSELL: Examiner. You seem to be in two minds.
BEN:  Yeah, and two bodies.
HENSELL: You mentioned to Bragen that these machines of Lesterson's. What do you call them?
DOCTOR: I call them what they are, Daleks.
HENSELL: Yes, yes, yes, Daleks. You say they could be a motive for destroying our communications.
DOCTOR: I do.
HENSELL: Lesterson, this is a special enquiry. Now please.
LESTERSON: This won't wait. You won't be disappointed.
HENSELL: You heard what I said, Lesterson.
LESTERSON: Governor, I've just completed an experiment which could revolutionise the whole colony. Bear with me.
DOCTOR: Lesterson, what have you done? What have you done?
LESTERSON: I'll show you. Janley, now!
BEN: It recognised the Doctor. It recognised him.
POLLY: What's the matter, Doctor? Are you all right?
DOCTOR: The fools. The stupid fools.
BEN: You're scared. What can it do?
DOCTOR: Nothing yet.
LESTERSON: This creation is called, I understand, a Dalek.
BEN: It knew who you were. It sounds ridiculous, but it did.
DOCTOR: It knew who I was.
BEN: The Dalek knows who you are.
LESTERSON: Now, look at it. I have merely given it electrical power, but it is capable of storing it. Moreover, it responds to orders. Turn around.
LESTERSON: Move that chair.
LESTERSON: Stop. You see? Well, just think what this could do for our mining program, our processing, packaging. Dozens of labour jobs, Governor. It may even supply the end to all this Colony's problems.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will end the colony's problems, because it will end the colony.
DALEK: I am your servant.
LESTERSON: It, it spoke! Janley, did you hear it? It can actually talk.
DOCTOR: It can do many things, Lesterson. But the thing it does most efficiently is exterminate human beings. It destroys them, without mercy, without conscience. It destroys them. Utterly. Completely. It destroys them.
DALEK:  I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant. I am your servant.
Episode Three
HENSELL: So, Lesterson, they're even capable of speech.
LESTERSON: Yes. But then, why not? After all, they have a certain intelligence.
HENSELL: Yes, I know, but
LESTERSON: But it is an intelligence that we can control.
HENSELL: So what you want is permission to continue your experiments?
LESTERSON: Governor, think what it would mean if we were to set it to work in the mines. It could double our production overnight.
BRAGEN: Consider the effects it could have on our whole economy.
HENSELL: Yes, and the effect of that on Earth. Yes, yes, they could be very grateful.
DOCTOR:  I shall stop you. I will.
HENSELL: All right, Lesterson, permission granted.
DOCTOR: Permission? Permission for what?
LESTERSON: To continue my work, Examiner.
DOCTOR: But, but didn't you all hear what I said? The Daleks must be destroyed!
LESTERSON: Never!
DOCTOR: Very well. If not by my order, then by Earth's! Come Ben, Polly.
HENSELL: Ah, Examiner, just a moment. Tell me, why are you so against this project?
DOCTOR: But I've told you! I realise I can't give you any proof, but you've no idea of the danger.
LESTERSON: No.
DOCTOR: Yes. Danger! I shall be contacting Earth just as soon as radio communications have been restored.
DOCTOR: You're my servant, are you?
DALEK: I am.
DOCTOR: Very well. Immobilise yourself. Go on. I order it! Immediately!
DOCTOR: Huh!
JANLEY: Lesterson.
LESTERSON: Why did you stop obeying? You were given an order.
DALEK: He has gone.
LESTERSON: Then you obey only
DALEK: His order was wrong. I cannot serve human beings if I am immobilised. You gave me power. Your orders are right. I serve you.
HENSELL: Lesterson. Lesterson, it reasons. Just how limited is its intelligence?
LESTERSON: Now, there is no cause for concern, Governor. Just you wait until you see the amount of work it can do. And now, I'm really going to put you through your paces. Follow me, Dalek.
DALEK: I obey.
DOCTOR: That's it!
POLLY: We should have stayed with Quinn.
BEN: Well, we couldn't have helped him, Polly, even if we'd wanted to. The Governor's already reached his verdict.
DOCTOR: Wire. Scissors. Tape.
POLLY: But he didn't murder the real Examiner. I'm sure he didn't.
BEN: Oh, well. The way I see it this lot's too busy arguing amongst themselves to do much about anything. Anyway, first things first. The Daleks are the important thing.
DOCTOR: Ah! Congratulations, Ben!
BEN: What did I do? What did I do?
DOCTOR: You just used your brains, that's what you did. The Daleks are the most important thing.
POLLY: I still think Quinn's innocent.
QUINN: How can I be in league with the rebels?
BRAGEN: The evidence confirms it.
QUINN: It was I that warned of their dangers.
BRAGEN: As part of your overall plan.
QUINN: You wouldn't even take the matter seriously.
BRAGEN: If I was wrong then, I have a chance to rectify it now.
QUINN: If that's going to be your attitude, I suggest that we
HENSELL: Quinn! Let us conduct this inquiry in an orderly manner. Now, the Examiner was attacked. There can be no question of that.
BRAGEN: And the button grabbed by the Examiner was missing from your suit.
HENSELL: Yes, if you've got anything to add to that, you'd better say it now.
QUINN: I didn't attack the man. I had no reason to. I was the one that sent for him.
HENSELL: You sent for him?
QUINN: It was necessary. Under the circumstances, I'd hardly be likely to sabotage the radio communications.
HENSELL: But, but why Quinn? Why?
QUINN: Because of the rebels!
BRAGEN: The rebels. They're nothing more than one or two fanatics.
QUINN: You know as well as I do that they
BRAGEN: Unless you're trying to create trouble here to undermine the Governor's position.
HENSELL: Bragen, you'd better explain that.
BRAGEN: If you're removed, who takes your place? The Deputy Governor, of course. And that's the real reason behind all this trouble, isn't it, Quinn?
HENSELL: Go on.
BRAGEN: You attack the Examiner in the mercury swamp and blame it on the rebels. Then you sabotage the radio and blame that on the rebels too.
HENSELL: Get him out of my sight!
QUINN: Hensell, before you listen to these preposterous allegations
HENSELL: I chose Quinn myself. I trained him for the job. Why, in a few years time, he'd have had this seat.
BRAGEN: Sometimes, Governor, a few years is a long time to wait.
HENSELL: Oh, Bragen?
BRAGEN: Governor?
HENSELL: You will assume Quinn's duties. As of now, you are Deputy Governor.
BEN: I hope you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: So do I. Excellent. excellent.
BEN: I thought we were after the Daleks, not this control unit you've nicked.
DOCTOR: If only we could find a. Ah, yes.
BEN: He's a right little delinquent, isn't he?
POLLY: Doctor, what on Earth are you up to?
DOCTOR: Now we're really getting somewhere!
BEN: Look Doctor, I don't want to appear dim, but how's this going to do the Daleks in?
DOCTOR: They think that Lesterson's the driving force, but I don't. The Daleks are using him.
POLLY: But how?
DOCTOR: Problem. Smash the Daleks, and the people here will lock us up or kill us. Let the Daleks go, and we'll all be exterminated.
BEN: We could just go back to the Tardis. At least we'd be safe to think there.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, it's coming on.
BEN: Oh, you talk to him, will you?
POLLY: Doctor, look, if you told us what you were up to, perhaps we could help you.
DOCTOR: Mustn't underestimate any of them. Lesterson's a first class scientist, first class. He opened the capsule. He realised that the Daleks could be reactivated.
BEN: Yeah, that could be the answer. Let's kidnap Lesterson, and hide him away for a bit. Well, it would stop him bringing the Daleks back to life, wouldn't it? I thought it was pretty bright.
DOCTOR: There we are.
BEN: What is it?
DOCTOR: What is it? It could be the answer to all our problems.
QUINN: Ah, Examiner, don't let them fool you about the rebels. They're strong. Try and find out where they hold their meetings.
POLLY: Leave him alone!
QUINN: It's all right, Polly.
DOCTOR: We'll help him Polly, but later.
POLLY: Yes, but
DOCTOR: Now, this is a case where a little injustice is better than wholesale slaughter. What we want is in Lesterson's laboratory. Come along.
LESTERSON: Incredible! Let's move on to test fourteen.
DALEK: I am ready.
LESTERSON: When sodium acts on ethyl alcohol, what is the resulting derivative?
DALEK: Sodium ethoxide. C2 H5 ONA.
LESTERSON: Just five seconds, Janley. Just the time it took to speak the answer.
JANLEY: It's right too.
LESTERSON: But of course it's right. Look, can you imagine what kind of positronic brain this robot has, Janley? Think of the store of knowledge that it must carry. Sulphuric acid.
DALEK: H2 SO4.
LESTERSON: Ah, you see?
DOCTOR: May I come in?
LESTERSON: What do you want?
DOCTOR: Oh, just to see how you're getting on.
LESTERSON: If you think
DOCTOR: No, please. I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm just interested, that's all.
LESTERSON: You've done nothing but meddle and interfere ever since you landed on Vulcan.
DOCTOR: Well, I did give you permission to open up the capsule, now didn't I? Oh please, carry on.
LESTERSON: And you won't try to stop me?
DOCTOR: Stop you? No, of course not. We got off on the wrong foot, Lesterson, but I'm a reasonable man, and I've been thinking perhaps I was hasty.
LESTERSON: Well, if you really want to call a truce.
DOCTOR: A truce? My dear fellow, I'd like to be friends.
LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, very well, you may stay.
DOCTOR: Oh, thank you. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Perhaps you'd like to amuse yourselves for a little while.
JANLEY: Laboratory. Yes. All right. I can come now. Right.
JANLEY: I just have to slip out for a few minutes, Lesterson, all right?
LESTERSON: Ah, yes, yes. Very well then, Examiner, shall we test its knowledge of physics?
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, splendid. Please, please, carry on.
LESTERSON: Thank you. What is the First Law of Thermodynamics?
DALEK: When heat is transformed into any other kind of energy or vice versa, the total quantity of energy remains invariable.
DALEK: That is to say, the quantity of heat which disappears is equivalent to the quantity of other kind of energy produced.
LESTERSON: You fool! What do you think you're doing?
DOCTOR: I'm saving your life!
LESTERSON: Get out! Get out!
DALEK: I have sustained no damage.
JANLEY: It's all right. It's been done.
BRAGEN: You were able to get away then?
JANLEY: Yes. Lesterson's with the Examiner. And Hensell?
BRAGEN: At a meeting of production managers. He left me in control.
JANLEY: We could take over the colony now.
BRAGEN: No. No, it has to be absolutely right. I don't want to take over a colony full of rebels do I, Janley?
JANLEY: I don't know. You're making me help them.
BRAGEN: Only to stir them up to create enough trouble to get rid of Hensell, and then, then we crush them. The whole colony will be grateful, and I'll be Governor.
BRAGEN: Is that the gun you told me of? Can you persuade the rebels this will help them?
JANLEY: Yes, Valmar thinks he can work in a switch to turn it on and off.
BRAGEN: How powerful is it?
JANLEY: It killed Resno, Lesterson's assistant. Lesterson believes that Resno's simply shaken up, taking a few days off.
BRAGEN: And the body?
JANLEY: In the mercury swamp. Lesterson was the indirect cause of Resno's death. It's a good hold over him if he makes trouble. I'll give this to Valmar then?
BRAGEN: Yes.
JANLEY: When do we move?
BRAGEN: I need another card in my hand. The Examiner bothers me.
JANLEY: I thought Quinn was the danger.
BRAGEN: Not any more. The Examiner's no fool. No, there has to be something else.
POLLY: Well?
BEN: Well, he's not in the laboratory. Lesterson's by himself.
POLLY: Hmm. He must have gone another way. Can I leave it you? I'm going to go back to the rest room.
BEN: But
POLLY: Somebody's got to clear it up.
BEN: Okay.
JANLEY: Hello there.
POLLY: Hello. You're Lesterson's assistant aren't you?
JANLEY: Yes. You're not looking for the Examiner, are you?
POLLY: Well, do you know where he is?
JANLEY: Yes, he's waiting to get a message through from Earth. He's in the Communications room.
POLLY: Erm.
JANLEY: Oh, you'll find it easy enough. Look. Around, then to your right, in the next block.
POLLY: Thanks very much.
POLLY: Doctor? Anyone here?
JANLEY: Well done, Valmar.
JANLEY: Hold her. Hold her.
JANLEY: There, that'll keep her quiet for a bit.
VALMAR: I've no idea who she is. She was just snooping around.
JANLEY: I sent her. We want her kept out of the way. Get a couple of your men to keep her in a safe place. Now, this is what I told you about.
VALMAR: Yes. The lethal power must come from here.
JANLEY: Uh huh.
VALMAR: It should have quite a good range.
JANLEY: Can you fix it?
VALMAR: It's easy. This could win us the revolution.
BEN: She said she was coming back here. She knew the way, and she wouldn't have wandered off. I know she wouldn't! Oh!
DOCTOR: Ben, if you were a Dalek, what would be your next move?
BEN: I'm talking about Polly.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no, no. She's a clever girl, but she couldn't answer this.
BEN: But she is missing!
DOCTOR: Oh, no, no, no.
BEN: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!
DOCTOR: No, no, no! She's looking around. There's a lot to see in the colony. She's interested. I like that.
BEN: Come on.
DOCTOR: Where are we going?
BEN: To report it. If we make a fool of ourselves, I don't care. We report it!
LESTERSON: Yes, yes, yes. I managed to stop that fool of an Examiner just in time. You know, there are some people here who believe that you're an enemy.
DALEK: I am your servant. What does this machine do?
LESTERSON: You know, it's amazing. You have an almost human interest and curiosity.
DALEK: A Dalek is bet, is not the same as a human. If I am to help, I must know everything.
LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, of course.
DALEK: What is this machine?
LESTERSON: It computes meteorite storms as they approach our weather satellites.
DALEK: How accurate is it?
LESTERSON: About seventy percent. It helps to cut down on our satellite losses.
DALEK: Daleks can build computers with one hundred percent accuracy.
LESTERSON: One hundred percent?
DALEK: If you provide materials and our own power unit, a computer will be built.
LESTERSON: A hundred percent? But that would be an enormous saving for the for the colony.
DALEK: Then you will get the materials?
LESTERSON: I'll go and speak to the Governor at once.
DALEK: I will be ready to dictate the blueprint when you return.
LESTERSON: Oh, that's marvellous.
BEN: You agreed we'd go and see Bragen.
DOCTOR: Hmm? Power.
BEN: Come on then!
DOCTOR: Now the energy intake for Daleks should be the cube
DOCTOR: Now then, twenty two over three. Nineteen times
BEN: Well, now what are you at? Talk to yourself.
DOCTOR: Oh, it's useless with incomplete data!
DOCTOR: Lesterson!
BEN: Eh?
DOCTOR: He just went past. That means we can get into his laboratory again.
BEN: But we're looking for
DOCTOR: Oh, come along, Ben. Come along.
BEN: There's somebody in there.
DALEK: What are you doing here?
DOCTOR: Stand aside. Servants shouldn't question.
DALEK: Entry is restricted.
DOCTOR: Not for me it isn't. Accord every access. I've got a badge.
DALEK: That is an order.
DOCTOR: A Dalek order. Short circuit the generator, Ben.
DALEK: Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stand back!
DOCTOR: Don't be frightened of it, Ben. It's not armed. I'm going to see what it was doing in there.
DOCTOR: Ben?
BEN: What?
DOCTOR: Let's get out of here.
BEN: The fool. Lesterson must have reactivated them.
DOCTOR: Yes. When I say run, run like a rabbit. Run!
DALEK: I have sent the human being for materials.
DALEK 2: And power?
DALEK: Yes. Power we can turn into static. Then we will conquer.
DALEKS: We will conquer. We will conquer. We will conquer.
DOCTOR: But if you didn't do it, Lesterson, then the Dalek must have used your power supply and reactivated the others itself.
LESTERSON: I was going to do that anyway.
BEN: Are you off your head, mate? Those two are armed!
LESTERSON: Then we turn off the electricity, disarm them, and then everything is safe again.
DOCTOR: But I've already explained to you.
HENSELL: Stop these arguments, both of you. I've had enough. I've every confidence in Lesterson. He has carte blanche for the Daleks from now on.
DOCTOR: But they must be destroyed!
HENSELL: Bragen, I'm making a tour of the perimeter. I put you in direct charge here. See that Lesterson gets everything he wants, will you?
LESTERSON: I shall need a permanent guard on my laboratory, Bragen.
DOCTOR: Huh.
BRAGEN: Don't worry about the Examiner. I think I can keep him quiet.
BEN: We've been forgetting about Polly.
DOCTOR: Greed and ambition, that's all it is. Wait till they find out what their precious production figures have cost them!
BEN: Oh, I want to see you.
BRAGEN: What about?
BEN: Well it's Polly, she's missing. We can't find her anywhere.
BRAGEN: I'll tell one of my men to make enquiries. It shouldn't take long to find her.
BEN: Ah, thanks.
BRAGEN: Examiner, some of my men have found a body in the mercury swamp. It was the body of a middle-aged man.
DOCTOR: What is that to do with me?
BRAGEN: You're the Examiner. Or maybe you're not.
DOCTOR: Just exactly what do you mean by that?
BRAGEN: Who are you? Quinn's friends come to stir up rebellion?
DOCTOR: There's only one possible way that you could know I'm not the Examiner.
BEN: Yeah, by knowing what the real Examiner looked like.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ben. Exactly! Only two people knew of his arrival on this planet. Myself and his murderer.
BRAGEN: That's enough!
BEN: Is it? Doctor, we've got to tell the Governor.
BRAGEN: Do you think he'll believe you? I'll soon convince him that you murdered the man yourself. You stole the Examiner's badge.
DOCTOR: Then why don't you arrest us? Because there's a doubt isn't there? Because it might, it just might, go against you.
BRAGEN: All right, all right, so neither of us wants to make a move. But you leave Lesterson alone. And the Daleks!
BEN: He'd make a right Father Christmas, wouldn't he?
DOCTOR: Oh, I'd rather fight a hundred of his sort than just one Dalek.
BEN: Listen to this. The girl is safe. She will remain so as long as you leave the Daleks alone.
LESTERSON: And did you disarm the other two?
DALEK: Yes. We are your servants. We do not need guns.
LESTERSON: I'm very glad. I knew the Examiner was wrong about you.
DALEK: Did you get our materials?
LESTERSON: Yes. Everything you need you can have.
DALEK: And a power plant?
LESTERSON: Everything.
DALEK: We will get our power.
DALEKS: We will get our power. We will get our power. We will get our power.
Episode Four
DALEK:  Turn back the power supply.
LESTERSON: I will, I will. But I want you to remember that I control you.
DALEK: We are your servants.
LESTERSON: I know. Remember it. I gave you each a special charge to bring you back to life. Any further power you need must come from this generator, and I control it. Is that clear?
DALEK: We obey.
LESTERSON: Where are they going?
DALEK: To await your orders, master.
LESTERSON: Good. Have you completed the blueprints for the meteor storm computer?
DALEK: It is ready.
LESTERSON: Oh, it's marvellous! I'm glad we understand each other.
DALEK: We understand the human mind.
BRAGEN: Isn't that finished yet?
VALMAR: Nearly. This is Valmar. Test call please.
VALMAR: Terrace. So I can hear you clearly all right, good. Now try and get in connection now with the interior, and then the perimeter stations. Well, no troubles now.
BRAGEN: About time. This work should have been completed long before this.
VALMAR: Well, I did the best I could.
BRAGEN: Well, it isn't good enough.
VALMAR: Then get someone else, Bragen.
BRAGEN: Be careful. I shall be watching you, Valmar, after this. Now get out.
BEN : See Bragen.
DOCTOR : Accord every access.
BRAGEN: What does this intrusion mean?
GUARD: I'm sorry, Bragen. I tried to stop them.
DOCTOR: Intrusion? It's no intrusion. We're just returning the various calls that you made. This guard tried to tell us you were busy. You're not a bit, are you?
BRAGEN: All right, I'll see them.
DOCTOR: Oh, what a nice new uniform. Very smart, very smart. I would like a hat like that.
BRAGEN: Well, what do you want?
BEN: Some joker has kidnapped Polly and sent us this note.
DOCTOR: Yes.
BEN: Well, we want to know what you're doing to find her.
BRAGEN: Now that the communications are restored we can start a search.
BEN: Yeah, I can just imagine what kind of job you'll make of that. Haven't you heard anything yet?
BRAGEN: The planet is a large one.
DOCTOR: So, they've given you the run of the colony, have they?
DALEK: We obey.
DALEK: Do I bring liquid for your visitors?
BRAGEN: No. They won't be staying much longer.
BEN: Look, Doctor, if he's not going to help us, we'll have to search for Polly ourselves.
BRAGEN: Sound advice. Why don't you, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Uh, uh. Examiner. I wonder how much longer they'll be able to move around on these floors?
BEN: Ay?
DOCTOR: The floors. They're not metal.
BEN: Doctor.
HENSELL : Ah, there you are Bragen. Thank heavens the communications are working again. It's bad enough being stuck out here on the perimeter. Well? Your report, man. Hurry up. I've got a very full schedule.
BRAGEN: There is nothing to report, Governor.
HENSELL : The Examiner?
BRAGEN: I'm taking good care of him.
HENSELL : Good, you know my orders.
BRAGEN: Yes, sir.
HENSELL : All right. Well, you can reach me here if you have to, that's all.
BRAGEN: One moment, Governor. When will you be coming back?
HENSELL : Oh, not for a day or two at least. You can manage, can't you?
BRAGEN: Yes. Yes, of course, Governor.
BRAGEN: What do you want?
DALEK: Have you finished your liquid?
BRAGEN: No. No, I haven't.
JANLEY: You'd better check the agenda.
KEBBLE: I'll do it now.
DOCTOR: Static, do you see. They need a constant supply of static from the floor. Some sort of electrical field.
BEN: Doctor. Why should he?
DOCTOR: It's madness!
BEN: What is?
DOCTOR: Letting them run around like this.
BEN: Hey, wait a minute. Bragen had one acting as a servant, and we've just left him.
DOCTOR: One Dalek in Bragen's office. Three Daleks just gone down the corridors. That makes four.
BEN: Where did the fourth one come from?
DOCTOR: Well, Lesterson can't have been making them. Perhaps there were more in the capsule than we thought.
BEN: We must go and see Lesterson. Yeah, and show him this note. Maybe he or Janley knows where Polly is.
BEN: We frightened him off. I wonder what the fascination of this notice board is?
DOCTOR: It looks like a perfectly ordinary notice board to me.
BEN: Yeah, well, come on, Doctor. We must find out who's got Polly. Doctor, come on!
LESTERSON: Janley?
JANLEY: What is it?
LESTERSON: The Daleks. They've given me another list of materials they need.
JANLEY: Let me see. We've got all those things?
LESTERSON: Yes, but why these quantities, Janley? Why? How can they have used up all the materials I gave them? What is it? Why, it's only a matter of a few hours ago.
JANLEY: They're building new things for us.
LESTERSON: Yes, well, I don't want them to do anything without consulting me. What is it they do inside there?
JANLEY: You're worrying too much.
LESTERSON: Look, Janley, say what you like, but I'm beginning to believe that the Examiner is right about the Daleks. Their original thinking terrifies me. If we can control them, fine. But if not
JANLEY: Yes?
LESTERSON: Then I shall have them destroyed. It's too dangerous. The Examiner knows something about them that we don't. I'm going to ask his advice.
JANLEY: I wouldn't bring the Examiner into it if I were you.
LESTERSON: And why not?
JANLEY: You want him to find out about Resno?
LESTERSON: Oh, a little accident. How is he? Is he better?
JANLEY: He's dead.
LESTERSON: What are you talking about? You told me he was
JANLEY: You were busy with the experiments on the Daleks.
LESTERSON: But you should have told me. But the body? It'll have to be reported.
JANLEY: Don't worry, no one will find the body.
LESTERSON: Oh, Janley, you've done a terrible thing.
JANLEY: The experiments on the Daleks were more important.
LESTERSON: More important than human life? No, no, I won't accept that.
JANLEY: You will. You must. Your carelessness was the cause of Resno's death. You murdered him. It's only your word against mine.
LESTERSON: I won't be blackmailed by you.
JANLEY: All I want is for you to go on as you are. Scientific discovery can't stop dead, Lesterson.
LESTERSON: I told the guard that no-one was to be allowed in.
DOCTOR: Accord every access, remember?
BEN: We're looking for Polly.
LESTERSON: Well, she isn't here, and I haven't seen her.
BEN: Well, she's been kidnapped.
LESTERSON: Oh, it sounds a little unlikely.
BEN: Oh, it does, does it? Well, we've got this note which tells us so.
LESTERSON: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about it.
DOCTOR: Lesterson?
LESTERSON: Yes?
DOCTOR: You haven't been building Daleks, have you?
LESTERSON: Building? No, I wouldn't know how to begin.
DOCTOR: And there were only three in the capsule?
LESTERSON: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well, we've just seen four. One in the Governor's office and three in the corridor.
LESTERSON: But that's not possible!
DOCTOR: There's only one explanation. The Daleks are reproducing themselves.
JANLEY: These things are machines. How could they reproduce?
DOCTOR: Machines? What makes you think they're just machines? The Daleks are brilliant engineers. Nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
LESTERSON: What?
DOCTOR: I said nothing is beyond them given the right materials.
LESTERSON: Oh.
DOCTOR: Lesterson, what's the matter?
LESTERSON: Oh.
JANLEY: Leave him alone. He's just been overworking, that's all.
BEN: Well, he looks bad.
JANLEY: Will you both go away. Guard! It's you, badgering him with questions. You've done nothing but hound him ever since you arrived on Vulcan. Bragen's orders were that no one was to be admitted.
GUARD: Yes, but I thought that the Examiner.
JANLEY: He attacked Lesterson. Get them out of here. Both of them.
BEN: He did not attack Lesterson!
JANLEY: Out, do you hear?
BEN: All right, all right.
JANLEY: Janley here. Tell Valmar to come over to the lab right away. Good. Now, it's all right. Come on. Rest here for a bit. There. You've been doing far too much.
JANLEY: Shh.
JANLEY: I've sedated him.
VALMAR: Well, what's the matter with him?
JANLEY: Overwork, I suppose. He just suddenly broke up. Anyway, it'll give you a chance to lay in the new power cable the Daleks have asked for.
VALMAR: You don't miss a trick, do you?
JANLEY: We're going to lay in the new cables you wanted.
DALEK: Good.
VALMAR: You're sure this is okay, Janley?
JANLEY: Of course. We help them, they help us.
DALEK: Yes. We are your servants.
JANLEY: Don't take too long about it, Valmar. Oh, you saw the notice, did you?
VALMAR: I saw it.
BEN: Well, we're still no nearer finding Polly. What are we hanging about here for?
DOCTOR: Ben, I've found a message in code. It's an anagram, you just take the capital letters, see? Work it out yourself.
BEN: Oh, I can't do crosswords.
DOCTOR: Meeting tonight, 2000 hours. R O C K E T -- Rocket. R O O M - Room. P. Rocket Room P.
DOCTOR: It's the rebel's way of calling a meeting. Only tonight we're going to be there, early.
BEN: Yeah, maybe we're nearer finding Polly than I thought.
BEN: Ow. I've got pins and needles now.
DOCTOR: What's the time?
BEN: Time we went home.
DOCTOR: Yes.
JANLEY: Now, we're going to demonstrate something. You section leaders can pass on what you've seen. So far, we've been concerned with testing the strength of the Governor with a few acts of sabotage. But now we're ready to take over.
KEBBLE: What is that thing? I've seen them moving about, but all we've been told is that it's a machine Lesterson discovered.
JANLEY: Valmar.
VALMAR: Lesterson removed the armaments of the Daleks he discovered. I've rearmed this one, but with a controlling device. We can regulate the fire power and turn it off and on whenever we choose.
JANLEY: Shall we have the demonstration now?
BEN: That's the one we want. He must be the boss of this outfit.
JANLEY: This screen is two inch thick tungsten steel. Right, Valmar.
VALMAR: Fire at the screen.
JANLEY: Quiet! You must keep quiet. We're too vulnerable here.
KEBBLE: But you can't control a thing like that. It'll turn on us.
JANLEY: No, it won't.
KEBBLE: I wouldn't let any of my group go anywhere near it.
VALMAR: I can control it.
KEBBLE: Prove it. Ah, you daren't! I'm not talking about that thing firing at the wall or bits of metal or anything. I mean people. Have you tested whether you can stop it from killing people? Our people?
VALMAR: Look, I can show you what I've done here.
KEBBLE: Forget it. How do you know a Dalek can tell the difference between the Governor's people and our people?
VALMAR: But I can tell the difference, you fool, and I control it.
KEBBLE: We want something better than words.
JANLEY: Test it on me. Will that satisfy you?
KEBBLE: Well yes, but
BEN: She's out of her mind.
VALMAR: Is it all right?
VALMAR: Now, when I tell you to fire
DALEK: I am your servant.
JANLEY: Get back to your places.
KEBBLE: Are you all right?
JANLEY: Of course. I don't take needless risks.
VALMAR: Oh, well done, Janley.
JANLEY: You haven't disarmed the Dalek. Well, go on, take the gun away. We don't want any accidents. Now, what about the girl?
KEBBLE: We've got her safely locked up. Never fear.
JANLEY: I think the best thing for us to do is
BEN: Hear that? Maybe they'll say were she is.
JANLEY: Who's there?
BEN: You stay there, I'll distract them. Find out where Polly is.
JANLEY: No!
BEN: Help! Help!
JANLEY: The guards will have heard that! Come on we've got to get out of here! Take him and lock him up! Quick! Out!
BRAGEN: You might as well come out. We know you're there.
DOCTOR: Bragen.
BRAGEN: Of course. Who else is fitted to be leader of the rebels?
DOCTOR: No doubt you want to be leader of the Daleks too.
BRAGEN: I am the leader of the Daleks.
DOCTOR: Well, see if you can stop this one from killing me.
BRAGEN: Stop! You heard me, that's an order. Turn away. Fetch the guard.
DALEK: I obey.
DOCTOR: You hope to have it both ways, Bragen. But how will you look in front of the Governor, when I explain your dual role to him?
BRAGEN: The Governor will hardly listen to an impostor.
DOCTOR: An impostor? How do you propose to prove that?
BRAGEN: My guards are now going to produce the body of the real Examiner from the mercury swamp.
DOCTOR: The one you murdered.
BRAGEN: The one you pretended to be.
DOCTOR: Murder's a far worse crime than impersonation.
BRAGEN: Yes, but you can't prove I'm a murderer, while I can prove that you're an impostor.
BRAGEN: Take this man away. Detain him.
JANLEY: A dangerous man.
BRAGEN: Now the only one left is the Governor.
JANLEY: Perhaps we should have dealt with the Examiner earlier.
BRAGEN: I'll deal with him in time, and Quinn.
QUINN: You're the last man I expected to see here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Works by sound, does it?
QUINN: I'm speaking to you, Examiner.
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm sorry.
QUINN: If you'd listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be locked up here now.
DOCTOR: Well, your imprisonment hasn't been entirely wasted. It's brought your enemy out into the open.
QUINN: Bragen? I've known that all along.
DOCTOR: Yes. But did you know that he was the leader of the rebels?
QUINN: Bragen, the leader?
DOCTOR: Yes. It's quite a simple sort of lock, really.
QUINN: Hensell's trouble is he thinks he can run this colony on his personality alone.
DOCTOR: But even if he knew of the danger, could he do anything? The rebels are well organised.
QUINN: The Governor's popular. He can count on the mine workers at the perimeter for support.
DOCTOR: In that case we must get word to him.
QUINN: If you'd done your job properly, Examiner, you wouldn't be here now, and I'd have been out too.
DOCTOR: Ah yes, but then I'm not the real Examiner.
DOCTOR: Ben, Polly and I, we're just travellers, that's all. I found the Examiner dead. Bragen murdered him.
QUINN: Everything leads back friend Bragen. Just give me a chance get my hands on him.
DOCTOR: We aren't going to have that chance unless we can get out of here.
QUINN: There's just a little matter of the cell doors.
DALEK 2: You sent for me?
DALEK: Take up a position at the communications room. Watch and report.
DALEK 2: I obey.
LESTERSON: They're conspiring together! Oh, why didn't I realise? The Examiner was right. They are evil!
LESTERSON: There are four. They can't be reproducing!
DALEK: Dalek nine complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
NEW DALEK:  We are the new race of Daleks.
DALEK: Dalek ten complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek eleven complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek twelve complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek thirteen complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek fourteen complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek fifteen complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek sixteen complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek seventeen complete.
DALEK 2: Check.
DALEK: Dalek eighteen complete.
Episode Five
JANLEY: What's the matter? What is it? Are you ill?
LESTERSON: They're in there, making themselves! Duplicating!
JANLEY: What? What are you talking about?
LESTERSON: I started this, opening the capsule.
JANLEY: Lesterson!
LESTERSON: Don't try to stop me!
JANLEY: What happened?
LESTERSON: They forget that I control them. I gave them life back again, and now I've taken it away. Finished it, stopped it.
JANLEY: The Daleks?
LESTERSON: Evil. Horrible. I know what I'm going to do. Laser torches. Melt them down. I'm going to melt the Daleks down to pools of metal.
JANLEY: You won't, Lesterson.
LESTERSON: Oh, do you think I care what you can do? Go on, tell everybody I was responsible for Resno's death. I don't care! I'm going to wipe out the Daleks! Yes, tell everybody all about me! I'm still going to I'm going to wipe out the Daleks!
LESTERSON: Get me the Examiner. Prison? Who put him there? But I've got to talk to him! I've got to, don't you understand?
LESTERSON: How did you get there? I cut off the power.
DALEK: We can store power. We will soon have our own.
LESTERSON: Own power?
DALEK: Why was the capsule door closed?
LESTERSON: Own power! Argh!
DALEK: Seal off the capsule's secret entrance.
DALEK 2: I obey.
DALEK: Wait! No more than three Daleks to be seen together at any one time.
DALEK 2: I obey.
DALEK: We are not ready yet to teach these human beings the law of the Daleks.
LESTERSON: You can help me!
GUARD: What's the matter?
LESTERSON: Where's the Examiner?
GUARD: The Examiner's in prison.
LESTERSON: Oh, yes.
GUARD: What's the matter with you?
LESTERSON: I forgot.
GUARD: What are you running for? Hey!
JANLEY: Did Lesterson come back?
DALEK: No. Why is this human restricted?
JANLEY: She's against the Daleks. Afraid, are you? Nothing's going to happen to you if you behave.
POLLY: The Daleks? Of course I'm afraid, and so should you be.
JANLEY: The Daleks are going to help us.
POLLY: Us being the rebels, I suppose.
JANLEY: If you like.
POLLY: And when you've won, the Daleks will just go back to being servants again? You're bigger fools than I thought.
DALEK: We are your servants.
POLLY: While it suits you.
JANLEY: You'll see.
KEBBLE: In!
KEBBLE: You want me to stay with her?
JANLEY: Yes. You may have to help Valmar. He'll be here in a minute to fix up the new Dalek power cable.
KEBBLE: Right.
DALEK: When will the work be completed?
JANLEY: What is this cable you Daleks are laying, anyway?
DALEK: Daleks operate on static electricity.
JANLEY: Static! Is that possible?
DALEK: To create static, the Daleks need a complete cable circuit.
JANLEY: I see. You convert our electricity into your own power.
DALEK: That is correct. When will the human being complete the work?
JANLEY: He'll be here. It's easier now. There's no-one to interfere with our plans.
QUINN: Do you have to do that? I'm afraid you'll find these locks are foolproof.
DOCTOR: I wonder how they're converting the power?
QUINN: What are you talking about?
DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're powered by static electricity. It's like blood to them, a constant life-stream.
QUINN: Static isn't workable.
DOCTOR: It is to the Daleks. They've conquered static, just as they've conquered anti-magnetics.
QUINN: I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.
DOCTOR: I don't seem to be able to hit the right note. Do you have any more water?
QUINN: I hope not. No.
DOCTOR: Then I shall have to get some.
GUARD: You can't!
LESTERSON: But it's important! It's desperately important!
GUARD: Well, Bragen gave orders.
LESTERSON: Just get out of my way! Ah! Examiner! The Daleks !
DOCTOR: Yes?
LESTERSON: They're duplicating! I've seen them! They've got their own power now! I can't stop them!
GUARD: Take him to Bragen.
LESTERSON: Oh! Oh! Oh!
DOCTOR: I say. I say, do you think we might have a little more water?
QUINN: Is that all you can say? Lesterson fights his way down here to speak to you and all you can do is demand more water?
GUARD: Get away from the door.
QUINN: Sorry about that outburst. I thought it might help the situation.
QUINN: Nearly, nearly.
BRAGEN: What's this?
GUARD: He tried to break in and speak with the Examiner.
LESTERSON: What is the Dalek doing?!
BRAGEN: I thought you knew. Something to do with the emergency power supply.
LESTERSON: Oh, no. It's a trick. I didn't ask for it.
BRAGEN: Lesterson, I've had reports.
LESTERSON: What are you doing?!
DALEK: Laying the new emergency power supply as you ordered, master.
LESTERSON: It's a lie!
BRAGEN: I've had reports of your incomprehensible behaviour.
LESTERSON: Yes. Yes, but I can explain if you'll get rid of that!
BRAGEN: Finish now.
DALEK: I am your servant.
LESTERSON: Where is the Governor?!
BRAGEN: At the perimeter. Why?
LESTERSON: Call him. Get him back here as quickly as possible. We're all in terrible danger! The Examiner was right! Right all the time!
LESTERSON: Don't listen to anything she has to say.
JANLEY: Come along now.
LESTERSON: She's in league with the Daleks!
JANLEY: Now, now, now, now. Please, Lesterson. Just take things calmly. You're not well.
LESTERSON: I'm perfectly well!
JANLEY: Please, Lesterson, please. Now, you ought to be in hospital. You promised me you'd report there.
LESTERSON: I promised nothing of the kind.
JANLEY: Don't you remember? Never mind. I understand.
BRAGEN: Pity. It's probably only temporary.
LESTERSON: You're trying to say I'm mad.
BRAGEN: No, no, not mad.
JANLEY: No, of course not. No.
LESTERSON: But I tell you, I saw the Daleks. They were duplicating! I saw it! I swear to you!
JANLEY: He suddenly started saying these things in the lab. I'm afraid he's
LESTERSON: Oh, no! No!
BRAGEN: Keep him under restraint.
LESTERSON: Oh, will nobody listen to me?!
VALMAR: Pass me that small screwdriver.
POLLY: I can't. My hands are tied. Anyway, I wouldn't help you even if I could.
VALMAR: Okay.
VALMAR: More? I can't handle them.
KEBBLE: This is the lot.
POLLY: Listen. The Dalek's gone now.
KEBBLE: That doesn't mean you can start talking.
VALMAR: Oh, leave her alone, Kebble. She isn't doing any harm.
POLLY: You think you're very tough don't you, pushing a girl around. I'd like to see you come up against a real man.
KEBBLE: Like who?
POLLY: Like Ben, for instance.
KEBBLE: Don't worry about him. We've got him safely stowed away.
POLLY: You've got Ben?
KEBBLE: He's sleeping off a slight fall.
VALMAR: I told you to leave her alone.
POLLY: Your name's Valmar, isn't it?
VALMAR: That's it.
POLLY: You want the Daleks to fight the Governor. But don't you see? They'll turn on you, too.
KEBBLE: What? Three big pepper pots?
VALMAR: One of them did kill Resno. And you saw what the Dalek did to that sheet of metal.
POLLY: And that's just the beginning.
KEBBLE: Don't listen to her. She's giving you the Examiner's line.
POLLY: He isn't the Examiner. We're just travellers, landed here by accident. The Doctor, that's the man you think is the Examiner, found the real Examiner dead and picked up his papers.
VALMAR: This Doctor of yours. He knows something about the Daleks?
POLLY: He's tried to warn everyone. It's the only reason we stayed here.
DALEK: When will the work be completed?
VALMAR: I don't know. I'll need a new junction box like this one.
POLLY: You've all underestimated these Daleks.
KEBBLE: Better brains than us, I suppose.
POLLY: I only know what the Doctor has told me. He says they're capable of exterminating whole nations.
VALMAR: Perhaps, but what would they want to kill us for, after we've taken over. We're friendly with the Daleks.
POLLY: But don't you see? Human beings can't be friends with Daleks. They don't have friends.
VALMAR: I don't see why not.
POLLY: It's a kind of hatred for anything unlike themselves. They think they're superior.
VALMAR: The girl's got something.
KEBBLE: You want to tell Janley, you're welcome.
POLLY: Janley! She'll betray the lot of you, if she gets the chance.
DALEK: The other junction box is outside.
VALMAR: Thank you.
KEBBLE: Talk too much, don't you? Didn't you know he was soft on Janley? All right, all right, I'm just putting her straight.
VALMAR: More slack on the cables.
HENSELL: What are all these cables lying about?
GUARD: New emergency power supply.
HENSELL: Who's idea was that?
GUARD: What do you want to know for?
HENSELL: What do I? Don't you know I'm the Governor? Where are you from?
GUARD: The interior, sir.
HENSELL: The interior? Why are you carrying a gun?
GUARD: I'm a Squad Leader in Bragen's guard, sir.
HENSELL: Oh, I see. Bragen's guard, ay? All right, carry on.
GUARD: Cut that row out, you two.
GUARD: What the? Oh!
QUINN: Come on.
DOCTOR: Wait a minute.
DOCTOR: We don't want him trying it, although he seemed a bit tone deaf to me.
HENSELL: Well, Bragen, these trips are becoming more and more demanding.
BRAGEN: I didn't expect you, Governor.
HENSELL: Oh, I had as much as I could stand. Well, what's been happening here?
BRAGEN: One moment.
HENSELL: I asked you a question, man.
BRAGEN: I heard you.
HENSELL: Look, your work can wait. You can hand over to me tomorrow. I want to hear about the Examiner.
BRAGEN: The Examiner is at present in jail.
HENSELL: In jail? That's rather dangerous, isn't it? Who put him there?
BRAGEN: I did.
HENSELL: You did? In heaven's sake, why?
BRAGEN: He's an impostor, Governor. Possibly a murderer as well. We've just discovered the body of the real Examiner in the mercury swamp.
HENSELL: I hope you're sure of your facts, Bragen.
BRAGEN: Quite sure.
HENSELL: This could have far reaching consequences.
BRAGEN: As far as I am concerned, there's nothing more to be said. So if there's nothing further
HENSELL: Nothing further? Who the devil do you think you're talking to? Stand up when you're speaking to me, man!
BRAGEN: I prefer to remain seated.
HENSELL: Do you now? We'll soon see about that. Guards! Take this man out of my office. Did you hear what I said? That's an order!
BRAGEN: You forget, my dear Hensell. They're not your guards, they're mine.
HENSELL: I am the Governor.
BRAGEN: No. Not now. I am.
HENSELL: Oh, I see. Your guards, ay? Yes, Quinn warned me about your guards, but we all took them too lightly, didn't we? But we'll soon change that.
HENSELL: You imbecile! How long do you think your handful of guards can hang out when the people hear that I am being kept a prisoner in my own capital?
BRAGEN: The people will do exactly as they are told, Hensell. It will, of course, be easier for them if you co-operate with us.
BRAGEN: Wait there. Guards, dismissed.
HENSELL: So, Bragen, you want my cooperation, do you?
BRAGEN: It would save bloodshed. I might even let you keep the title of Governor.
HENSELL: Might you now? I'll tell you what you will do. You'll order your guards to disarm and place yourself under arrest immediately!
BRAGEN: So you reject my offer. I thought it a generous one in the circumstances.
HENSELL: What circumstances?
BRAGEN: Look at this.
HENSELL: What is it?
BRAGEN: The reason that the colony is now mine.
HENSELL: Is it a weapon of some kind?
BRAGEN: I'll arrange a demonstration for you. Do you still refuse my offer?
HENSELL: I will not be intimidated.
BRAGEN: Of course not. In character to the last, Hensell. Kill him!
DALEK: Why do human beings kill human beings?
BRAGEN: Get on with your work.
DALEK: Yes, master. I obey.
BRAGEN: Yes, obey me! From now on, I'll have complete obedience from everyone!
VALMAR: I'll have to check the cable circuit now. Otherwise it's just as you asked for.
DALEK: Very well.
VALMAR: Why can't you carry on with the power you're drawing from the colony? Why go to all this trouble?
DALEK: Until now, we have had to recharge from the colony supply. With static power, the Daleks will be twice as  useful.
JANLEY: Valmar, quick!
VALMAR: What's the matter?
JANLEY: The Governor's back.
VALMAR: What about the girl?
JANLEY: Leave her.
DALEK: I will follow you.
VALMAR: What for?
DALEK: I am your servant.
JANLEY: Come on.
DOCTOR: An electrical circuit of their own supplying static electricity! I wonder how much longer we've got?
DOCTOR : I didn't realise they'd have a circuit of their own.
POLLY: Doctor, look out!
POLLY: Are you all right?
DOCTOR: Well done! Who was the man who went outside just now?
POLLY: Valmar. He's been working for the Daleks.
DOCTOR: On their static power supply.
POLLY: Doctor, they've got Ben.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know. He ran away so that I could. Oh well, it's a long story. But don't worry, that boy can take care of himself.
QUINN: Did you hear that? That won't help.
DOCTOR: Get out, all of you!
QUINN: What about you?
POLLY: But Doctor!
DOCTOR: Go!
DALEK 2: Have they escaped?
DALEK: Yes, return to capsule and report.
DALEK 2: I obey.
DALEK: We are to wait here until the human beings fight among themselves.
DALEK 2: Then we will strike.
DALEK: And exterminate!
ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
QUINN: The one man who could have saved us.
DOCTOR: Don't worry. The people will follow you, too.
QUINN: Maybe. But there wasn't any maybe about Hensell. He was old-fashioned, single-minded, yes, but he's done a lot of wonderful work for this colony. Events turned out against him, that's all. But why? Why was he killed?
BRAGEN: I can answer that.
BRAGEN: He wanted to destroy the Daleks, so one of them killed him. Now I'm declaring martial law. You will be returned to prison and properly guarded this time.
DOCTOR: Martial law? What good do you think that will do against the Daleks?
BRAGEN: The Daleks will do as I tell them.
DOCTOR: We shall see, shan't we.
BRAGEN: Take them away.
ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
DALEK 2: Orders received. Exterminate all humans!
DALEK: Exterminate all humans!
DALEK 2: Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!
ALL DALEKS: Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy! Daleks conquer and destroy!
Episode Six
DALEK: Take up positions, ready to exterminate all human beings.
DALEK 3: Exterminate!
ALL DALEKS: Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
GUARD: Move on!
DOCTOR: The Dalek!
POLLY: What about it?
DOCTOR: Can't you see it's armed?
GUARD: Keep moving!
DALEK: This area is restricted.
QUINN: On whose authority?
GUARD: Silence!
DALEK: Repeat. This area is restricted.
DALEK 2: Obey or you shall be exterminated.
QUINN: I thought they obeyed us?
POLLY: What do we do now, Doctor?
QUINN: This way.
DALEK: They will be exterminated.
JANLEY: We've won. The revolution's over. I'll pass the word to Valmar, Kebble and the rest.
BRAGEN: Wait. The revolution is not quite over yet.
JANLEY: What more can we do? Hensell's dead, you're the new Governor. The battle's over.
BRAGEN: Not quite. You mentioned Kebble, Valmar and that rabble. Well, now they must be dealt with.
JANLEY: But those are our own men.
BRAGEN: Of course.
JANLEY: I don't understand.
BRAGEN: Do you think I can ever be secure in that chair while that rabble are still loose? They rebelled against Hensell yesterday. Tomorrow it'll be my turn. Well, let them rebel. Tell them the guards have taken control. Let them attack, and then we can crush them utterly.
JANLEY: You say we.
BRAGEN: Yes. We've come a long way together, you and I. Are you going to back down now?
JANLEY: Couldn't you just arrest them?
BRAGEN: Everyone must be killed.
JANLEY: Must they all be slaughtered?
BRAGEN: All of them.
BRAGEN: Well, are you still with me?
JANLEY: I suppose so.
BRAGEN: Then do as I say.
BRAGEN: I'm glad you agreed with me.
DOCTOR: Now!
BEN: What have you brought me in here for?
VALMAR: Quiet!
BEN: Whose side are you on anyway?
VALMAR: I thought I was going to be on the winning side.
BEN: What changed your mind?
VALMAR: Bragen. The colony's become too small for him. He wants us out of the way now.
BEN: Yeah, well, it often happens that way, mate, when you follow blokes like him.
VALMAR: Look, I'm going to try and get your friends here, if I can. So wait here.
GUARD : Section one reporting, Governor Bragen.
BRAGEN: Yes.
GUARD : The rebels are gathering. We've got them under observation.
BRAGEN: Don't let them concentrate in large groups. Hit them before they organise. They'll be making their move any time now.
GUARD : Right.
BRAGEN: People of Vulcan. This is your new Governor talking to you. I have to announce that Governor Hensell has been murdered by the rebels. I have taken control temporarily until order is restored. People living on the perimeter and in the interior can stay calm. We know who the murderers are.
BRAGEN : I shall keep you informed of events as soon as I am able, so listen for the signal to watch your communication sets. That is all.
DOCTOR: Ah! There you are.
POLLY: Ben!
DOCTOR: I knew you'd be all right!
BEN: Polly, you okay?
POLLY: Oh, yes.
BEN: Did Valmar find you, then?
POLLY: Valmar? No.
QUINN: What's this about Valmar?
BEN: Well it seems Bragen's gone power mad. He wants the rebels to revolt, then he can finish them off.
DOCTOR: The Daleks won't care who they fight. They'll exterminate every human being on this planet.
POLLY: Doctor, oh please, let's go back to the Tardis.
DOCTOR: Quinn, keep them both here.
BEN: Well, wait a minute, Doctor!
BEN: All right. All right.
QUINN: Now what do you think he's up to?
DALEK : Orders received. Daleks commence extermination.
ALL DALEKS : Exterminate! Exterminate! Exterminate!
KEBBLE: Just a minute, Examiner.
GUARD: All right, hold it!
DOCTOR: Down everyone!
VALMAR: Don't come any nearer.
JANLEY: What do you mean?
VALMAR: I overheard your conversation with Bragen. But you can't stand up to the Daleks, so your plan will come to nothing.
JANLEY: Not my plan. Bragen's.
VALMAR: But that's the same thing.
JANLEY: Not any more.
VALMAR: You expect me to believe that?
JANLEY: Look, Val, he was going to kill me too. I came here to do exactly what you've done. Let Bragen see what the Daleks are like. He doesn't know how strong they are. He's got to be stopped.
DALEK: You will lead us to the middle of your party of human beings.
VALMAR: Yes.
DALEK: We will fight  for you.
JANLEY: Believe me, Val, it's the only way to save all our lives.
VALMAR: Did you know that the Daleks are duplicating?
JANLEY: Yes.
DALEK: But we are your friends.
DALEK 2: We will serve you.
DALEK 3: Take us to the centre of your group.
VALMAR: Can we trust them?
JANLEY: We must! The guards have orders to wipe us out. We must use the Daleks. Come on.
POLLY: Doctor!
DOCTOR: The window. Does it open?
BEN: I don't know.
DOCTOR: It had better, or we're done for! Out you go.
POLLY: What's happening?
DOCTOR: The Daleks. They're teeming all over the corridors. We've got to get back to Lesterson's lab.
BRAGEN: This is Governor Bragen speaking. A group of rebels is attempting to take over the colony. It is the duty of all loyal citizens to help the guards resist. Stay in your homes. Order will be restored. Listen to my bulletins.
GUARD: The rebels are using the Daleks against our people!
BRAGEN: Well, get back and fight! Why do you come running to me? What do you think your guns are for?
GUARD: Well, the guns don't work against them!
BRAGEN: Get back and fight them!
JANLEY: There and there!
JANLEY: Over there! No! No! Over there! They're our people!
VALMAR: Cut the Dalek gun off!
JANLEY: No!
VALMAR: I told you to cut the gun off!
JANLEY: I did!
VALMAR: You've killed our own people!
VALMAR: We have to dismantle the gun, that's all.
JANLEY: Oh, look at it!
DALEK: Your usefulness is over.
JANLEY: Come on! Quick, Val. Come on!
POLLY: Doctor, it's stupid to hide in here!
BEN: Well, do you fancy your chances outside in the corridor? No thanks.
DOCTOR: The answer must be here somewhere.
LESTERSON: Shh!
LESTERSON: You must be absolutely quiet. They know everything that's going on. Everything! They even know what you're thinking.
BEN: Where do they get their power from, Lesterson?
LESTERSON: Ah, I tried to turn the power off, but they were miles ahead of me. Marvellous creatures. You have to admire them.
BEN: But we've got to stop them!
LESTERSON: Oh, it's too late for that. They're the new species, you see, taking over from homo sapiens. Man's had his day. Finished now.
DALEK: The static circuit is nearly complete.
DALEK 2: Soon we can abandon the power we are using.
DALEK: The humans are being exterminated.
BEN: Did you hear that? They're going to use their own power.
DOCTOR: The cables they laid. The trick I tried before won't work anymore.
LESTERSON: Oh, if that's no good now, we're finished. All we can do is marvel at the creatures who are taking our place.
VALMAR: No!
JANLEY: Come on!
VALMAR: Don't be a fool.
JANLEY: Come on!
BEN: Take it easy, Polly.
POLLY: Can't we do anything?! They're murdering everybody, one by one!
BEN: You've done all this. Why'd you give them power in the first place?
LESTERSON: Well, I could control it, you see. And then Janley got one of her men, Valmar, I think it was, yes, and he rigged up a secret cable. It's carrying power directly from the colony's supply.
DOCTOR: Where? Where is it, Lesterson?
LESTERSON: Valmar's the only one who can answer that. Or the Daleks of course. They know everything. Yes, you should ask the Daleks.
BEN: Then we must find Valmar.
DOCTOR: No. You stay here and look after Polly. I'll go.
MAN : Come on. This way. 
QUINN: You'll have to leave her now, Valmar.
VALMAR: She wasn't as bad as you think.
DOCTOR: Valmar! Where is the Dalek power?
QUINN: Get down, both of you!
DOCTOR: Valmar. Valmar! Where is the Dalek power supply?
QUINN: We've got to stop them, Valmar. She's dead. There's nothing you can do for her.
VALMAR: The main cable's inside the capsule, but there's nothing you can do.
QUINN: There must be some way of cutting off the power!
DOCTOR: What makes you think I want to do that? We need more time. I know. A diversion. Bragen's guards. We'll have to use them to keep the Daleks busy. You go to Bragen.
BRAGEN: Section One, where's your report? Are you there, Section one? Section two? Section two? Why don't they answer? Can you hear me, Section two? Section three? Oh, why don't they answer? I'm their Governor. Why don't they answer?
BRAGEN : This is Bragen speaking. I'm speaking to the Daleks. Daleks, listen to me. I am the Governor. You must work for me. Do not trust the rebels. I will give you whatever you want, but immobilise your guns. This is the Governor speaking.
BEN: He's nuts, trying to talk to the Daleks.
BEN: Lesterson, what's in that cupboard?
LESTERSON: Nothing. It's quite empty.
BEN: Well, come on, Polly, we'll be safe in there, love.
BRAGEN: Do you hear me, Daleks?! You will obey my orders!
QUINN: No use, Bragen. The Daleks have stopped obeying your orders.
BRAGEN: Guards!
QUINN: Dead! The Daleks have killed them. You still have your guard units in the interior. How long will it take them to get here?
BRAGEN: That depends.
QUINN: Well, get them!
BRAGEN: Well, they will be intercepted by the Daleks.
QUINN: Exactly! It will draw them away from here and give the Doctor a chance to deal with them.
BRAGEN: I refuse to allow my guards to be sacrificed.
QUINN: In that case the Daleks will destroy everything on this colony.
BRAGEN: Guards. This is Bragen speaking. All units will report immediately to the capital. Be prepared to face the rebel Daleks. There. Are you satisfied?
QUINN: I hope it works.
DOCTOR: Ben! Polly!
BEN: Doctor, did you hear what Bragen said?
DOCTOR: Yes, I did.
BEN: Well, I only hope the Daleks do go for the guards.
POLLY: A lot of the Daleks went out just now.
DOCTOR: Good, because we're going inside. Come on, Valmar.
DOCTOR: Ben, give us that spare cable over there. Polly, keep watch at the door.
BEN: Well, you know what you're doing?
DOCTOR: Of course I do.
BEN: Well, why can't you just take all the plugs out and cut the power off?
DOCTOR: Because I prefer to do it my way!
POLLY: Look out!
DALEK 2: Static power is being stored. We can dismantle the human electric system.
DALEK: The law of the Daleks is in force.
DALEK 2: Extermination of humans.
DALEK: Our cables have been moved.
LESTERSON: And I could tell you who did it.
DALEK: What were you doing in there?
LESTERSON: I want to help you.
DALEK: Why?
LESTERSON:  I am your servant.
DALEK: We do not need humans now.
LESTERSON: Ah, but you wouldn't kill me. I gave you life.
DALEK: Yes, you gave us life.
DALEK 2: There are two
DALEK: Exterminate! Ah! Ah! Exterminate! 
DALEK: Out of control! Out of Control!
BRAGEN: What happened to it?
QUINN: I don't know.
BRAGEN: It seems that your friend, the Examiner, was successful after all.
BRAGEN: Now I shall restore law and order on this planet.
QUINN: Not your law, Bragen. That's finished for good.
BRAGEN: You'll obey me, or
QUINN: Your day is over, Bragen. No one will obey you now.
BRAGEN: I'm still the Governor, and you will. Valmar!
VALMAR: He was a murderer.
QUINN: Enough of guns. There's a lot of clearing up to be done. We will rebuild together. What is the extent of the damage?
VALMAR: Oh, I don't know if its repairable. The whole electrical system.
QUINN: Are you all right?
BEN: Oh, he's okay. The clot knocked himself out.
QUINN: It's a miracle. How did you do it?
DOCTOR: Eh? What happened? What did I do? What did I do?
BEN: You destroyed the Daleks, that's what you did.
POLLY: No need to be modest about it.
DOCTOR: Did I do that?
POLLY: You know you did.
VALMAR: You used the power from the colony's electric supply, overfed it and blew up their temporary static circuit. Well, didn't you?
DOCTOR: Did I do all that?
VALMAR: You may have stopped the Daleks, but have you any idea of the damage you've done to the colony?
DOCTOR: Oh. There was a blow back, was there?
VALMAR: A blow back? Our power supply has been destroyed! It'll be months before we can get things back to normal.
QUINN: Valmar!
DOCTOR: Oh, that is unfortunate.
VALMAR: But did it have to be this way?
DOCTOR: I did a lot of damage, did I?
QUINN: Come on.
DOCTOR: I think we'd better get out of here before they send us the bill.
BEN: Well, I mean I didn't expect the brass bands to be playing, but I wouldn't have thought a thank you would have hurt anybody.
POLLY: But Ben, think of all those poor people all killed.
BEN: I know, but the Doctor saved the colony from being completely wiped out.
POLLY: Hmm.
BEN: Yeah, and he was telling them all along, but would they listen?
POLLY: Mind you, he wasn't very convincing when he was trying to explain it to Valmar and Quinn and everybody.
BEN: No, he wasn't, was he?
POLLY: Doctor, you did know what you were doing, didn't you?
BEN: Oh, you needn't worry about them anymore, Doctor. Just a heap of old iron now.
