The Underwater Menace
Episode One
JAMIE: What's this?
DOCTOR: You'll find out.
JAMIE: Ah, I don't think I want to.
BEN: It's a machine, my old haggis, which will take us away from Scotland forever.
JAMIE: Where to?
BEN: Ah, well, that as the Doctor would say, that is in the lap of the gods. We never know.
JAMIE: Aye, you'd not be leading me on now, would you? Is it a fact you don't know where we're going?
POLLY: Quite true, and what's more we don't even know what year it will be either.
JAMIE: Ach now, I don't believe it.
DOCTOR: Nae man can tether time nor tide. Robert Burns.
JAMIE: Ay? Who's Robert Burns?
DOCTOR: Oh, I should have remembered.
POLLY: What?
DOCTOR: Well to Jamie, its 1746. Robert Burns wasn't born until 1759.
BEN: Gets sort of complicated, don't it?
JAMIE: What's happening now?
BEN: We're just beginning to land.
DOCTOR: Hold tight, everyone.
JAMIE: Land?
POLLY: Don't be scared, Jamie, it's all right really.
BEN: I get a sort of queer feeling. See we never know what we're going to find, do we?
DOCTOR: Ah, that's the fun. Stand by, here we go.
POLLY: Please let it be Chelsea 1966.
BEN: Hope it's the Daleks, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Prehistoric monsters.
JAMIE: What have I come upon?
JAMIE: That wasn't too bad. Let's go outside, Doctor.
BEN: Yeah, come on, Jamie, you and me first. Well, you never know, you know.
JAMIE: What?
BEN: We don't know what's going to be waiting for us out there, do we? Come on, Doctor, open up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I don't see why not. It looks all right to me.  Wait!
DOCTOR: For me.
.
POLLY: This time I'll guess where we are.
DOCTOR: All right then, where are we?
POLLY: Cornwall.
BEN: Ah, you said that last time.
POLLY: And I was right.
JAMIE: The Isles, maybe.
BEN: Don't you know?
DOCTOR: Haven't a clue. Not the isles of Britain, anyway.
POLLY: How can you tell?
DOCTOR: This rock. It's volcanic. It's not very old either.
BEN: How old?
DOCTOR: Oh, miocene.
BEN + POLLY: What?
DOCTOR: It's only about 25 million years old. Look.
BEN: Hey, that's an extinct volcano, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Possibly, possibly.
JAMIE: Are we not going for a wee look round?
POLLY: Yes, lets. Come on.
POLLY: Oh, give us a hand.
BEN: Here.
BEN: I don't reckon we're going to see much when we get there.
POLLY: Ben?
BEN: What now?
POLLY: I'm beginning to see things.
BEN: Where?
POLLY: Down there, look. I'm sure I saw something moving.
BEN: Ah, you're round the twist.
POLLY: Look, there it is again.
BEN: You see anything?
JAMIE: Nothing.
POLLY: Ben, I think we ought to go back.
BEN: No, not me, I'm having a dekko down here.
JAMIE: Yeah, me too.
POLLY: Wait for me!
 POLLY: Oh, can't we stop and have a breather?
JAMIE: Ben and I'll go on. You stay here.
POLLY: Oh, no.
BEN: We shan't be long, love, back before you know it.
POLLY: All right.
BEN: Hey, that's Polly.
BEN: Polly? Polly?
JAMIE: She must have gone inside.
BEN: Hang on, I've got a torch.
BEN: Polly?
DOCTOR: Mediterranean. Oh no, tidal sea, can't be. That's funny, it hasn't been fired long.
.
BEN: Polly?
BEN: Polly, where are you?
JAMIE: Polly?
BEN: What's that?
POLLY: Ben, Jamie, is it you?
BEN: Who do you think it is?
JAMIE: Are you all right, Polly?
POLLY: Yes.
BEN: When you're finished get us out of this contraption.
POLLY: I can't. They've tied me up.
JAMIE: Who are they?
POLLY: I don't know, I didn't see them.
BEN: That's all we needed.
DOCTOR: So they caught you too.
BEN: Left half me stomach behind.
JAMIE: Aye, me too.
POLLY: Where are we going?
DOCTOR: That we shall find out very soon.
POLLY: Wherever it is it's an awful long way down.
DOCTOR: Yes, we must be below sea level already.
JAMIE: It's difficult to breathe.
BEN: What is it, Doctor?
POLLY: It's a funny taste. I don't feel very well.
DOCTOR: Here we are.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, don't be frightened anybody. If we pass out it's compressed nitrogen. It's called caissons disease.
BEN: Polly, try and get us out of here.
POLLY: I'll try.
DOCTOR: Oh.
BEN: Where's this? Polly? Jamie?
JAMIE: Oh.
BEN: Come on, man, rise and shine.
JAMIE: Would you disturb the dead.
BEN: Oh you're not dead, you just got a touch of the submariners', that's all.
JAMIE: What are they?
BEN: It'd take too long to explain now. This must be some sort of compression chamber.
DOCTOR: Troglodytes.
BEN: What?
DOCTOR: Ancient tribes from North Africa who lived in caves. Possibly, possibly. Where's my diary?
BEN: Cave men? Hey, Jamie, you better watch it. With that kilt someone might mistake you for a bird.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's difficult to put a precise date on these people.
POLLY: I don't think it is.
DOCTOR: All right then, when?
POLLY: Oh, I'd say about 1970.
DOCTOR: Can you prove it?
BEN: Yeah, go on, prove it.
JAMIE: How d'you know, Polly?
BEN: Ah, she's been studying her crystal ball.
POLLY: Abracadabra.
DOCTOR: Oh, how interesting, yes. Hmm. It's Aztec. Fake of course.
BEN: Mexico Olympiad.
POLLY: When we first left Earth it hadn't happened yet.
BEN: No, that's right, it wasn't due till 1968.
POLLY: Right, so now is any time later than that.
JAMIE: Later? Oh, I wish I understood.
BEN: Polly, you speak foreign. Go and talk to him. Ask him where we are.
POLLY: Er, parlez-vous francais? Sprechen Sie deutsch? Habla si espanol?
GUARD: Bazumi tampost postu!
JAMIE: Au Gaelic akye?
BEN: What's that?
JAMIE: Gaelic.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that means move in any language. I think we'd better comply. Women and children last. Polly?
.
DOCTOR: Oh food.
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you.
DOCTOR: This is good.
DOCTOR: This is very good. Mmmm. It's delicious. This is excellent. Sit down, sit down. This is ambrosia.
BEN: What's got into him?
POLLY: I don't know. I've never seen him go for food like this before. It's usually hats.
JAMIE: Better hurry or he'll scoff the lot.
BEN: What is it?
DOCTOR: Plankton.
JAMIE: Plankton? What's that?
DOCTOR: Well, it's small plants and animals from the sea.
POLLY: Animals?
BEN: Yeah, little spidery ones.
POLLY: Oh, I don't think I'm very hungry, thank you.
DOCTOR: You'd better get used to it. I don't expect there's much else to be had around here. Visitors!
DOCTOR: Good day to you.
RAMO: We've been expecting you.
POLLY: He speaks English.
BEN: What does he mean, he's been expecting us? We didn't know we were coming ourselves.
RAMO: The living goddess Amdo sees and hears all.
DOCTOR: And she had a message about us? For you?
RAMO: Yes. She told us you would fall from the sky in time for our festival of the vernal equinox.
DOCTOR: And just what part are we to play in this festival of the vernal equinox?
RAMO: A very important part, I regret to say. Guards.
DOCTOR: No! Wait! I have something important to say.
RAMO: Be quick and say it then.
DOCTOR: I won't speak under threats!
RAMO: You have five minutes in which to make your point. After that you will join your companions. The ceremony will proceed.
POLLY: Doctor?
RAMO: Go, girl.
DOCTOR: What will happen to them?
RAMO: They will come to no harm. Yet.
DOCTOR: You'll have to go, Polly.
RAMO: Now, stranger, say what you have to and do not waste time. There is very little of it left for any of you.
DOCTOR: What I have to say concerns a certain Professor Zaroff.
RAMO: What do you know of Zaroff?
DOCTOR: A great deal. He's here, isn't he?
RAMO: How did you know?
DOCTOR: The food. It couldn't be anyone else but Zaroff. He led the field in producing food from the sea. His progress is astonishing.
RAMO: You are a friend of Zaroff's?
DOCTOR: Just send him this message, and you'll see.
RAMO: I will take no message to Zaroff.
DOCTOR: You're making a big mistake!
RAMO: Yes, what is it, Ara?
ARA: I've come to clear the table.
RAMO: Yes, yes, we've wasted enough time.
DOCTOR: Ara, take this message to Professor Zaroff.
ARA: But I
POLLY: I'm scared. What are they going to do to us?
JAMIE: I don't see the Doctor here. He's escaped, maybe.
BEN: Ah, some chance of that.
JAMIE: Oh, he's a canny one, yon Doctor. Dinna fash yourself, Polly.
RAMO: Quiet! You profane the sacred temple with your idle chatter.
.
ARA: I must speak to Professor Zaroff.
ARA: Well, Damon then.
JAMIE: Ben, should we run for it?
BEN: No, wait till we hear from the Doctor.
POLLY: It'd be better.
JAMIE: Put me down.
POLLY: Ben? The Doctor isn't coming!
BEN: Don't worry. As long as he's not here, there's still some hope.
BEN: Oh, no.
DAMON: Well, girl, what do you want? Why are you not at your work?
ARA: I have a note for Professor Zaroff. It's very important.
DAMON: A note for Zaroff? Let me see. Oh, come, girl.
LOLEM: Life is a stream of water that drains away even as time does, and cannot be reclaimed.
LOLEM: Accept, oh mighty and powerful Amdo, these, your sacrifices.
POLLY: Doctor!
DOCTOR: Hold on! Hold on for your lives.
DAMON: Here is the note.
DOCTOR: Don't move. Don't even breathe.
ZAROFF: Stop the ceremony!
RAMO: You dare to interfere with the hour of sacrifice?
ZAROFF: I do not interfere with your sacrifices, but I must first speak with that man. Release him.
RAMO: Release him.
ZAROFF: Now, this information you have, what is it?
DOCTOR: First, release my friends.
ZAROFF: I do not care about your friends. Your information, quick!
DOCTOR: But I do. Professor Zaroff, if anything happens to them, you'll never know the secret I was going to tell you.
ZAROFF: You! All right, release them. Take them to the labour controller. He will know what to do with them. Well, Doctor?
DOCTOR: First, let me say how glad I am to see that the reports of your death twenty years previously are a little premature.
ZAROFF: The whole world believed I had been kidnapped.
DOCTOR: The East blamed the West. The West, the East.
ZAROFF: Oh, I wish I could have been there.
DOCTOR: Now here you are, the greatest scientific genius since Leonardo, under the sea. You must have a fantastic story to tell?
ZAROFF: Perhaps I tell you someday, if you will live long enough to hear. Now this vital secret, what is it? I must know.
DOCTOR: I haven't got one.
ZAROFF: How dare you!
DOCTOR: But I'm sure a that great man like you wouldn't want a modern scientific brain like mine to be sacrificed to a heathen idol?
ZAROFF: You know I could have you torn to bits by my guards, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ZAROFF: I could feed you to my pet octopus, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes.
ZAROFF: Well you have sense of humour. I too have sense of humour. I need men like you.  You come with me, yes?
DOCTOR: I come with you.
DAMON: Your lives have been spared. See that they contribute useful service to the community.
BEN: Anything you say, mate.
DAMON: What was that?
BEN: Oh, nothing, nothing.
DAMON: You men look strong. You'll be sent to the mines. Take them away.
BEN: What?
JAMIE: What does he mean, mines?
BEN: Now wait a minute. Now what are you going to do with her?
POLLY: Yes, what?
DAMON: I shall decide that later.
JAMIE: Don't lose heart, Polly!
DAMON: Don't be afraid, girl. Life is very beautiful under the sea. Come along.
DAMON: Seventy percent of the world's surface is under the oceans. You are looking at our food producing area. Without it, we couldn't survive.
POLLY: It's fantastic. What are those?
DAMON: Those are our farmers.
POLLY: I think it's splendid. All those people working under the sea to feed the others. But listen, how do they breathe?
DAMON: We give them plastic gills. Look.
DAMON: That surprises you, doesn't it?
POLLY: It's breathtaking. Oh, sorry. That wasn't meant to be a pun.
DAMON: No, not at all. No, I'm glad you're taking it like this. Some people get most upset when they find they're to have the operation.
POLLY: Operation?
FOREMAN: Well, of course. We couldn't send you out there without it. You'd drown.
POLLY: You're not turning me into a fish!
.
DOCTOR: Just give me a clue, Professor.
ZAROFF: West of Gibraltar, south of the Azores. The Atlantic ridge, what does that suggest to you?
DOCTOR: Ancient temples under the sea. But that's not possible! That's only a legend.
ZAROFF: Go on, go on, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We're on the ancient kingdom of Atlantis.
ZAROFF: Yes, yes, and this is not the perfect place to complete my work?
DOCTOR: But how did you get them to accept you? Surely science is in opposition to ancient temple ritual and idol worship?
ZAROFF: I gave them a sugar-coated pill. I have promised to lift Atlantis out of the sea.
ZAROFF: Yes, what is it? Pardon me, Doctor.
ARA: Doctor? Doctor?
DOCTOR: What is it, Ara?
ARA: It's the girl. They're going to carry out the fish operation on her.
DOCTOR: Fish operation? Well, well, well. Ara, do you know where the main fuses are?
ARA: Fuses?
DOCTOR: Oh, never mind. Go back to Polly, and if the chance comes, get her away from there! Will you do that for me?
ARA: Yes.
ZAROFF: Doctor!
.
POLLY: Keep away!
DAMON: Bring her here.
DAMON: Don't be difficult, girl, it's quite painless. Lights.
POLLY: No! no!
DAMON: We're ready now.
POLLY: No! No! No! No! No! No!
DAMON: One tiny jab, and you'll know nothing more about it until it's all over.
Episode Two
ZAROFF: And so you see, my friend, it is all so simple. When Atlantis was submerged at the time of the flood, some life continued in air pockets in the mountain's caves, thanks to the natural air shaft provided by the extinct volcano.
ZAROFF: You like my laboratory, yes? You find all this very impressive, no?
DOCTOR: No, not a bit, not a bit.
ZAROFF: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: I expected nothing less from the great Professor Zaroff.
DAMON: The lights are playing up again. Go and see what's wrong. No, wait. I'd better go myself. Zaroff might listen to me. Look after the girl.
NURSE: Right.
ZAROFF: Yes, we have come a long way in our research, and luckily the riches of Atlantis have provided ample means.
ZAROFF: Ah, so you are hungry today? Did I forget to feed you? Is beautiful, no?
DAMON: Zaroff!
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Can't you see I am talking with my friend here.
DAMON: This won't wait. If I am to operate on the girl, I must have light.
ZAROFF: One operation, one girl. You are making an unnecessary fuss.
DAMON: I know what's going on. You're using so much voltage on the project that all civil use is curtailed.
ZAROFF: Ridiculous. I will show you. You follow me. Open the panel. Ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the civil supply. There's never anything wrong. Look, the supply to your clinic is always adequate and cannot be affected by demands elsewhere.
DAMON: Zaroff!
ZAROFF: The fault must lie at your own intake.
DAMON: It's easy to make excuses.
ZAROFF: Excuses! Who taught you, Damon? Everything you know, I've taught you. As I made you, so I can break you.
NURSE: So Zaroff will listen to him. You'd better go and get some light from somewhere. You'll find some in the old quarters. Don't worry, prisoner, we won't keep you waiting long. Ah, you, girl, come here. Keep watch on the prisoner while I search for fuses. And don't try any tricks, understand, or it will be worse for you.
ARA: I understand.
ARA: Girl?
POLLY: What?
ARA: Don't speak, just follow me.
POLLY: But I can't see anything.
ARA: Hold my hand. I'm used to the dark. Hurry, before they get back.
DOCTOR: I can't think of how I came to be so clumsy. I must have bumped into it.
DAMON: You're not clumsy, Doctor. You did it on purpose. But you won't save the girl.
ZAROFF: Oh no, Doctor, you are staying here with me.
DOCTOR: As your prisoner?
ZAROFF: Let us say as my guest.
ARA: It's all clear, come on.
POLLY: Oh, I feel as though I've run a hundred miles. But where?
ARA: I know where to hide you. Come on.
ZAROFF: Damon? Ha, he's just an Atlantean, a primitive. Clever, but no vision.
DOCTOR: Professor, you have offered these people a very big sugar-coated pill to make them accept you, yes?
ZAROFF: I turned their dreams and prophecies to my own means.
DOCTOR: The dreams of a people living on a drowned continent must be.
ZAROFF: To lift Atlantis from the ocean. Make it dry land again.
DOCTOR: Exactly. But now, how are you going to do it? Even a genius like you.
ZAROFF: Look. Atlantis underwater.
DOCTOR: A very large mass to lift.
ZAROFF: If I can't lift it then I must lower the water level. You see the valve there?
DOCTOR: Yes, may I?
ZAROFF: Please.
ZAROFF: Simple, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, but you haven't got a drain big enough to take an ocean.
ZAROFF: Then I will make one.
DOCTOR: You'll forgive me. I'm a little lost. The crust of the Earth is more than a hundred miles thick. Below that is believed to be a white-hot molten core. Now where is your ocean going to go?
ZAROFF: That is my secret.
DOCTOR: Oh, now you're making fun of me, Professor.
ZAROFF: No, no.
DOCTOR: Even supposing you could drill to the depth of a hundred miles.
ZAROFF: There is a place where a fissure reduces the distance to less than fifteen miles.
DOCTOR: It's still an enormous obstacle.
ZAROFF: But not insurmountable. We have been working on it for many years.
DOCTOR: Even if.
ZAROFF: Excuse me, I have been interrupted.
DOCTOR: But Professor?
ZAROFF: Yes?
DOCTOR: Even supposing you succeeded, you know what will happen, don't you?
ZAROFF: You tell me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, the water will be converted into superheated steam, the pressure will grow, and crack the crust of the Earth. Destroy all life, maybe even blow the planet apart.
ZAROFF: Yes. And I shall have redeemed my promise to lift Atlantis from the sea. Lift it to the sky! It will be magnificent.
DOCTOR: Yes.
ZAROFF: Bang! Bang! Bang, bang! That's all.
DOCTOR: Yes. Just one small question. Why do you want to blow up the world?
ZAROFF: Why? You, a scientist, ask me why? The achievement, my dear Doctor. The destruction of the world. The scientists' dream of supreme power!
FOREMAN: Only four loads today? You'll have to increase output or you'll be joining our fish friends. All right, get on with it.
FOREMAN: I've another two for you. All right, this way, follow me.
  
FOREMAN: What's this?
SEAN: Huh?
FOREMAN: Slacking?
SEAN:  Oh, I'm sorry I can't hear a word you're saying. Splitting with the noise.
FOREMAN: What have you got there?
JACKO: Who, me?
FOREMAN: Guard!
FOREMAN: Search that man.
GUARD: Nothing here.
FOREMAN: Search the other.
GUARD: Nothing on this one either.
FOREMAN: All right, this time you're lucky. These two have just joined us. Teach them to be useful.
JACKO: That was close. What is it?
BEN: What's the secret about a compass?
SEAN: It's as important as eyes down here. Thanks, chum. If they had found that on us we'd have been for the high jump, I tell you.
JAMIE: Why d'ye pass it on to me though? Suppose they'd caught me with it?
SEAN: Well, they didn't, did they?
BEN: Are you planning something, then?
SEAN: That's our business.
JAMIE: What's the matter with you? Are we not all in the same boat?
JACKO: That's right, Jock, and we don't want no one to rock it.
JAMIE: The name happens to be Jamie and I'll just thank you to
SEAN: Take no notice, he's a bit like that, you see.
BEN: Hey, watch it. That guard's looking this way.
SEAN: Oh, well, make out we're working.
ZAROFF: Your calculations cannot be correct. Let me see.
DAMON: Professor?
ZAROFF: Not now, Damon. Come with me.
DOCTOR: Ah, Mister Damon, you're back. Did your operation go well?
DAMON: The girl escaped.
DOCTOR: Oh dear. How very frustrating for you.
DAMON: We'll get her back.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes of course you will.
DOCTOR: It's very important to you, isn't it? I mean, you want all the human labour you can get, don't you?
DAMON: Yes. But it's cheap and plentiful. We pick up survivors from shipwrecks who would otherwise be corpses, and convert them to fish people.
DOCTOR: Amazing. The Professor leads the field in scientific discoveries. What a fantastic conception. To control the world from a test tube.
DAMON: That's right.
DOCTOR: Well, two can play at that game. Have you ever seen this?
DAMON: Stop him, stop him. Don't let him get away.
ARA: You understand, you must hide on Amdo and wait until I can fetch you. Don't be worried.
POLLY: Yes, but.
ARA: And don't make a sound.
POLLY: No, all right.
BEN: Don't you ever get sick of this seafood?
JACKO: You learn to live with it.
SEAN: Just watch it though, they haven't found any way of keeping it fresh. In a few hours it's putrid.
JAMIE: Tell me, why do you need a compass?
SEAN: Oh, there's no point in making a break without one, is there?
JACKO: Why don't you shout it out to the guard?
BEN: Look, mate, do yourself a favour and stop treating us as if we're one of them. Look, Jamie and I don't intend to stop here either.
SEAN: See, I told you. Now come on boys, will you cheer up?
JACKO: All right, all right.
BEN: How do you intend going about it?
JAMIE: Aye, how? There're guards all over.
BEN: Well, come on, give.
SEAN: Right. Well, while I was mining a shaft, I came along the entrance to a little underground tunnel like this, you see?
BEN: I see.
JAMIE: Where does it lead, though?
SEAN: Well, we haven't been able to explore it. We'll just have to take a chance. Now if we go, there'll be no turning back. You understand?
JACKO: We make it or we don't.
SEAN: Are you with us, then?
BEN: Yeah, count me in.
JAMIE: Aye, when do we go?
JACKO: When the chance comes.
SEAN: And we jump fast, do y'hear me?
FOREMAN: They need extra labour up at the project. You two join the lineup for selection.
BEN: Now's our chance. We're off.
SEAN: By Christopher, you're right. If we disappear now they'll think we're gone to the project work gang. Okay, Jacko?
JACKO: Oh, it'll give us a start anyway.
BEN: Right, now look, you go first, Jacko. That'll show Jamie and me where the entrance is. Then you go, Sean.
JAMIE: And then you, then me.
SEAN: Scatter.
FOREMAN: Right. You, you, you.
JAMIE: How about me, sir?
FOREMAN: You're too new. Get out of my way.
FOREMAN: You, you.
BEN: I volunteer, sir.
FOREMAN: Too new.
BEN: Oh, but sir.
FOREMAN: Go and join your friend.
FOREMAN: You.
FOREMAN: I thought I told you to get out of my way.
JAMIE: Oh aye, sir, I'm just going, sir.  Thanks, boys.
BEN: Come on, man. We haven't got all day.
JACKO: Took a long time, didn't he.
BEN: Yeah.
SEAN: Is that you?
JAMIE: Aye.
BEN: Well come on, hurry up.
SEAN: And bring the light.
JAMIE: All right.
BEN: Look, suppose this don't lead any place, and we want to come back?
SEAN: Oh, you won't mate. They'll kill runaway workers on sight.
GUARD: We'd better try the small chamber.
GUARD: Nothing here. The compression chamber next.
GUARD: Seen any strangers, girl?
ARA: No, sir, nobody.
DOCTOR: Ara? No, wait, Ara. It's me.
ARA: Oh, it's you.
DOCTOR: Where's Polly?
ARA: Safe. I'm taking her some food and clothes.
DOCTOR: Good girl, well done. Ara, where can I find your Chief of State?
ARA: In the council chamber, why?
DOCTOR: I want to talk to him. Can you take me to him?
ARA: Yes, but he'll hand you over.
DOCTOR: I'll have to take that risk.
DAMON : Stay outside.
DAMON: Keep your eyes skinned for escaped prisoners.
RAMO: Well, where are the others now?
DAMON: The two young men are at the mine. The girl is still at large, and so is the Doctor. But we'll find them. They cannot get away.
RAMO: Now what does Zaroff think about it all?
DAMON: Oh, he's furious, of course. Could upset his plans.
RAMO: He should not have interfered with the temple sacrifice.
DAMON: You've always hated him, Ramo. Why?
RAMO: He's a destroyer. He appeals to all that is base in our people. He should never have come to Atlantis.
DAMON: But without him, Atlantis will never rise again from the sea.
DOCTOR:  Can you get Damon away? I want to talk to the priest alone.
ARA: I'll try.
ARA: If you please?
RAMO: But not to the same extent.
ARA: Master?
DAMON: Yes, yes?
ARA: I believe I have seen the girl you are looking for.
DAMON: Where?
ARA: Down by the market.
DAMON: Show me.
DOCTOR: Can I have a word with you, Ramo?
RAMO: Doctor! Damon!
DOCTOR: We're both on the same side, Ramo. You distrust Zaroff out of instinct. I distrust him because I know the truth.
RAMO: Why should I trust you?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. I wish I could think of a good answer.
RAMO: All right, tell me what you know.
DOCTOR: Can we talk here?
RAMO: I know a place where we shan't be interrupted.
JACKO: Yeah, which way now?
BEN: This-away, or thataway?
SEAN: Oh, one is as good as the other.
JAMIE: Well, let's try fifty paces up each tunnel, then turn back.
BEN: Yeah.
JAMIE: Jacko? Oh, I suppose I'll go with you. We'll take the high road.
JACKO: Oh, let's go then.
BEN: Which leaves us with
BEN + SEAN: The low road.
 
RAMO: Come this way. We shall not be interrupted here. Now, tell me what you found out about Zaroff.
DOCTOR: He says that he's going to raise Atlantis, yes? That's not quite true. He intends to destroy Atlantis.
RAMO: A difficult task.
DOCTOR: It's easier than raising it.
RAMO: How will he destroy us?
DOCTOR: He intends to drill a hole through the earth's crust, and drain away the ocean, yes?
RAMO: Yes.
DOCTOR: Have you any idea what will happen if he does that? I'll show you.
DOCTOR: May I?
DOCTOR: This pot is the earth. This is the ocean. The ocean drains into the earth. Now, but the centre of the earth is hot, far hotter than this fire. So what happens?
RAMO: But this is child's play. What has this to do with Zaroff's project?
DOCTOR: This pot is Zaroff's project. Watch. Now the pot begins to boil, but the steam can't get out, and so. I think we'd better stand a little further back. Get down!
DOCTOR: This is what will happen. Zaroff intends to raise Atlantis, but in little pieces.
RAMO: You swear this is true?
DOCTOR: Well, I thought I might mention it. Of course, if you don't mind being blown up.
RAMO: Can you stop him?
DOCTOR: Could I? I am not the ruler of Atlantis.
RAMO: If I took you to our ruler Thous, could you convince him?
DOCTOR: I might.
RAMO: Wait here.
BEN + SEAN: Thirty eight, thirty nine, forty.
BEN: Well, what beats me is why Atlantis hasn't been discovered before.
SEAN: Oh, maybe it has, but nobody got back home to tell the tale.
BEN: Oh yeah, could be. Hey.
JACKO: Hey! It's me.
SEAN: I'm sorry. You can't be too careful these days.
BEN: Yeah, but where's Jamie? He went with you.
JACKO: He's gone on, I came back to collect you and Sean.
BEN: Now what do we do. We're not even at the end of this one yet.
SEAN: I think the best thing to do is you go back to Jamie ,and I'll go on and meet you in ten minutes.
BEN: Oh yeah, but where?
SEAN: Where? At the, er, at the fork. Okay?
BEN: Right.
RAMO: Put this on, could you?
DOCTOR: Could I?
RAMO: With these robes, no one will challenge you.
DOCTOR: How do I look?
RAMO: What?
DOCTOR: Never mind.
BEN: Jamie!
JAMIE : Here.
BEN: Jamie!
JAMIE: Down here!
BEN: Okay, mate. We're with you. Are you hurt?
JAMIE: No, but watch it. The rock's slippery.
BEN: Don't worry about us. Just cling on.
SEAN: How far down is he?
BEN: About ten feet, I'd say.
SEAN: What's that in metres?
BEN: Why don't you get further along there. 
BEN: Can you reach it? Try again. Right. Now the other hand.
BEN: Oh, Jacko!
JAMIE: I think I've got a foothold now.
BEN: All right.
POLLY: Huh. You needn't think I'm afraid of you, you stupid thing.
SEAN: Come on, quietly.
BEN: Blimey, look where we are.
JAMIE: Back at the temple.
SEAN: There's somebody down there.
POLLY: Boo.
BEN: Ah, it's Polly! All right.
JAMIE: Polly!
JACKO: You know her?
BEN: Yeah, of course I do. She's one of our lot.
POLLY: What happened to you?
BEN: We found a tunnel in the mines that lead into this idol.
JAMIE: So here we are.
BEN: What's this rigout in aid of?
POLLY: They were going to turn me into a fish.
BEN: Into a fish?
POLLY: It's not funny!
SEAN: I'm Sean, this is Jacko.
JAMIE: Have you seen the Doctor?
POLLY: Not since he went off with Professor Zaroff. Why, haven't you?
BEN: No, but I'd love to know what he's up to.
DOCTOR: Ramo, this ruler of yours, is he
RAMO: His name is Thous. He believes Zaroff to be the deliverer of Atlantis.
THOUS: Good evening, Brothers of the Temple. Please be seated. What is this important business you want to tell me about?
RAMO: Most excellent Thous, this is a matter of life and death. Under no other circumstances would I have brought a stranger to you in temple garb.
THOUS: A stranger? Who are you?
DOCTOR: A man of science.
THOUS: Science? Ah, I see. One of Professor Zaroff's colleagues. Perhaps we should ask him to join us.
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, I wouldn't do that if I were you. In fact, I wanted to speak to you alone, Excellency.
THOUS: Well, speak.
DOCTOR: Excellency, the Professor is a wonderful man.
THOUS: Wonderful?
DOCTOR: A worker of miracles.
THOUS: Indeed, you speak the truth.
DOCTOR: But, have you noticed his eyes lately?
THOUS: No.
DOCTOR: When he talks of his project, have you noticed his eyes? They light up like this!
THOUS: What does this mean?
DOCTOR: The Professor is as mad as a hatter.
THOUS: Mad? Zaroff?
DOCTOR: Completely. No answer. It's sad.
THOUS: I do not understand.
RAMO: We believe Zaroff to be working toward the destruction of Atlantis, not it's resurrection.
THOUS: I have heard such words from you before, Ramo.
RAMO: This man has proved it to me. Zaroff's plan will split the world in two. This is not the action of a sane man.
THOUS: But your own priests proclaimed him to be the prophet who would raise us above the sea.
RAMO: Lolem. He is old and superstitious.
THOUS: And your superior, Ramo. Remember that!
DOCTOR: So you will not listen to us?
THOUS: I did not say that. I have heard your arguments.
DOCTOR: We've only just begun.
THOUS: I have heard enough. Now leave me, and I will consider what you have said.
RAMO: I know you will choose well, for all our sakes.
ARA: Oh, I'm sorry I'm so long. Here's some food.
JAMIE: Ah, food.
POLLY: And clothing. Super. Thanks, Ara. Look at this! Listen, why are you doing all this for us?
ARA: You were kind to me, and I hate Zaroff.
JAMIE: You hate Zaroff?
ARA: We are not all his slaves. He will find out one day.
SEAN: Let's hope we find out soon. Do you want all that food for yourself, Ben? Come on.
BEN: Oh, sorry. Look, Ara, have you seen anything of the Doctor?
ARA: Yes, I'll take you to him later.
BEN: What's that?
ARA: Oh, quickly, you must hide. They're coming.
JAMIE: Back where we came from, Ben.
BEN: Right, the safest place in the whole of Atlantis.
SEAN: There's no need to be afraid, girl.
POLLY: Aren't you coming with us, Ara?
ARA: No, I must stay here. I'll be missed.
JAMIE: Are you two going to remain here all night? Come on.
THOUS: I have given much thought to your words, and I have come to a decision. There is your answer.
THOUS: Do with them what you will!
Episode Three
ZAROFF: So you're just a little man after all, Doctor, like all the rest. You disappoint me.
DOCTOR: You disappoint me, Professor. I didn't think a man of science needed the backing of thugs.
ZAROFF: Have a care, Doctor. Your life is in the balance.
DOCTOR: What, you mean you haven't told your own people what's in store for them? Are you afraid, Zaroff?
ZAROFF: I have made a mistake. If I had not interfered with the temple sacrifice, the sharks would have torn you apart. But it's not too late. I'll return you to Lolem and tell him I need you no longer. And he can have that stupid priest as makeweight.
DOCTOR: No. You've no quarrel with Ramo. I persuaded him to help me. I'm the one to blame.
RAMO: That is not true. I have always distrusted you, Zaroff.
ZAROFF: Take them away!
RAMO: The curse of Amdo be on you!
ZAROFF: Goodbye, Doctor. Have a pleasant journey.
DOCTOR: Let's not say goodbye, Professor. We'll be seeing each other again.
ZAROFF: Not in this world, Doctor.
ZAROFF: As always, there is nothing to worry about.
THOUS: And there is no truth in this man's arguments?
ZAROFF: The man is a fool. Have I not sworn to you that Atlantis shall rise again from the sea? Haven't I? Haven't I? What are you staring at?
THOUS: Nothing. Nothing at all.
.
DOCTOR: What happens now?
RAMO: First the supplication, and then
LOLEM: Accept, oh powerful and mighty Amdo, these your sacrifices.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry I got you into this, Ramo.
RAMO: We all have to die sometime, Doctor. If it is the will of Amdo, it is inevitable.
VOICE: This is the voice of Amdo. Hear me. Bow down your heads that Amdo may accept your sacrifice. Bow. Let no human eyes witness this awful moment.
DOCTOR:  I know that voice.
DOCTOR:  Ramo. Don't be afraid. Get up and follow me. Come on.
VOICE: He who looks on the living face of Amdo shall die.
LOLEM: A miracle! A great and powerful miracle! Amdo has eaten up her victims!
RAMO: Unbelievable. All these years and I never guessed Amdo's secret.
DOCTOR: Oh, I thought I recognised the voice. How on Earth did you manage it?
POLLY: This is linked to the back of Amdo's mouth. It's a bit old but it works.
DOCTOR: It was the sweetest sound I've ever heard in me life.
POLLY: Thanks, Doctor.
BEN: Keep your voices down now, or they'll hear us.
POLLY: No, they won't, I've put the bunghole in.
RAMO: So Amdo was made to trick her worshipers.
DOCTOR: Ben, how did you find this place?
BEN: Oh, we found it by chance. A tunnel in the mines leads straight here.
DOCTOR: Jamie!
JAMIE: Doctor. That's Sean, that's Jacko.
.
ZAROFF: So I tell you, it's complete. Everything will be ready in two days from now.
THOUS: To think that after so long the great day is at hand. We shall surprise the whole of mankind.
ZAROFF: Yes. A very great surprise. Perhaps the greatest ever.
THOUS: I shall order special prayers today.
ZAROFF: Why not? It will keep the people happy.
LOLEM : Let me in!
THOUS: What is the meaning of this, exalted Lolem?
LOLEM: A miracle, mighty Thous, before our very eyes!
ZAROFF: Tell us.
LOLEM: Mighty Amdo, goddess of land and sea, has accepted the sacrifice of the priest, and the little Doctor.
ZAROFF: Indeed. What a miracle.
LOLEM: They vanished into air before they could be beheaded.
ZAROFF: No. Disappeared, you say? How?
LOLEM: They were in our midst and we bowed our heads in prayer. When we looked again they'd gone.
ZAROFF: You lie, Priest. You allowed them to escape, no?
THOUS: You discredit the mystic power of Amdo?
ZAROFF: I believe what I see with my own eyes.
THOUS: The truth, Lolem.
RAMO: I tell you, the voice of Amdo spoke to us.
ZAROFF: Ha.
LOLEM: The little Doctor no longer lives.
THOUS: You're certain?
LOLEM: By the spirit of Amdo, by the all-beating heart of living Atlantis.
THOUS: Perhaps he is right. It is a miracle. You may go.
ZAROFF: Yes, go. And pray to Amdo that you are right.
LOLEM: May the wrath of Amdo engulf you!
ZAROFF: I'll take my chance. Get out!
THOUS: Is it wise to sow seeds of doubt by discrediting a miracle just now?
ZAROFF: Yes. If the Doctor is at large, he can be an even bigger danger. We must search the whole of Atlantis for him.
THOUS: But Lolem has said
ZAROFF: Maybe Lolem can raise Atlantis again from the sea with his prayers?
THOUS: Give your orders, Zaroff. It shall be as you wish.
ZAROFF: Now you are talking sense again.
.
POLLY: The point is, where do we go from here?
BEN: Yeah, where?
JAMIE: Aye, tell us, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Our course is plain. We must attack Zaroff. He has gone mad, and he's bent on destroying the whole world. We've only a short while in which to stop him.
SEAN: Well, just tell us what to do.
DOCTOR: Food.
SEAN: You're hungry, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
SEAN: Hungry?
DOCTOR: No, I mean Zaroff and his people cannot exist without food.
RAMO: But there's always plenty of food for everyone. The sea is all around us. The supplies are unlimited.
DOCTOR: Yes, but who provides it?
RAMO: The fish people do.
DOCTOR: The fish people! Exactly. And why? Because they are slaves. But slaves, like worms, can be made to turn.
POLLY: Right. So if you organise the fish people to cut off the supplies. Yes, but that's no good. Then they'll just go and live off their stocks.
DOCTOR: Tell them, Ramo.
RAMO: We have no stocks of food.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Zaroff has not yet found the answer to his great problem. All his seafood goes bad in a few hours, and has to be thrown away.
RAMO: That's true.
DOCTOR: And so
BEN: I get it, we get the fish people to go on strike.
JACKO: Oh, you are dreaming, man.
SEAN: Now hold on a minute, we could try right enough.
POLLY: Yes, but what would that do for us?
DOCTOR: What would it do for us? I don't know, really, but it's a start. Do you think you can do it?
SEAN: Well, we'll have a go, Doctor, but it'll take a great gift of the gab to win over the fish people, you know?
DOCTOR: But you are Irish.
SEAN: Well, come on, laughing boy. Tell me, how can we contact you?
DOCTOR: We make this place our headquarters. If nobody's here, just leave a message.
POLLY: Good luck.
JACKO: Oh, we'll need it.
BEN: What are we going to do?
DOCTOR: Kidnap Professor Zaroff!
DOCTOR: Are you all right?
POLLY: Yes, super. Look what I've got on.
DOCTOR: You look splendid.
POLLY: Better than you do. Couldn't you find a better disguise than that?
DOCTOR: What's wrong with it?
POLLY: You look like a sailor.
DOCTOR: That's what I'm supposed to be.
POLLY: No, thank you.
POLLY: Salt water.
DOCTOR: What do you expect? This is Atlantis. Now you know what to do?
POLLY: I think so.
DOCTOR: Wait a minute. Something's gone wrong. Where's Zaroff?
POLLY: Looking for us.
ARA: Back this way. Nola, we need your help.
NOLA:  Guards?
POLLY: They're looking for me.
NOLA: Lie down.
GUARD: Have you seen any strangers about, old woman?
NOLA: Everyone's a stranger these days. Why don't they stay away and leave us in peace?
GUARD: What have you got here?
NOLA: How shall I sell my carpets if you stick holes in them?
NOLA: It's clear.
ARA: Are you all right?
POLLY: Yes. Thank you very much.
NOLA: Don't waste time, girl. Get away while you're safe.
JAMIE: Zaroff's on his way, close behind us.
BEN: Hey! Did you see anyone come through the market place?
DOCTOR: A man?
BEN: Yes.
DOCTOR: About five foot nine?
BEN: That's right.
DOCTOR: Black coat, baggy trousers and a bow tie?
BEN: Exactly.
DOCTOR: No. As a matter of fact I haven't.
BEN: You fool.
JAMIE: He's gone. We'd better get in position.
BEN: Right.
DOCTOR: Polly!
ZAROFF: Where's that man who has been a moment ago?
ARA: What man, sir?
ZAROFF: Answer me, girl.
ARA: I don't know.
ZAROFF: Guard! Search over there.
GUARD: Sir!
ZAROFF: You two come with me.
DOCTOR: Zaroff!
ZAROFF: There he is! There he is! Stop that man!
DOCTOR: Zaroff!
ZAROFF: That man, which way did he go?
.
RAMO: Is all well?
DOCTOR: Splendid. He's close behind me. I hope I haven't set too hot a pace for him. No. Here he comes.
ZAROFF: He must be here somewhere. Search the temple.
BEN: Yeah.
ZAROFF: Who has entered here, priest? Ah, the renegade priest himself. Guards, take him!
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, at last.
BEN: Right, to the back with him.
ZAROFF: Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me!
POLLY: Doctor, now that you've got him, what are you going to do with him?
DOCTOR: You'll see. Come on.
JACKO: Go on, tell them.
SEAN: Tell them what? I tell them nothing. They're not people like us, they're just a bunch of sardines. You heard me. Cold-blooded fishes. You haven't got a drop of good red blood in your body.
SEAN: A flatfish from Galway would have more guts in them than that bunch.
SEAN:  You wouldn't hurt a little child.
JACKO: What would they do?
SEAN: I'll tell them. All right, all right, all right. Oh, calm down and listen. Listen, will you? Look, you supply all the food for Atlantis, right? It can't be stored, right? It goes rotten in a couple of hours. That's why Zaroff has you working like slaves night and day, right? Well, has it never occurred to your little fish brains to stop that supply of food? Feed yourselves but starve Atlantis, eh? What do you think would happen then? Well now is your chance. Will you do it, or will you stay fish slaves for the rest of your lives? You're men, aren't you? Well, start the blockade right now.
JACKO: Do you reckon they will do it?
SEAN: Who knows? We can only hope for the best.
ZAROFF: I have underrated you, Doctor. I hardly imagined you would have the nerve to kidnap Zaroff himself.
BEN: What's so funny?
JAMIE: Aye, what?
POLLY: I don't see what you've got to laugh at.
ZAROFF: Dear lady, if you wish to stop my plans, you are all too late.
RAMO: Too late?
ZAROFF: The process has started. My nuclear reactor is activated, and when the desired figure is reached, fission will take place, and none of all this will matter for any of us.
DOCTOR: He's only bluffing. Nothing can start without him.
ZAROFF: Ah, Doctor, how do you know that?
DOCTOR: Simple. The great Zaroff would have to be there to set off the explosion. Miss your big moment? I think not.
ZAROFF: You cannot hold me. My guards will
RAMO: Will never find you. Not inside the temple you have defiled, Zaroff.
ZAROFF: You are fools! Idiots! I am mightier than all of you. If I, if
POLLY: Doctor?
JAMIE: It's a ruse.
POLLY: What's the matter with him?
DOCTOR: Some sort of attack.
BEN: That stopped him. The project won't be able to go ahead now, will it?
DOCTOR: I don't know. We'd better make sure.
JAMIE: What would you do?
DOCTOR: Get inside that laboratory.
JAMIE: Then I'm coming with you.
BEN: Yeah, me too.
DOCTOR: No, somebody's got to stay here to look after Zaroff.
POLLY: I, I'll stay.
JAMIE: You can't bide here by yourself.
RAMO: I'll stay with her.
DOCTOR: Very well. Come on. Quick.
POLLY: Take care.
BEN: Yeah.
BEN: Not another service?
DOCTOR: This is likely to take some time.
JAMIE: Could we not just slip out?
DOCTOR: I don't think so. Better duck down here.
POLLY: It doesn't seem possible, does it?
RAMO: What?
POLLY: Well, look at him. He doesn't look very menacing now, does he?
RAMO: There is still evil in this man. It hangs over him like a shroud. You will pay dearly for your crimes, Zaroff.
ZAROFF: I know, I know. But before I die, priest, you must help me to pray to your god for atonement.
RAMO: Why should I help you?
ZAROFF: Have pity on me. At least help me stand at your side so I may feel the aura of your goodness.
POLLY: I think you should. He does look very ill.
RAMO: It's more than you deserve, Zaroff. But for the blessing of Amdo I will grant you this last request.
ZAROFF: And now, meddling priest, this is the end of you.
POLLY: Don't! Stop it!
ZAROFF: You will come with me.
BEN: Who'd have thought it would take that long.
JAMIE: Let's get started.
BEN: Yeah, quick.
DOCTOR: Just a minute, I've had a thought.
JAMIE: What?
DOCTOR: Jamie, you'd better watch Zaroff.
JAMIE: Why?
DOCTOR: Well, we need a guide, and only Ramo knows all the passages.
JAMIE: Oh, if you say so, Doctor.
JAMIE: Doctor, look!
RAMO: Zaroff.
DOCTOR: Come on. Come on.
BEN: Is he?
DOCTOR: Yes.
BEN: Zaroff was having us on.
JAMIE: Polly's gone.
DOCTOR: Zaroff's taken her as a hostage.
BEN: Well, let's go!
DOCTOR: No, Ben. Jamie, you go after Polly. Only watch out. Zaroff's a desperate man.
JAMIE: Right.
DOCTOR: Ben, you and I have other fish to fry. Come on.
POLLY: Oh, wait. I can't go on any more.
ZAROFF: You will go on if I have to drag you. Wait. Did you hear anything?
POLLY: No, nothing.
ZAROFF: Come on.
POLLY: No.
ZAROFF: Do you want the same treatment as the priest?
POLLY: No.
ZAROFF: Come.
JAMIE: Polly?
ZAROFF: Wait. Come back here. Come back, I warn you.
ZAROFF: Ah!
POLLY: Jamie!
ZAROFF: Go back. Go back.
JAMIE: He's away.
POLLY: Jamie, quickly, we've got to go and warn the Doctor.
JAMIE: Aye, the Doctor's going to find a heap of trouble if Zaroff gets back there first.
JACKO: How do we find the laboratory?
POLLY: Ara, she's the only one we know who knows the way. Now you go back to the temple and we'll go and find her.
DAMON: The slaves are in revolt. They've cut off all food supplies.
THOUS: I cannot understand it. Why do they act like this when the hour of triumph is at hand?
DAMON: They're just slaves, what can you expect?
THOUS: Where is Zaroff? He should be here to attend to this.
DAMON: Disappeared.
THOUS: Disappeared? He can't have. Go and look for him.
DAMON: There is no time, Excellency. You must take control now.
THOUS: So be it. I cannot let my people starve. Bring them before me that I may hear their demands.
DAMON: Yes, great Thous, I will tell them.
THOUS: All-wise, all-seeing Amdo, help me now.
THOUS: Zaroff! Where have you been? We've been looking for you. The workers are in revolt.
ZAROFF: My guards will restore order.
THOUS: They are simple people. I'm sure they will
ZAROFF: Those who resist will be killed.
THOUS: Killed?
ZAROFF: I have no time to waste.
THOUS: Zaroff, you are subject to me in all matters. I will not have my people
ZAROFF: Your people? Your people? They are my people now. I hold their whole world in my power.
THOUS: The Doctor was right about you. I order your project stopped at this moment. Guards! Take Zaroff to the temple and hold him there.
ZAROFF: You're a fool. You're a fool! I'll send you to your beloved goddess Amdo to discuss the future of the universe with her.
THOUS: I demand that you
ZAROFF: You? You demand? You demand? Well since your, since your beloved goddess has developed such an enchanting appetite for people, it is only fitting that the great Thous should offer himself. No, no, I shall offer him.
ZAROFF: Kill those two men. Nothing in the world can stop me now!
Episode Four
BEN: Doctor, look at this! Someone's been having a right punch-up in here.
DOCTOR: It's the governor. It's Thous.
BEN: Is he all right?
DOCTOR: I don't know. Doesn't seem to have hit anything vital.
BEN: Doesn't look too good, though.
DOCTOR: Neither would you with a bullet in you.
BEN: If we don't stop Zaroff soon, we'll all be for the chop.
DOCTOR: I know. Come on, we must get him to safety.
BEN: Well, then what?
DOCTOR: To the generating station.
JACKO: Are you sure the Doctor said we are to meet here?
ARA: He must come back soon.
SEAN: Well, if he's not back in five minutes we move on, okay?
JACKO: Oh, where to, if the whole world is going to blow up in a couple of hours?
SEAN: You're a great comfort to have around, did anyone ever tell you that?
ARA: Look out.
DOCTOR: Here we are. Careful. Anyone at home?
ARA: Oh, Doctor! Oh, what's wrong?
BEN: He's wounded, but don't worry, Ara, he'll be all right.
DOCTOR: Where's Polly and Jamie?
ARA: They've gone to Zaroff's laboratory.
DOCTOR: Why?
ARA: To look for you. I showed them which way to go and then they told me to come back here and wait.
DOCTOR: We'll have to find them. Now, listen everyone. I have a plan.
SEAN: Good.
DOCTOR: It might even work.
SEAN: Well?
DOCTOR: Our one hope of stopping Zaroff is to flood all this lower part of Atlantis.
BEN: But that means in here.
DOCTOR: Yes. The temple, and Zaroff's laboratory.
SEAN: Yes, but will the water stop there?
DOCTOR: Don't know. We'll have to take that chance.
JACKO: Yeah, but the people here.
DOCTOR: They'll have to be warned and moved to a higher level. That's your job and Sean's.
SEAN: And you?
DOCTOR: Ben and I will try and get into the generating station. We'll turn up the power on the reactor, break down the sea walls and flood the laboratory. There's only one thing that's worrying me.
SEAN: What's that?
DOCTOR: Can we all swim?
MAN : Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Stabiliser station Z2 calling. Routine check.
TECH: Control receiving.
MAN : Stabilisers normal. Nothing to report.
TECH: Thank you, station Z-2, report again at zero minus five.
MAN : Will do.
TECH: That's in another ten minutes.
MAN 2 : Priority, priority. Reactor station Z3 calling. Reactor station Z3 calling.
ZAROFF: Zaroff here.
MAN 2 : Reading maximum. Gauges four, five and six steady. Gauge three fluctuating and unpredictable.
ZAROFF: Bring in the reserve.
MAN 2 : The reserve? But if that fails.
ZAROFF: That is an order! Report back if the fault continues.
MAN2 : Yes, Professor.
ZAROFF: Nothing can go wrong now. Nothing must go wrong.
MAN 3 : Emergency, power network control.
ZAROFF: Zaroff here, what's the problem?
MAN 3 : Station eleven is no longer operating, the workers have deserted.
ZAROFF: Deserted? What's the matter with them? Where are they?
MAN 3 : They're out looking for food.
ZAROFF: Why?
MAN 3 : The food supplies have not arrived and there's a rumour that we're facing starvation. They've all panicked.
ZAROFF: And no reserves?
MAN 3 : That's right.
ZAROFF: Get them back at once. Send the guards after them.
MAN 3 : I've had to bring the guards into the plant to prevent a complete breakdown.
ZAROFF: Well, do the best you can. I get more men to you within the hour. Blast! Blast! Blast!
BEN: A guard! How are we going to get past him?
DOCTOR: We'll walk past him.
BEN: What, in those trousers?
DOCTOR: Oh, you think I look a bit conspicuous, do you?
BEN: A bit, yeah.
DOCTOR: Maybe you're right. I know. You're a guard, and I'm a prisoner, right?
BEN: Right!
DOCTOR: Now don't make a mess of it, there's a good chap.
GUARD: Halt!
BEN: Prisoner and escort for Professor Zaroff.
GUARD: Password?
BEN: Ay?
GUARD: Password?
BEN: Yeah, well, look it's all right for you giving me the old chat, mate, but I know nothing about passwords. I've been out chasing this burke all day.
GUARD: Professor Zaroff's not here anyway.
BEN: Well, I know that. My orders was to bring him here and wait.
GUARD: That's all very well. How do I know he's a wanted man?
BEN: Well, blimey, look at him. He ain't normal, is he?
GUARD: Yes, I see what you mean. All right.
DOCTOR: You don't know the password either!
GUARD: It's Oscar. Get him out of here!
BEN: Go on, get out! Thanks, mate.
DOCTOR: Very well done, Ben, very well done. I'm not quite sure about that not being normal bit, but very well done. I couldn't have done better myself.
BEN: Thanks.
GUARD 2: Halt. Give the password.
BEN: Oscar.
GUARD: Pass, Oscar.
DOCTOR: Come on, now. We've got little time.
BEN: What now?
DOCTOR: Cut those cables.
BEN: Do you know what you're doing?
DOCTOR: Oh, what a question. Of course I don't! There's no rule against trying, is there? There. Now, Zaroff's laboratory. He should be feeling the effects of this little lot any time now.
JAMIE: There's a gap through here.
POLLY: Oh, Jamie, I think we're lost. Are you sure this is the way Ara told us to come?
JAMIE: Aye. All the tunnels look alike, though.
POLLY: No, listen. We must be somewhere below Zaroff's power source.
JAMIE: Aye, it's like the beating of the Devil's heart.
POLLY: You're not far wrong. We'd better keep going. The laboratory can't be far away.
JAMIE: Aye, but which way?
ZAROFF: That reading must be wrong, you idiot. I'll check it myself. No, that's not possible. Come here. Look at that reading. That's all we need now, radiation leak. Where the Devil is it coming from?
JAMIE: I told you, don't look down.
POLLY: But Jamie, look. The wall down there. It's glowing.
JAMIE: What is it?
POLLY: It could be radiation.
JAMIE: Well, what's that then?
POLLY: Radiation? Well, it's. Oh, it's too difficult to explain. The walls are beginning to crumble. It's all that vibration.
JAMIE: Let's see, the sea's on the other side of that wall. Now if that gives way.
POLLY: Yes.
JAMIE: There must be way up to higher ground.
POLLY: Must get breath.
JAMIE: Lucky it's uphill. Take more time for the water to reach us.
POLLY: What's that?
JAMIE: It's given way. The sea's breaking through!
SEAN: Will you listen to that.
JACKO: What is it?
SEAN: How would I know, but it certainly isn't closing time at Betty Murphy's pub. It can be only one thing. It's the Doctor, of course. He's started to flood Atlantis. The sea's breaking in.
THOUS: To raise Atlantis from the sea was only the dream of a madman after all.
ARA: Rest. Don't speak.
JACKO: Aye, rest.
SEAN: And you best forget about all that now and look to the future. That is, if we're going to have any future.
SEAN: Well, personally speaking, not being a terribly good swimmer myself, I think I'll just start to make a move.
JACKO: Ah, we've got a visitor.
SEAN: Oh Damon, you got my warning then.
DAMON: My operating room. A life's work, washed away.
THOUS: Damon.
DAMON: Thous.
THOUS: We can start again, Damon.
SEAN: Look, if we don't hurry and get onto high ground above water level, we're going to be turned into fish food.
DAMON: Yes, you're right. Quite so. I'll help. We've got a long way to go yet.
SEAN: Come on, Jacko, up. Gently now. That's it.
.
POLLY: Oh, no! It's a dead end.
JAMIE: Aye.
POLLY: Jamie, we must go back. We've got to warn the others. There must be another turning.
JAMIE: No, I kept an eye open for one on the way up. Besides, would you listen to that water.
POLLY: We've got to get out of here somehow.
JAMIE: Do you see that? There's a draught. Right, that's what we'll follow. I'll go first, and you stay close behind me.
DAMON: Artificial respiration. Your wound?
THOUS: A little better. How is my poor country?
DAMON: The water has already flooded the lower parts of the city.
THOUS: The great enemy, which we held at bay for so many centuries, the ever-lasting nightmare is here at last.
DAMON: Rescue parties are being organised. All passages have been blocked except the main shaft. We're keeping that open till the last to give the stragglers a chance.
THOUS: What of Lolem the priest?
DAMON: Well, last seen he was going towards the temple to seek aid from Amdo.
THOUS: He is lost then.
SEAN: We may still find them. Are you all right there?
DAMON: You look after yourself.
SEAN: Oh, hey Jacko? Any luck?
JACKO: What do you expect? They must have all been drowned.
SEAN: Ah, well. Probably a better death than the one that's in store for us when Zaroff lets off his explosion.
ZAROFF: No one, I repeat, no one will leave his place. Everything goes according to schedule, except that the time of the big detonation has been advanced. The whole project will be activated from this control point. That is all until zero minus five.
ZAROFF: Now we must connect you.
DOCTOR: Good day to you. I hope I'm not too late.
ZAROFF: There is the man who has been trying to sabotage all our plans. Make sure he doesn't leave us now.
DOCTOR: Oh, how very nice of you, but I'm afraid I've interrupted something important, haven't I? Oh, yes, I can see that I have. You were on the point of exploding your firecracker, weren't you?
DOCTOR: I hope you've let these gentlemen into your big secret.
ZAROFF: They share everything with me.
DOCTOR: Naturally. They can't help themselves, can they? They must be devoted to you, to allow you to blow them all to pieces!
TECH: You what? What's he talking about, Professor?
DOCTOR: Oh, have I dropped a brick? Oh, I seem to have shaken some of them. Zaroff, I think you ought to know the sea has broken through and is about to overwhelm us here.
ZAROFF: Don't listen to him. The man lies.
DOCTOR: Then perhaps the distant roaring that we can hear is just the goddess Amdo with the indigestion?
TECH: He's right. Come on!
ZAROFF: Don't be alarmed. Don't be fooled. Ah, they're cowards, traitors. But it doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Time is running out, Zaroff. Hadn't you better call it a day?
ZAROFF: You cannot beat me, Doctor.
ZAROFF: You see, I have anticipated every situation. There was always a possibility that someone would try to keep me from my ultimate moment of triumph. Now no one can get through this, and all the controls are on this side. Now all I must do is press the plunger when the needle of that dial is over the thousand mark. Simple, no? I tell you, so that you may share the last, great experiment of Zaroff!
BEN: He's off his rocker.
DOCTOR: I know. I've got to get him out of there. Come over here. I've got an idea.
ZAROFF: Don't go away, Doctor. You will die just the same. You might as well stay and watch me.
.
JAMIE: Hold the candle. Oh, would you be careful?
POLLY: Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.
JAMIE: Right.
POLLY: Any luck?
JAMIE: Aye, there's a wee hole down there. I can't see where it leads to though. But if you're willing to take a chance?
POLLY: Do we have a choice?
POLLY: Only just in time.
JAMIE: Aye, we're not out of the woods yet.
BEN: Doctor, I've got to go. The water's nearly here.
ZAROFF: I see you have your deserters, too, Doctor. That leaves just you and me.
DOCTOR: All right, Ben.
BEN: Goodbye.
ZAROFF: Young fool. I will press the plunger long before the water gets here. The result will be the same.
DOCTOR: I know. But it's much more exciting in the dark.
ZAROFF: Doctor, you are a comedian.
ZAROFF: You see. Keep very still, Doctor. We have an emergency system here. You have solved nothing. Now unfortunately I have to tie you up. Turn around.
ZAROFF: No! No! You cannot do this to me!
ZAROFF: No! No! No!
BEN: Doctor, hurry. Now what's the matter?
DOCTOR: Ben, I've been thinking. I can't leave Zaroff to drown down there. I'm going back for him.
BEN: But why on Earth? We've got to get out of here quick or we'll be cut off!
DOCTOR: But we can't leave him there.
BEN: Look, you're coming with me.
POLLY: Oh, it's no use, Jamie, I'll never make it.
JAMIE: Course you can. One wee slope and we're away.
POLLY: And another and another and another. It's no use, I won't, Jamie.
JAMIE: Come on.
POLLY: No, no, I can't, Jamie, I can't. I can't. I can't.
JAMIE: Polly! Polly! Come on. I'll help you.
DOCTOR: Zaroff. He's cut off.
BEN: Zaroff? Who cares about him? That means the others must be, too. Well, are they?
DOCTOR: Well, how do I know? All we can do is to go on going up. Come on.
DOCTOR: Nearly there. Of course, if you will lie down and sleep.
BEN: Who said anything about lying down?
JAMIE: Come on. Come on. Fresh air.
POLLY: Oh, we made it. Ben and the Doctor?
JAMIE: I'm thinking he wouldn't have stood much of a chance back there. They may have.
DAMON: Any sign of the Doctor?
ARA: No. He must have died saving us.
THOUS: We'll raise a stone to him in the temple.
DAMON: No. No more temples. It was temples and priests and superstition that made us follow Zaroff in the first place. When the water's found it's own level, the temple will be buried forever. We shall never return to it. But we will have enough left to build a new Atlantis, without gods and without fish people.
THOUS: Yes. That shall be his memorial.
BEN: Doctor, what about Polly?
POLLY: I can't see anyone.
JAMIE: Whist.
DOCTOR: Boo!
JAMIE: You!
DOCTOR: Me?
JAMIE: We thought you were dead.
DOCTOR: Us? Polly, good to see you. Come on, you two.
SEAN: Oh, no. I can't believe it.
JACKO: What?
SEAN: A flaming English police box.
DOCTOR: Right. Off we go into the wide blue yonder, as someone was once heard to remark.
POLLY: Hooray.
BEN: Yeah, I'm not sorry to be out of that place. Phwoar, Jamie, you don't half stink of fish!
JAMIE: Oh, you want to take a wee sniff of yourself, Benjamin. He's not exactly a bonnie bunch of heather.
DOCTOR: You sound very happy, Jamie.
JAMIE: Oh aye, Doctor, I am now. You know I never thought I'd say this, but, well it's great.
POLLY: What is?
JAMIE: All this. I'll never know what makes it go, mind you, but, well, at least I feel safe in here. It's only the wee things outside that are, well, alarming.
DOCTOR: He's got a point there.
BEN: Yeah, you can say that again.
JAMIE: Is it a fact, though, Doctor? You can't exactly control the Tardis?
DOCTOR: Control it? Of course I can control it.
JAMIE: No, no, what I meant was, can you not exactly make it go where you mean it to?
DOCTOR: If I wanted to. It's just that I've never wanted to.
BEN: Oh, yeah, I bet.
DOCTOR: Right, just for that, I'll show you. Now, where shall we go? I know, let's go to Mars.
POLLY: Doctor, what's happening?
BEN: Doctor, can't you do something?
DOCTOR: Do something? I seem to have done something. It's all your fault, wanting me to tamper with the steering. I'm very sorry, everybody, but I'm afraid the Tardis is out of control!
