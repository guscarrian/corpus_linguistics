The Savages
Episode One
DOCTOR: Yes, I think I can say that I know just exactly where we are.
DODO: Past, present or future?
DOCTOR: In the future. Very much in the future. We've now reached the distant horizon of an age, an age of peace and prosperity. Now, I'm going to be off.
STEVEN: He said five minutes.
DODO: The Doctor has no idea of time. For someone who's travelled about in time as much as he has, that's rather funny.
STEVEN: This is nothing to laugh at, Dodo.
DODO: Oh, don't take it so seriously. If you're so worried about him, you shouldn't have let him go.
STEVEN: All right. You try telling the Doctor what to do.
DODO: Then you should have gone with him.
STEVEN: You heard what he said.
DODO: You don't have to do everything he tells you. You're a grown man. Or are you?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's just as I thought. Yes. Yes, well I think my young friends are in for quite a surprise.
STEVEN : Doctor! Doctor?
DOCTOR: Oh, dear me, what was that now? Well, I shan't be long anyway.
STEVEN : Doctor? Doctor!
STEVEN : He doesn't answer yet, Dodo. I think I'd better go and look for him.
DODO: All right.
STEVEN : I won't go far.
STEVEN: Dodo! What's happened?
DODO: Up there.
STEVEN: There's nothing there.
DODO: I saw a man in animal skins and with an axe.
STEVEN: You sure? Well, the Doctor said
DODO: I don't care what he said. I saw him. He was like a savage from the Stone Age.
STEVEN: Then the Doctor was wrong. We're not in the future at all. We must be back at the beginning of man.
DOCTOR: That ridiculous young man. He thought I'd made a mistake.
TOR: He is coming. What's he carrying?
CHAL: It is not a light gun.
TOR: He is one of the leaders?
CHAL: He is not one of our people.
TOR: He is coming near. We must run.
CHAL: Stay. We kill this man.
DOCTOR: Hello, there. I say, come out from underneath there. Now don't be alarmed. Come along now.
TOR: Look.
DOCTOR: Oh, good gracious me. You know, I thought for one moment you were hiding behind those bushes.
EDAL: We have come to welcome you.
EXORSE: It is a great honour to have you visit our planet.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, I see. Well, I am expected. Do you know who I am?
EDAL: Not your name, of course, but our space observers have their own name for you.
DOCTOR: Oh, and what might that be?
EXORSE: You are known to us as the Traveller from Beyond Time.
DOCTOR: I see. And how would you expect me here and now?
EXORSE: The Elders of our city have been plotting the course of your space-time ship for many light years. They estimated your arrival some time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. Yes, well, that's very clever of them.
EDAL: What is this? We understood from our Elders that you did not carry weapons.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, they're quite right, yes, I never do. No, this is my RV, you see. This is my Reacting Vibrator. I'm able to do my calculations from this. As I told my young friends
EDAL: You are not alone?
DOCTOR: Good gracious, no. Did you expect me to be?
EDAL: We have no information about your companions.
DOCTOR: Oh, they're very pleasant. Yes, they're both very pleasant apart from their juvenile exuberances. I'm sure you'll like them. They must be at the back here somewhere. I think they're rather worried because I'm a bit late joining them.
EDAL: We had no instructions about them. The Elders must be informed. You must come with us.
DOCTOR: Must?
EXORSE: Captain Edal wishes to take you to the Elders of our City. They are waiting to welcome you.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, of course, yes, yes, yes, I shall come with you. In the meantime, young man, I wonder if you'd mind trying to find my young people for me. Steven and Dodo. Tell them the Doctor sent you.
EDAL: Go for them, Exorse. Bring them to the city. This way.
STEVEN: I'll have to go and look for him, Dodo. Something must have happened to him.
DODO: I'll come with you.
DODO: Steven!
STEVEN: What is it?
DODO: There is something up there.
STEVEN: Look, you're imagining things. Come on.
DODO: Told you.
STEVEN: A spear. It's sharp as a knife. You were right, Dodo. There is someone up there.
DODO: What are we do now?
STEVEN: Back to the Tardis, quick.
DODO: They're getting nearer!
EXORSE: Welcome to the Traveller's companions. You are Dodo and Steven?
STEVEN: How do you know? Who are you?
EXORSE: The Traveller told me I would find you here.
STEVEN: The Traveller? You mean the Doctor? Is he all right?
EXORSE: Perfectly. He has gone to meet the Elders of our City.
DODO: But the savages?
EXORSE: I think you will find that some of us are fairly civilised.
DODO: Then this isn't the Iron Age?
EXORSE: By no means.
STEVEN: The Doctor was right.
EXORSE: Please, come with me to the City. Our Elders wait to honour your Doctor. They will be very happy also to welcome his friends.
JANO: You are welcome, welcome indeed. Though we know you only as a record in our charts of space and time, yet you seem to us like an old friend.
DOCTOR: Well, that's very kind of you to make me feel so welcome.
JANO: We are honoured by your visit. The whole city looks upon you with admiration. Let me introduce myself. I am Jano, leader of the council of Elders. These are my councillors. We have all known about you for a long time. Look, we have charted your voyages from galaxy to galaxy and from age to age, but we never thought that we would meet you face to face. This is a great moment in our history. To mark our admiration, we would be pleased if you would accept the office of one of our high Elders.
DOCTOR: Well, my dear sir, that's very good of you. Yes, yes, very good of you indeed. Yes, I don't remember being so highly honoured before like this anywhere I've been.
JANO: We recognise in you the greatest specialist in time-space exploration. You have taken this branch of learning far beyond our elementary calculations.
DOCTOR: Oh, come, come, my dear sir. I know that you've been very responsible for vast scientific research. And at the same time, I always knew a race existed of great intelligence in this segment of the universe.
JANO: Thank you, Doctor. We like to think that we have created here something of lasting value.
DOCTOR: You have, you have. Indeed, you have. And if I may so say, thank you dear ladies for making me appear so grand.
EXORSE: The Doctor's two friends, sir. Steven and Dodo.
JANO: You are very welcome.
DOCTOR: Ah, there you are, both of you. Well, I don't think I was so far wrong, my boy. What do I look like, my dear?
DODO: You're really with it now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes. With what, my dear?
STEVEN: What is this place?
JANO: Did the Doctor not tell you?
DODO: Not exactly.
STEVEN: He said it was an age of peace and prosperity.
DOCTOR: Yes, and I was right. They are very highly developed civilised minds.
JANO: But our calculations were incomplete. We did not realise that the Doctor would have anyone with him. Nevertheless, although our honours are for him, our gifts are for you.
DODO: Oh, thank you. It's beautiful.
STEVEN: Look at that, Doctor.
DODO: Steven, these are real diamonds.
JANO: Perhaps Steven and Dodo would like to make themselves at home.
DOCTOR: Oh yes, thank you.
JANO: Our young people will show them round.
DOCTOR: An excellent idea, sir. Well, my boy, now perhaps you'll believe me next time I tell you I know precisely where I am.
JANO: Now, Doctor, we have many questions to ask you.
EDAL: We're only the city guard, of course. They don't ask our opinion, do they?
EXORSE: What's the matter, Captain?
EDAL: I don't trust them. I never did trust strangers. Why should we treat this old Doctor as one of ourselves?
EXORSE: The Elders think highly of him.
EDAL: The Elders. All right, we've wasted enough time this morning. Get back on patrol. Take the Crater section.
CHAL: They have begun hunting.
TOR: We must warn our people.
CHAL: Nanina, go back to the caves. Tell the families to hide.
NANINA: But what of you, Chal?
CHAL: We will be safe, we will warn the others. Nanina, take care in the craters.
 and a girl called Flower.)
FLOWER: We have built into the city a life-giving sun of our own. Isn't that right, Avon?
AVON: It is man's intellect which decides the heat and cold in our city.
FLOWER: Yes. After all, the Elders do know what's best for us, although it would be rather nice to know what real things are like sometimes.
AVON: Real what?
FLOWER: You know. Real wind, real rain, real sunshine.
AVON: Don't be ridiculous. They have given us all this.
DODO: It's beautiful.
AVON: Our artists have every opportunity to develop their talents. Here, everyone has a chance to do what is best for him to do.
STEVEN: It's certainly a wonderful job. But how have you managed it? What's the secret?
FLOWER: Secret? What makes you think we have a secret?
STEVEN: Other civilisations have failed to make this advance.
FLOWER: Well, that doesn't mean
AVON: Be quiet, Flower. Our scientists have made one simple discovery, and due to this they have found the way to give us all greater energy, greater intellect and greater talents.
STEVEN: One simple discovery?
DODO: What was it?
AVON: This is something best discussed by the Elders and your Doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, gentlemen, I can't just sit here in all these grand clothes without asking a few questions. After all, there's my reputation to think about.
JANO: What do you mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, if I accept your gifts, I must endorse your life. But I can't do that without knowing something about you.
JANO: But surely you know a great deal about us.
DOCTOR: Yes, I know very well that you are far advanced than most planets. But how you achieve this, I know not. And let's face it gentlemen, you are much advanced. Now, I would like to know how.
TOR: I cannot see her. She must have got away.
CHAL: She has not crossed the ravine yet. She is still hiding.
TOR: Can you see the hunter?
CHAL: He is going into the ravine.
CHAL: He is over there. And Nanina?
TOR: She is there too.
CHAL: Nanina!
CHAL: Nanina! Not that way!
TOR: He has taken her.
JANO: Life preys on other forms of life, as you know, Doctor. Wild beasts live on other animals. Mankind must have food, water, and oxygen.
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, it's quite obvious to the meanest intellect that, well, how can I say, that you've found a much more effective source of energy.
JANO: That is true, Doctor. We have learned how to transfer the energy of life directly to ourselves. We can tap it at its source. It is as though we were able to recharge ourselves with life's vital force.
CHAL: Nanina. Leave her. Leave the girl. Take me in her place!
JANO: The energy of life which we accumulate we store in vats such as these. Then, when the Elders decide that some member of the community needs new force, we can transfer that energy directly.
DOCTOR: To a member of your community.
JANO: Exactly. We can give ourselves new power.
DOCTOR: Yes. Of course, you need a very high form of life to make this source effective.
JANO: That is true, Doctor. We absorb only a very special form of animal vitality.
FLOWER: Don't think we're always serious. We play games, we dance, we go hunting. Our life's very happy. We do everything we want, go everywhere we want.
AVON: Do not go that way.
DODO: I thought you said we could go anywhere.
AVON: Well, it leads to the world beyond the City.
DODO: Don't you ever go outside?
FLOWER: We're not allowed to.
AVON: There is no need.
FLOWER: Yes, that's right. Everything we want, we have here in the City.
STEVEN: What about the men we met outside?
FLOWER: They're the guards.
DODO: What, to keep back the savages?
AVON: The savages?
DODO: The men in animal skins.
AVON: You saw them?
DODO: They threw spears at us.
AVON: Yes, well, the guards are to keep these people away. That is why we seldom go beyond the City.
FLOWER: Let's forget such a dismal topic. Come, I'll show you the stadium. There's going to be a celebration there tonight especially for you.
AVON: Dodo!
DODO: I'm coming. Every time I want to see something, they stop me.
STEVEN: Dodo, you're a guest here. Try to behave like one.
DODO: I hate conducted tours.
STEVEN: What were you goggling at anyway?
DODO: I saw one of the guards go past. He had a prisoner.
STEVEN: You must be off your head! You wouldn't have a prisoner in a place like this.
DODO: He had one of the savages with him. A girl. She seemed to be moving along in a light that shone from one of those guns they carry.
STEVEN: Oh Dodo, really.
DODO: Oh no, it's true. It was like a torch. As he moved, she went ahead.
FLOWER: Come along, we're just wondering which way to take you now.
DODO: Why are they so cautious about what they show us?
STEVEN: You imagine things.
FLOWER: What are you whispering about?
STEVEN: We're just coming.
DODO: We're not going to find out much about this place from these two, are we?
STEVEN: Come on!
NANINA: Please, please let me go.
SENTA: That must be Exorse. He's already behind his deadline. What's happening to security this morning?
SENTA: He seems very depleted. What's his vitality reading? Seventeen point four. They took that very low. Can't they follow instructions in there, or have I got to supervise every transfer of energy myself. Now, let's see. His recuperative charge is high. He'll recover. Those confounded guards, they're all the same. They keep you waiting, throw the whole routine out of gear, and then they expect you to be ready for them the moment they arrive. All right, take him away. Release him. Help him along corridor KO4, emergency exit. Go ahead.
SENTA: Prepare this one. A47. We're behind schedule. We must transfer immediately. I am filing a complaint, Exorse. You're late. Surely she didn't give you much trouble?
EXORSE: Of course not. I was delayed by the strangers.
SENTA: You've seen them?
EXORSE: Captain Edal and I were the first to find them. We brought them back. That was why I was late.
SENTA: You've actually seen them. What are they like?
EXORSE: Very like us, in some ways.
SENTA: But in some ways, they're different?
EXORSE: Yes, but I can't quite say what it is. I must be going.
SENTA: Is A47 ready yet? Yes, that seems all right. Tell them to be quite sure not to take A47 below vitality reading 24.
SENTA: Is he all right? Let's see.
STEVEN: This city really is fantastic. You've fountains, music, everything.
AVON: Yes, we're very proud of it.
STEVEN: Why is it only within the confines of the City itself that you have such ideal conditions? What about beyond?
FLOWER: Well
AVON: We've told you before. We have everything here that we need.
NANINA: Please, please.
SENTA: All right. Take her away.
NANINA: Oh no! No! No please!
JANO: Doctor, do you realise that with our knowledge, we can make the brave man braver, the wise man wiser, the strong man stronger. We can make the beautiful girl more beautiful still. You will see the advantages of that in the perfection of our race.
FLOWER: Come and see this, Dodo.
STEVEN: Yes, come on, Dodo, I'm sure you'll find. Oh, no. Now where's she gone? What's happened?
FLOWER: Dodo?
STEVEN: Dodo? Dodo, where are you?
NANINA: Please, no, don't, please, don't, no, no
SENTA: Make the connection.
SENTA: Vapourisation?
TECH 1: Vapourisation on.
TECH 2: Vapourisation on.
TECH 3: Vapourisation on.
SENTA: Prepare for transfer.
TECH 1: Standing by.
TECH 1: Twenty three point zero
TECH 2: Thirty eight
TECH 1: Twenty four point zero nine
TECH 2: One hundred.
TECH 2: One point zero two.
STEVEN: Dodo! Dodo, where are you? What could have happened to her?
AVON: I cannot think. Perhaps she's playing a joke.
STEVEN: What do you mean?
FLOWER: She may be hiding. Just a game.
STEVEN: Not even Dodo'd be as stupid as that. Something must have happened to her. Dodo! Dodo!
JANO: So you see Doctor, with this new stimulus, intellectual workers find themselves able to accomplish more. Artists are able to create works of brilliance and beauty. Everything citizen
STEVEN : Doctor! Doctor!
DOCTOR: My dear Steven, you must not come bursting into the room like this. Well?
STEVEN: Well it's Dodo. She's gone.
DOCTOR: Gone? What do you mean, gone?
STEVEN: She's completely vanished.
JANO: What are we to understand by this, Avon?
AVON: It's true.
FLOWER: Dodo was with us, and she vanished into thin air.
DOCTOR: Well, I really don't know what all this fuss is about. I'm sure the child won't come to any harm while she here.
JANO: No. She cannot leave the city.
DOCTOR: If I know that young lady, she's well enough to look after herself. Now, come along, please let's finish the conversation.
STEVEN: But Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tut, tut, tut.
SENTA: Subject is very weak. Prepare to switch. I'll give you the signal.
SENTA: Vitality reading?
TECH 1: Twenty six.
SENTA: Carefully now.
TECH 2: In the control room with her. Quick.
DODO: What do you think you're doing. Leave me alone!
TECH 3: Who is she?
TECH 2: She must be from outside. I'll check the list.
TECH 3: Why is she wearing such strange clothes?
DODO: You keep your hands to yourself.
TECH 2: We have no record of her. The only female in here is the one who is in there now.
TECH 3: She must be from outside. Is she for transference?
TECH 2: She must be. What else? We'd better make preparations.
DODO: No, no, no!
AVON: We came along here, you see, then we stopped and looked out of this window.
FLOWER: The window?
EDAL: It's too small. She couldn't get out of that. You should have watched her. You'll be held responsible.
FLOWER: We thought she was following. We didn't know she could vanish.
EDAL: She passed here?
AVON: Yes, but she couldn't go through it.
EDAL: Why not?
STEVEN: Hey, what is this?
FLOWER: Oh, it's nothing. We never use it. Pay no attention.
EDAL: The guards use it.
FLOWER: Oh, we never go there. None of the young people do. Dodo would never go down there.
STEVEN: You don't know her. She'd go anywhere.
EDAL: If she's gone down there, I wouldn't give much for her chances.
STEVEN: What do you mean?
EDAL: I wouldn't give much for yours either.
FLOWER: She wouldn't go that way. It's not allowed.
STEVEN: Well, if it isn't allowed, Dodo would be the first in the queue. I'm going to take a look.
EDAL: Stay where you are!
TECH 2: Something very strange has happened, Senta. We have one of the outsiders, but she does not submit. She is fighting.
SENTA: What?
TECH 2: In the control room.
SENTA: Take over.
DODO: I don't know what you do in here, but whatever it is, I don't like it! Oh, no you don't! I don't know who on Earth you think I am, but you'd better keep back. This equipment must cost a packet. Keep back, or I'll smash the lot!
SENTA: Don't move! She could kill everyone.
EDAL: You're not allowed in there.
STEVEN: It's the only place she can be.
EDAL: I will go and see.
TECH 1: Senta! Senta!
SENTA: Who are you?
DODO: I'm with the Doctor. We are guests here. If this is how you treat your guests.
SENTA: You are one of the people from beyond time?
TECH 2: How is it possible?
DODO: Yes, I am.
SENTA: But why are you here? TECH 1 : Senta!
SENTA: Stay here.
TECH 1: It is almost too late.
SENTA: Break the connection!
EDAL: What are you doing here?
DODO: I just came through that door up there.
SENTA: I shall report the whole matter. Who is in charge of the party?
EDAL: What has she seen?
SENTA: It's hard to say.
EDAL: The Elders have already been told.
SENTA: Well, get her out of here!
EDAL: I already have my orders. Come along, this way.
DODO: All these instruments, that big glass thing, and those huge bottles. What do they do here?
EDAL: Come along. Your friends are waiting for you.
SENTA: Get her out.
TECH 1: Is it too late?
SENTA: Not quite. We've been lucky. Make a record of this for her files. It must be some considerable time before we extract any more life energy from this particular subject.
STEVEN: Where the dickens did you get to?
DODO: Oh, don't you start now.
STEVEN: Why? What happened?
DODO: You have no idea. I was attacked by some sort of mad doctor.
FLOWER: Oh, Dodo. What a ridiculous story.
DODO: What goes on down there anyway? Is it a sort of hospital?
AVON: Yes, yes that's right. It's a hospital.
FLOWER: Perhaps they thought you were a patient.
DODO: I wouldn't like to be a patient in their hands.
EDAL: You must have a reason for saying that. I would like to know what it is. What did you see?
DODO: It wasn't anything I saw exactly, just a feeling about the place. It was all so sterile and inhuman.
STEVEN: Er, she imagines things.
FLOWER: I can see that. I know just the place to cheer you up, Dodo.
EDAL: You will have to report to the Elders. I will take you there. You two will undoubtedly be called to answer for your negligence.
DODO: Oh, I hope I haven't landed you in any trouble.
FLOWER: Oh, no, we'll be all right.
AVON: Of course we will be. Perhaps we'll see you both later.
STEVEN: Yes. I hope so.
EDAL: Stay here. A guard will collect you.
AVON: Must Flower be taken before the Elders? It was my fault. I should have kept a better watch on Dodo.
EDAL: You should be thinking of your own defence.
FLOWER: Oh, Avon, what will happen to us? Will they take?
AVON: Do not worry, Flower. That is only for the savages.
FLOWER: Are you sure?
AVON: I'm sure you will be all right.
FLOWER: But the guard's coming for us.
AVON: Do not be afraid. After all, this is a free state, isn't it, and we are all equal here.
FLOWER: But
AVON: They cannot harm us.
STEVEN: You all right?
DODO: I am now.
STEVEN: I told you not to go off by yourself.
DODO: Don't worry, it won't happen again.
SENTA: You are to go. You understand? You are to go. Help her to release exit number four.
DOCTOR: A very interesting discussion, gentlemen. Yes, I must say.
DOCTOR: Oh, so there you are, my dear. You know you had that young man in quite a state.
DODO: Doctor, I must speak to you. I want to tell you what happened.
DOCTOR: Not for the moment, my dear.
STEVEN: I think you ought to listen.
DOCTOR: Do you my boy? Well, I'm afraid I can't just now. I've had a very interesting discussion with these gentlemen. You know, I have some documents which I think that you might be interested to see. They're records of my investigations into time travel. You might find them rather surprising.
JANO: You intend to return to the Tardis, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, just for the moment. But I won't be long.
STEVEN: I'll come with you.
DOCTOR: Oh, splendid, my boy. Thank you. I need someone to help me carry a few things.
JANO: I'll send one of my guards with you.
DOCTOR: No, no, thank you, that won't be necessary. Thank you, indeed. Well, come along, my dear. We don't want to lose you again, do we? 
JANO: How serious is it?
EDAL: What she saw meant nothing to the girl.
JANO: But does she suspect anything?
EDAL: It's hard to say. What about the Doctor?
JANO: He is a very sophisticated man, Captain. It is impossible to know what he thinks.
EDAL: It might be wise to keep an eye on him.
JANO: It might be very wise. Follow them.
DOCTOR: Ah, now. Wait a minute, let me see, where are we?
DODO: Doctor, why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
DOCTOR: Because I didn't want those gentlemen to overhear what you were saying, child.
STEVEN: Who? Jano and the Elders?
DOCTOR: Precisely.
STEVEN: Why, don't you trust them?
DOCTOR: Not altogether.
STEVEN: What have you discovered?
DOCTOR: Nothing really, but I sense that things aren't all together right here. Now I think we go this way, isn't it? Come along.
STEVEN: Hey, wait a minute.
DOCTOR: What?
STEVEN: What's that?
DODO: It's one of the savages.
DOCTOR: Really? But he's not moving. Yes, yes, let's take a look. Hold that. Here.
DODO: Why, that's him, the man in the corridor. The one I helped. But there were two others.
DOCTOR: Was he in this condition when you met him before?
DODO: Yes.
DOCTOR: Did he come out of that laboratory?
DODO: Yes, I think so. What's that matter with him, Doctor? Do you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, I think I do, yes. It's just as I feared.
DODO: Feared?
DOCTOR: Yes, their wonderful civilisation is based on this. They've discovered a way of extracting life's force from human beings, and absorbing it into themselves, leaving the victim, as you see, almost dead.
DODO: What can we do to help him?
DOCTOR: Here's the key to the Tardis, my boy. Now I want you to go to the emergency cabinet and you will see a container with capsules marked D403. Bring it back here as soon as you can. I think we might be able to do something for the poor man.
STEVEN: Right.
DOCTOR: Meanwhile, take that, I don't want it anymore.
DOCTOR: Now, now, now, now you just rest there, there's a good fellow. We'll have you as right as rain in five minutes. Now I just want you to breathe in and out. Gently. One, two. One
EDAL: Do you require assistance, Doctor?
DOCTOR: What do you know of this?
EDAL: He's one of the savages. I shouldn't let him worry you. He's probably shamming. He should be back on the reserve. Come on, you lazy animal, get up, move! Get back to your sector.
DOCTOR: What are you doing, fellow? Leave the man alone. He'll probably die.
EDAL: I don't think there's much chance of that, Doctor. Come on, you, move.
DOCTOR: I insist that you leave him alone!
EDAL: I don't think you understand, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I think I understand only too well.
EDAL: You do? And you still waste time on this creature?
DOCTOR: This human being!
EDAL: Why the concern, Doctor? They are only savages.
DOCTOR: They are men. Human beings, like you and me. Although it appears at the moment that you're behaving in a rather sub-human fashion.
EDAL: They have not developed like we have. They are savages! Come on.
DOCTOR: I forbid you to touch him!
EDAL: You are obstructing me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I am looking after this wretched fellow.
EDAL: You will come with me.
DOCTOR: I have already told you I'm busy. I'm going to take care of this poor man.
EDAL: I have warned you! You will do as I order you!
DOCTOR: Hmm?
EDAL: Or you'll know the alternative. You will come with me back to the city.
DODO: Where were they?
STEVEN: Over there.
DODO: Where's the Doctor?
STEVEN: Doctor? Doctor!
DODO: Now what do we do?
STEVEN: Give him the capsules.
DODO: What about the Doctor?
STEVEN: Oh, you know what he's like. He'll be back. He's just roamed off somewhere.
DODO: Here, take this.
DODO: Shall I give him another one?
STEVEN: Yes, that first one seems to have done him good.
DODO: Steven, the savages! And they've got spears!
TOR: I'll aim for the man. You kill the girl.
CHAL: No, we must not kill them.
TOR: They have no light guns. They cannot harm us. It will be revenge.
CHAL: Revenge is no good! And what would the guards do to our people?
TOR: But we must save Wylda.
CHAL: Not by killing.
TOR: If we wait too long he will die.
CHAL: He will not die. They will not let him die. They take their strength from the living. We must wait and be patient. It might be a trap. Come on.
DODO: We must get away.
STEVEN: To the city?
DODO: No, I don't want to go back there.
STEVEN: All right. Where to, then?
DODO: Well, couldn't we get to the Tardis?
STEVEN: Might be too late. Besides, we can't go. They might have got the Doctor.
DODO: They're coming nearer.
STEVEN: All right. Don't let them see you're afraid.
DODO: I'll try.
TOR: Kill them!
CHAL: Wait!
WYLDA: Do not kill.
CHAL: Wylda speaks.
WYLDA: Do not kill them. They're friends.
CHAL: Friends? What did you give him?
STEVEN: We gave him medicine.
CHAL: Why?
STEVEN: Because he's sick.
CHAL: We left him to recover. He is not sick.
STEVEN: But look at him!
CHAL: You think he is sick?
STEVEN: Yes!
CHAL: You are from the city?
DODO: No, we're not.
CHAL: You must come from the city.
STEVEN: No, we come from another place.
TOR: We have seen you. You were in the city.
STEVEN: We were taken there.
CHAL: You have friends in the city?
WYLDA: She helped me, and the old man spoke against it.
STEVEN: The Doctor? Where is he?
WYLDA: They have taken him.
STEVEN: Taken him!
DODO: Where to?
WYLDA: To the city.
DODO: They've taken him prisoner? Steven, what are we going to do?
STEVEN: Who took him?
WYLDA: The guard.
STEVEN: One of the guards? Why would they want to do a thing like that?
WYLDA: The old man was angry. He tried to protect me from their captain.
JANO: We do not understand you, Doctor. You who have accepted our honours gladly, how can you condemn this great artistic and scientific civilisation because of a few wretched barbarians?
DOCTOR: So your rewards are only for the people that agree with you?
JANO: No. No, of course not. But if you are going to oppose us.
DOCTOR: Oppose you? Indeed I am going to oppose you, just in the same way that I oppose the Daleks or any other menace to common humanity.
JANO: I am sorry you take this attitude, Doctor. It is most unscientific. You are standing in the way of human progress.
DOCTOR: Human progress, sir? How dare you call your treatment of these people progress!
JANO: They are hardly people, Doctor. They are not like us.
DOCTOR: I fail to see the difference.
JANO: Do you not realise that all progress is based on exploitation?
DOCTOR: Exploitation indeed! This, sir, is protracted murder!
JANO: We have achieved a very great deal merely by the sacrifice of a few savages.
DOCTOR: The sacrifice of even one soul is far too great! You must put an end to this inhuman practice.
JANO: You leave me no choice. Take him away, Captain. And tell Senta that we have an emergency. I shall be sending him special instructions.
STEVEN: We must do something to help.
CHAL: There is nothing we can do.
STEVEN: Look, the people in the city are just men. You can fight them.
CHAL: They are too strong.
DODO: We are not going to let them do anything to the Doctor.
CHAL: They have the light guns.
TOR: They will use the Doctor like the rest of us.
DODO: What do you mean?
CHAL: They will take him to the room where the great vats are.
STEVEN: What will happen to him there?
CHAL: He will become like us.
STEVE: We'll see about that.
CHAL: They'll do the same to you if you
EDAL: Senta, this is the Doctor, the traveller from beyond time.
DOCTOR: So this is the place where you carry out your foul experiments.
SENTA: This is my laboratory. I'm honoured to meet you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you. What's this?
SENTA: Why have you brought the Doctor down here today? I've no time for visitors. We have a very full schedule, as you're well aware, Captain Edal.
EDAL: You will suspend all other work and prepare for an emergency transference.
SENTA: But that's out of the question.
EDAL: The order comes directly from Jano.
SENTA: You are interested in our work?
DOCTOR: Oh, yes, yes, interested, yes. Although I disapprove of your activities.
SENTA: I shall be honoured to show you my laboratory when I have the time. Well, where is the savage for transference?
DOCTOR: No, gentlemen, no, gentlemen. I don't wish to bear witness.
EDAL: It's quite all right, Doctor. You will not be asked to witness this experiment.
DOCTOR: I should hope not, my boy.
EDAL: Instead you will have the pleasure of participating in it.
DOCTOR: What did you say?
SENTA: Do you realise what you're saying? We cannot transfer such a high form of life. It's never been done.
JANO: This time it will be done. It will be an interesting experiment for you.
SENTA: But, he's a fellow scientist, he's one of us.
JANO: You have your orders. See that they are carried out.
DOCTOR: I think you have forgotten one thing, gentlemen.
JANO: I don't think so, Doctor.
DOCTOR: My feelings in this matter! I will not submit to your nauseating experiments! I am going out of that door, so don't try to stop me.
EDAL: Go back, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Let me pass.
SENTA: You two, strap him to the trolley!
JANO: Report to me as soon as the transference is completed.
SENTA: Take the readings. Open a special file in the computers. We've never done a transference like this before. We'll use channel double A, double one.
TECH 1: We are ready, Senta.
SENTA: Very well. Stand by.
SENTA: All correct. Make the connection.
SENTA: High input vats?
TECH 1: High input vats in contact.
SENTA: Vapourisation.
TECH 2: Vapourisation on.
TECH 1: Vapourisation on.
SENTA: Prepare for transfer.
TECH 1: Standing by.
SENTA: Now remember. We've never done anything like this before. Watch everything very carefully. Let me know the moment there's anything unusual.
TECH 1: I will, Senta.
SENTA: Transfer on.
SENTA: Call me the readings.
TECH 1: Point zero one, point zero two, point zero three, point zero six.
SENTA: Keep it steady.
TECH 1: Point zero eight. It's impossible. He'll never stand it!
SENTA: It should be working by now.
TECH 1: Point one zero.
SENTA: Come on, come on! It must work!
TECH 1: Point three zero.
TECH 2: Vitality dropping fast.
SENTA: It's no use. We must stop the experiment.
TECH 1: No, Senta. Look, it's working!
SENTA: Energy reaction?
TECH 2: Seventeen. Constant
SENTA: It is working.
TECH 2: Seventeen rising.
TECH 3: Point seven zero.
TECH 2: Eighteen.
SENTA: Take it up a couple of points.
TECH 2: Nineteen.
SENTA: Two more.
TECH 2: Twenty.
SENTA: Wonderful! It's amazing. He must have tremendous strength.
TECH 2: Twenty one. Twenty two.
SENTA: Vapourisation is perfect. Everything is working. It's going to be a classic transference. This is our greatest success.
TECH 1: One point five zero.
TECH 2: Twenty five.
TECH 1: Two point five zero.
Episode 3
TECH 1: Five point one. Zero. Five point six. Zero. Six point one. Zero. Six point seven. Zero. Seven point one. Zero.
SENTA: Adjust resistance pressure. What's the resistance reading?
TECH 1: Negative.
SENTA: Vitality's dropping. Watch it carefully. Adjust cutout at twenty five. Don't reduce any lower or he may not recover.
JANO: Senta! Your message was passed on to me. You are to be congratulated.
SENTA: It's a perfect transfer.
JANO: Remarkable. How is the Doctor?
SENTA: Reduced nervous tension of course, but in good condition. Given time he will recover, and like the others, we'll be able to use him again.
JANO: You realise what this means, Senta. If we are able to achieve this transfer successfully, we will be able to do the same with the other time travellers.
SENTA: The young man and the girl.
JANO: As it is, they are a danger to us, but as a source of energy they could be of great value. Captain Edal. Send out patrols. The two young people who arrived with the Doctor must be brought in.
CHAL: Leave him. We have brought you here only for your safety.
STEVEN: What have you done for the Doctor?
CHAL: We can do nothing for him.
STEVEN: If you don't fight them, you'll always suffer.
CHAL: Obviously you have never faced the light guns.
STEVEN: What is this place? Why have we come here?
CHAL: To hide. That is where we live.
DODO: Caves? You live there?
CHAL: Yes.
STEVEN: Like animals.
CHAL: Like animals. It is the one place the guards will not follow. Even they hesitate to go into the darkness of those passages.
TOR: There is news, Chal. The patrols have been sent out. They are searching for the strangers.
DODO: How do you know they're looking for us?
TOR: They have not touched any of our people, and they are still hunting.
STEVEN: Did you hear anything about the Doctor?
TOR: He will have been used.
DODO: You mean they put him in that glass cell? Steven, what are we going to do?
STEVEN: Don't worry, Dodo, we'll find him.
CHAL: I must warn you, when you do find him he will not be as you remember. They leave us afterwards only a hollow shell of ourselves.
JANO: What is his vitality?
SENTA: It's down to twenty five. We were very careful.
JANO: And the energy count?
SENTA: That's high. As a source of energy, his power is remarkably high.
JANO: And he will recover?
SENTA: Of course, but it will take time.
JANO: Very well. And now I wish you to prepare for an in-transference.
SENTA: So soon?
JANO: The sooner the better.
SENTA: You've nominated a number of people to receive part of his life force?
JANO: No. There will be only one person.
SENTA: That's most unusual.
JANO: This is a most unusual experiment, Senta. It would not be right to jeopardise the safety of any other members of the city. I will take full responsibility.
SENTA: You're going to take the in-transference yourself?
JANO: Yes.
SENTA: But Jano, is that wise? Anything might happen. We've never seen the results of such an in-transference before.
JANO: It is for that reason that I will take the risk. I shall be ready when you need me.
EDAL: Keep to your own division, Exorse. You're too far over. This is section K4. You should be beyond the scrubland. Go and see if they've tried to reach the Valley of Caves.
EXORSE: Very good, Captain.
STEVEN: What is it?
CHAL: A patrol is coming this way.
TOR: I have warned you. they are looking for you.
DODO: Will they come here?
CHAL: Possibly.
STEVEN: Where can we go?
TOR: There is no place where you are safe.
CHAL: Be silent! You will be safe in the caves.
TOR: No, Chal! You cannot take them into the caves. The guards would follow and then our last refuge would be gone.
CHAL: They have helped us. We must help them.
TOR: No! They are not our people. They must not be allowed in the caves.
CHAL: I am the leader and I say they may go.
TOR: Very well. Our destruction will be on your hands.
CHAL: You will remain here. Come with me, quickly.
CHAL: Nanina, do not worry. They are friends.
WYLDA: They helped me.
DODO: It's beautiful. Like a little temple.
CHAL: This is where we live. It is the one spot on this island which we can call our own.
STEVEN: But who's made all this?
CHAL: Our people have done it.
STEVEN: It's superb!
CHAL: Our ancestors were great artists. As time passes, we are less able to do such things. Most of our talents have been taken from us. Only our faith remains, and that they will never take.
WYLDA: Look out. The patrol is coming.
EXORSE: Stay where you are. Where are they?
EXORSE: Next time, I will take you away. I asked you, where are the strangers?
EXORSE: Up there, are they? Right.
NANINA: What is happening?
CHAL: He is coming this way.
NANINA: Go back. I will watch.
EXORSE : You have the two strangers. Tell them to come here.
NANINA: There are no strangers.
STEVEN: Let me see what's going on.
NANINA: Stay down there!
STEVEN: How many guards?
NANINA: There's only one, but he has a gun.
DODO: What's he doing now?
NANINA: It's no use. He's coming here.
STEVEN: Isn't there any other way out of this place?
CHAL: There are the passages but they don't lead anywhere.
DODO: You mean we're trapped?
CHAL: No, no, no. They will give us a chance. There are many passages and he may not know which one to follow. Come with me.
EXORSE : This is an order. Bring out the strangers. I know they are there.
STEVEN: What will happen to him?
CHAL: They can do no worse than they have done before.
DODO: We don't want to bring any more suffering on your people.
EXORSE : Very well, I will come and get them myself.
CHAL: Quickly! This way.
EXORSE: The strangers, girl, where are they? Tell me or you will suffer.
NANINA: I will tell you nothing.
EXORSE: After I find them, I shall teach you to obey.
EXORSE: Where are they? Very well. I shall take you back in their place.
NANINA: Don't talk.
SAVAGE: They have gone into the face of the rock!
STEVEN: Shhh!
EXORSE: Which opening? Which opening? Get back!
NANINA: You have betrayed them.
SAVAGE: But he would have taken me.
DODO: Where does this lead to?
CHAL: Only further into the rocks.
DODO: There's no way out?
CHAL: No.
DODO: Listen.
STEVEN: I don't hear anything.
CHAL: I'm not sure. Come on.
DODO: Isn't there any place to hide?
CHAL: Shh. Remember the echo.
STEVEN: But she's right though. We don't stand a chance if all the passages are as narrow as this.
CHAL: I can promise nothing, but he may not follow.
STEVEN: How much more of this passage is there?
CHAL: Very little, but it is our only chance.
EXORSE : I know you are there, strangers. There is no escape for you. It will be better for you if you turn back now.
DODO: It's no good, Steven.
EXORSE : Do you hear me?
STEVEN: What's that?
CHAL: It is the last bend. After that, there is nothing.
STEVEN: Go on.
TOR: Where are they now?
WYLDA: They've gone into the rock.
TOR: And the guard?
NANINA: He has followed. He showed him the way.
TOR: Chal should not have brought the strangers here. They will punish all of us.
NANINA: But the strangers helped us.
TOR: What good is that if they make the leaders angry?
EXORSE : Come back, strangers. There is no escape.
STEVEN: Then come and get us.
CHAL: He knows we are here
STEVEN: If I can get him angry, he might do something rash. Come on, soldier boy, what are you frightened of? You've got the gun.
CHAL: He will destroy us all.
STEVEN: How will he do that?
CHAL: With the gun.
STEVEN: Tell me, how will he use it?
CHAL: What does it matter.
STEVEN: Hurry up, I've got to know. Tell me, how does it work?
CHAL: They shine the liquid light beam on us and we cannot move.
STEVEN: Does the beam reflect?
CHAL: How do you mean?
STEVEN: If the light from the gun reflects, does it still work?
CHAL: Yes, yes, I've seen it from the water of the lake.
STEVEN: Quick, Dodo, give me that mirror. Now come on, get on the floor, both of you.
CHAL: It's no use!
EXORSE : You are foolish to think you can defy me. Have the people of the caves not told you? You cannot resist us.
STEVEN: We're going to change all that, soldier boy. Come on, what are you frightened of?
EXORSE: The travellers from beyond time are indeed foolish people.
STEVEN: Keep down!
CHAL: Don't let it shine on you. Don't let it touch your eyes.
STEVEN: Quiet.
DODO: It's coming closer.
EXORSE : Now do you understand, strangers? We are masters.
CHAL: We must go. We must obey.
STEVEN: Hold him, Dodo. Hang on to him. This might just work.
CHAL: It is useless, stranger.
STEVEN: Well done, Dodo. Now for it.
EXORSE : I will give you no more orders. You will step into the light.
STEVEN: Right. Now turn. Back along the passage. Come on, move.
CHAL: He has taken the guard prisoner. It is impossible.
NANINA: They're coming back.
TOR: We should not have angered him. What will happen to us? He has taken them prisoners.
NANINA: It's the guard!
TOR: He has the gun.
NANINA: We're safe.
STEVEN: Right, tie him up. Make him a prisoner.
TOR: You can destroy the people of the city. They can destroy our enemies. The strangers must be gods.
TECH 1: Are we to release him into the outer world as with the others?
SENTA: He is not one of the savages. He couldn't look after himself. No, he will be kept here. The Elders intended to give him the guest apartments. He must be taken there. Assist him. Treat him with great care. He is most valuable to us.
TECH 1: I understand, Senta.
JANO: You are ready?
SENTA: Yes. I've sent my assistants away.
JANO: You are right. It is most important that we keep this in-transference secret until we know the results. I don't wish to alarm anyone.
SENTA: Shall we begin?
JANO: I am ready.
SENTA: May all go well. I shall switch on when you give me the signal.
TOR: We should kill him while we have the chance.
STEVEN: He's more use to us alive.
TOR: They have killed many of our people. It will be justice.
NANINA: Leave him.
TOR: Why do you pity him, Nanina? This is the guard that took you. Think what they do even now to the old man.
STEVEN: And if we're quick we may still be able to help the Doctor..
TOR: It is too late. There is nothing we can
CHAL: Be silent! What do you wish us to do?
STEVEN: Show us how to get into the city.
CHAL: There is a way, but it is dangerous. It is always guarded.
STEVEN: I can handle the guards with this. Just show me how to get in.
NANINA: And once you're in?
STEVEN: Dodo and I can find the Doctor.
CHAL: Do you know where he is?
DODO: We were supposed to go to the guest apartments.
NANINA: It will not be possible.
STEVEN: We must try.
CHAL: Very well, I will show you. But we must hurry.
STEVEN: Guard your prisoner. Make sure he doesn't get away.
NANINA: Good luck go with you.
TOR: The safest way to deal with him is to kill him now.
NANINA: You heard what Chal said! I shall call him back!
NANINA: Has he hurt you?
EXORSE: Not much.
NANINA: Let me see. I shall make sure it is clean.
EXORSE: You're the girl I brought into the laboratory.
NANINA: Yes.
EXORSE: Why did you stop him?
NANINA: It would do no good to kill you.
EXORSE: What is your name?
NANINA: Nanina.
EXORSE: I shall remember.
CHAL: The entrance is there. It opens into a passage which leads to the laboratory.
STEVEN: Can you be sure?
CHAL: Oh, yes. It is the way we leave when they have taken our strength away.
DODO: Get down.
STEVEN: He doesn't look as though he expected trouble.
CHAL: Our people have been oppressed for so long the guards have grown careless.
STEVEN: All right, we'll make use of that. How close in do I have to go before this becomes effective?
CHAL: Just a little further.
STEVEN: Right. You two stay here.
GUARD: Hello, there? Is that you, Exorse?
STEVEN: Dodo, Chal!
STEVEN: Get his gun.
CHAL: Switch off your light.
DODO: He's flat out.
CHAL: The light must have hit his eyes. It is as if he was struck by a club. He will be like this for a long time.
STEVEN: How do we open the door?
CHAL: It's simple.
STEVEN: Right. Chal, take this fellow up into the bushes. We don't want anyone to find him here. Then wait for us.
CHAL: What will you do?
STEVEN: Dodo and I are going inside.
SENTA: In-transference completed. Pressure restored. Are you all right, Jano? Jano!
SENTA: Jano?
SENTA: Are you all right, Jano?
SENTA: For a moment I was afraid that
JANO: Hmm? What's all the fuss about? I'm quite all right. The trouble with you people on this planet is that you don't
SENTA: What do you mean, Jano? You belong to this planet. You're one of us.
JANO: One of? Yes, yes of course. I'm afraid I'm not quite myself.
SENTA: I understand. You must rest, Jano. I shall give instructions that you're not to be disturbed.
JANO: Hmm! An excellent idea. After an experience like that, one takes time to become adjusted. I suppose my two young friends
SENTA: Avon and Flower?
JANO: Good gracious, no, no, no. Steven and Dodo, the child with the ridiculous name.
SENTA: The strangers?
JANO: Oh, strangers to you, perhaps, but I have known them both for
JANO: Yes, yes, of course. The strangers.
SENTA: I will leave you, Jano.
JANO: Hmm! So, I'm in this dreadful place, am I? Well, I'll soon do something about their equipment.
JANO: What's happened to me? What's happened to me?
DODO: Steven, there's something wrong. It shouldn't be so easy to get in.
STEVEN: Chal and his people will be too terrified to break in.
DODO: Surely they should have some security?
STEVEN: Maybe they thought one guard was enough.
EDAL: They're not going to give us much trouble. Just a little bit further and they'll have no chance to get back.
SENTA: It looks as though they're stopping.
DODO: Steven, there's something strange. I don't want to go on.
STEVEN: It's our only chance. We've got to find the Doctor.
DODO: Listen.
EDAL: We just have to coax them in a little.
EDAL: Hello, guest apartment control. Captain Edal speaking. Conduct time traveller number one to the end of emergency corridor U3.
EDAL : You are to leave the Doctor there by himself. Take him there immediately. This is urgent.
DODO: This is the corridor I was in before. There's a T junction just ahead.
STEVEN: Can we get into the laboratory that way?
DODO: Yes.
STEVEN: Come on.
DODO: All right.
GUARD : Time traveller number one in position.
EDAL: Good. Release him. Stay out of sight until I give the signal.
DODO: Here's the T junction all right.  There's someone there!
STEVEN: Yes, you're right. Stand by.
STEVEN + DODO: Doctor!
DODO: Oh, it's wonderful to see you.
STEVEN: Doctor, are you all right? How did you get here?
DODO: Why doesn't he answer?
STEVEN: Are you all right, Doctor?  Come on. We're going to get you out of this place.
DODO: He's not moving. Steven, give him a hand.
STEVEN: What was that?
DODO: The door!
STEVEN: Dodo, quickly!
STEVEN: Doctor, come on now. You can get through!
DODO: Steven, I can't hold on much longer.
STEVEN: Doctor! Doctor!
DODO: What have they done to you?
EDAL: Guards to emergency corridor U3. Use destructive vapours as protection against the light guns. Move up behind.
DODO: Look!
STEVEN: There's someone behind it!
DODO: That's no good, Steven. We've got to get out of here.
DODO: Oh, quickly, Steven. It's getting nearer.
DODO: I can't see anything.
STEVEN: We've got to go through it, Dodo.
DODO: I can't.
STEVEN: Come on, Dodo.
DODO: I can't.
Episode 4
STEVEN: It's no good, Dodo. I'm sorry.
DODO: Help me, Steven. This stuff is choking me.
EDAL: Throw the light guns into the vapour.
STEVEN: No, don't, Dodo!
DODO: Steven, I can't breathe. Do as he says.
STEVEN: You fool!
EDAL: The other light gun. Throw it immediately.
DODO: Steven, give him the gun.
JANO: No, don't, my boy. Don't give it to them.
DODO: Steven, look! The doors are opening.
STEVEN: Quick, Dodo. Get the Doctor out!
DODO: What about you?
STEVEN: Do as I say. Don't worry about me.
DODO: Come on, Doctor.
STEVEN: Come on. Right, now you get back!
SENTA: What happened? Did they escape?
EDAL: Who opened the doors?
SENTA: Someone has helped the strangers to escape. Give the alarm!
EDAL: You! You opened the doors.
JANO: Don't be ridiculous, young man. Why would I do that? You seem to forget that I am in charge here. Why would I do anything to help our enemies?
EDAL: Well, no, but if you didn't do it
JANO: If? Kindly remember to whom you are speaking. I am.  Get back to your work, Captain.
EDAL: What about the strangers? You want us to go after them?
JANO: The strangers? Oh yes. Yes, instruct B Patrol to make ready.
EDAL: I'll take charge of them myself.
JANO: No, Captain, you will not. I will lead the patrol.
DODO: Doctor, please. You must try to go on. Oh, please try. Is there any sign?
STEVEN: No, not yet, but they're bound to be following.
DODO: Oh come on, Doctor. Come on.
STEVEN: It's no good.
DODO: Doesn't he care what happens?
STEVEN: He doesn't even know.
DODO: Look out!
STEVEN: It's all right, it's Chal.
CHAL: How did you get him away? I did not think it was possible.
DODO: Look at the state he's in.
CHAL: Yes, I've seen many of our people like that. That is how they leave us.
STEVEN: Will he recover?
CHAL: Yes, but it takes time.
STEVEN: Where can we hide him, Chal?
CHAL: No place is safe, but it's best to take him to the caves.
STEVEN: Quickly, they're right behind us. Chal, you and Dodo, get the Doctor to the caves. I'll try and hold them back.
DODO: But what can you do?
STEVEN: I can delay them for a little while. Now, go on. You're going to need all the time you can get.
DODO: Good luck, Steven.
JANO: That way. The strangers may have done one of two things, Captain. They may have tried to get back to their spaceship, or they may have gone on to the Valley of Caves. I suggest we split up. Take two men and see if the strangers have tried to reach their machine. I will go on to the Valley.
EDAL: You two, guard the strangers' space machine.
JANO: You are not going with them?
EDAL: I will come with you, Jano. I think you may need my help.
JANO: Very well.
EDAL: Look out!
JANO: How dare
EDAL: The strangers! Just one of them. He's over there behind those rocks. We'll have to split up and work round the side of him. You take that side, and I'll take this. Jano, you can watch him from here.
JANO: Right.
DODO: Will Steven be all right?
CHAL: Who can tell? He is a brave man.
DODO: Are we nearly there?
CHAL: It's not far to the Valley of the Caves.
DODO: If only the Doctor would move faster.
CHAL: You must understand he's not himself. It's as though he were asleep still. Help him. Do not be angry with him.
DODO: I'm sorry.
JANO: What happened?
EDAL: He's not here. He's playing for time. The longer he can delay us, the more chance they've got of getting the Doctor to the caves.
JANO: Look out, Edal!
EDAL: Come on!
NANINA: Drink this.
EXORSE: Thank you.
NANINA: Let me see your head.
EXORSE: I'm all right.
TOR: It's a pity I didn't kill him when I had the chance. People of his kind must be destroyed if there is to be any hope for the rest of us.
NANINA: We will not save ourselves that way, Tor.
TOR: You hear her? Nanina protects our enemies. This is a dangerous man. What do we do, let him go so he may attack us again? Or do we get rid of our enemies to help ourselves?
NANINA: Chal is our leader. He and the strangers have given us orders that this man is not to be hurt.
TOR: I never trust the strangers, and Chal is not here.
NANINA: All right, Tor. I am here.
TOR: You would fight for this man, Nanina? How can an enemy mean so much?
CHAL : Tor, where are you?
NANINA: It's Chal!
CHAL : Where's the guard?
CHAL: Help him.
NANINA: Where is the other stranger?
CHAL: He will come.
EDAL: How did he get away?
JANO: You must ask your guards.
EDAL: We will be too late. They will be in the valley by now.
DODO: There's someone coming! It's Steven.
STEVEN: Get him inside, quick! They're right behind me.
EDAL: There they are. Fire!
STEVEN: Get him into the back of the cave, quick, and give him some of those capsules.
DODO: Which capsules?
STEVEN: Those that we gave to the savage.
DODO: Yes, I forgot.
STEVEN: Somebody's moving.
CHAL: It's their leader, Jano.
TOR: Quickly, fire now. Shoot!
DOCTOR: Not at Jano.
STEVEN: Doctor, what are you doing?
DOCTOR: You must not harm Jano.
TOR: But he is their leader.
DOCTOR: Please carry out my instructions, and do not harm Jano.
TOR: It is too late now.
CHAL: Yes. Take him down.
DODO: Doctor.
STEVEN: Here, take this. Go on, take it!
STEVEN: Don't use it unless you have to.
DODO: Are you all right, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so, my dear. I must have fallen into some kind of a coma. It was as though, as though all my powers were being sapped.
CHAL: You have let their leader escape.
DOCTOR: Where am I? Where am I?
STEVEN: These are the cave dwellings where Chal and his people live.
DODO: We've got to get back to the Tardis.
DOCTOR: No. No, my dear, no, no, we can't leave yet. No, we've got a lot of work to do.
STEVEN: Work?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I don't intend to leave these people in this oppressed state.
STEVEN: Well, you're never going to convince the elders that Chal and his people should be treated like human beings.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're probably right, my boy. I shan't even try.
CHAL: Well what are you going to do?
DOCTOR: I am going to destroy the power that they hold over you.
STEVEN: Destroy the laboratory?
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely.
STEVEN: But how are we going to get in? They'll be waiting for us this time.
DOCTOR: All we need is one friend from the other side.
NANINA: But that is not possible.
DOCTOR: I think we have him already, my dear.
JANO: It is getting dark. I want you to return to the city.
EDAL: Leave you here alone?
JANO: Yes. I shall be all right.
EDAL: I can't do that. I refuse to.
JANO: I am still your leader, Edal, and this is an order. Tell Senta and the elders that I shall return with the strangers as prisoners.
EDAL: I obey, under protest.
STEVEN: They've gone.
DOCTOR: All of them?
STEVEN: It's hard to tell. It's too dark.
DOCTOR: Yes, I think you will find they've left one behind.
STEVEN: I'll stay on guard.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, there's no need to, my boy.
CHAL: You speak in riddles. You say they have left one behind, but we do not need a guard? I, I
DOCTOR: That is correct. We'll wait until it's dark, and then I think we shall have a visitor.
SENTA: But you shouldn't have left him there, Edal.
EDAL: I was forced to. He's acting very strangely. He's not at all himself.
SENTA: Are you sure?
EDAL: Jano has changed.
SENTA: That's a dangerous accusation to make.
SENTA: Dare you repeat it in front of them?
EDAL: I was ordered to return here by Jano. Elders, I believe we are about to be betrayed.
DODO: There's someone coming.
DOCTOR: There's no need for that, my boy.
STEVEN: Doctor.
DOCTOR: Shush, shush, shush, shush.
JANO : Don't be alarmed. Is the Doctor there?
CHAL: It is Jano.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am here, Jano. We were expecting you.
DOCTOR: Tell your people they are quite safe, Chal. Jano comes as a friend.
CHAL: Do not be afraid. We must trust this man.
JANO: How do you know that I come as a friend?
DOCTOR: Oh, my dear Jano, it wasn't difficult. I knew you were to undergo the in-transference yourself.
JANO: You knew that?
DOCTOR: Yes, an unknown experiment. And you're not the type of man to allow others to take risks.
JANO: You're right, Doctor. And now tell me, what has happened to me?
DOCTOR: It's all very simple. You wanted my intellect. You got it, and along with it, you received a little conscience.
STEVEN: Conscience?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. You see, Jano is now saddled with the sense of right and wrong, which makes him an explosive element in a civilisation such as his.
STEVEN: Is this true?
JANO: It must be. All I know is that since the experiment I have not been sure of myself. I have grown aware of the evil that we have done and I am determined to end it.
CHAL: You are going to help us?
JANO: Yes.
TOR: Your friends would never agree.
JANO: I know. I will not try to persuade them.
DOCTOR: Jano has another plan.
JANO: How did you know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I think it's like mine.
CHAL: Hold him!
STEVEN: He's gone.
TOR: If he gets back, that will be the end of your fine plan.
DOCTOR: We must take that chance.
TOR: Nanina!
EXORSE: Why did you follow?
NANINA: If you betray Jano, what will become of us?
EXORSE: It is Jano who is the traitor.
NANINA: What have you learnt, Exorse? That we are people like yourselves. What chance will we ever have if you speak.
EXORSE: You think I can keep silent about what I've heard?
NANINA: You owe me your life, Exorse. I have a right to ask you. If you are against us now, you condemn us forever.
SENTA: I promised Jano that I would tell no-one about the in-transference, but now I must. It appears that Jano has absorbed dangerous ideas from the Doctor. What can we do?
EDAL: We can no longer trust Jano. He is not fit to lead us. I will take command. Declare an emergency. We must be ready for Jano.
JANO: Everyone must do as I command. You too, Doctor. No one will turn back. And now we must move.
EDAL: You were a prisoner in the cave?
EXORSE: That is correct.
EDAL: Jano. I left him there alone. He had some plan.
EXORSE: I did not see him.
SENTA: According to Captain Edal, Jano is no longer to be trusted. He has gone over to the savages.
JANO: Come on, get a move on there. Come on, get along.
JANO: Come on.
EDAL: Are you sure, Exorse, you have nothing further to report?
EXORSE: Nothing, Captain.
EDAL: Strange, very strange. We'll see what the interrogators can get out of you.
EXORSE: Only the leader has the right to send citizens to the interr
SENTA: Captain Edal has called an emergency. He has taken over the leadership in the absence of Jano.
JANO: In the absence of Jano?
SENTA: We did not expect you back here.
JANO: Why not? Did I not say that I would be back with prisoners. Bring in the strangers.
SENTA: So you were wrong, Edal. Captain Edal informed us that you had gone over to the enemy, Jano. He has tried to take your place.
JANO: Put the Captain under arrest. Both of you.
EDAL: I demand to be heard.
JANO: You will be heard at the right time and place. Take him away.
SENTA: We apologise, Jano. We thought that something had happened to you during the in-transference.
JANO: Seal off the doors.
SENTA: Are we to prepare these savages for transference?
JANO: Seal off the doors.
SENTA: What's happening? I insist upon knowing.
JANO: You will find what I going to say very difficult to understand. All the Elders of our city are here, and so is the source of our supremacy on this planet. No man easily gives up the means which give him power.
SENTA: I don't understand you, Jano.
JANO: That is what I am asking you to do. I want you to destroy all this.
SENTA: What? The laboratory? The generators?
JANO: All the machinery which we have used to destroy our fellows.
SENTA: They are not our fellows, Jano. They are the savages. They are not capable of development like us.
JANO: How do you know?
SENTA: All history proves it. The savages are good only to provide us with energy. The laboratory must not be destroyed.
JANO: These people whom you call savages are our equals. What we have done to them is wrong. If you will not destroy all this, then I must.
SENTA: What are you doing? Stop him!
JANO: This is our only chance to start life afresh on this planet. Help me!
SENTA: Well, don't just stand there! Use your gun.
NANINA: Help, Exorse. It's the only way to help us all.
EDAL: Open the doors! We cannot get in.
DOCTOR: You know, my dear, there's something very satisfying in destroying something that's evil, don't you think?
DODO: Yes!
JANO: This is only the beginning, Chal. After this destruction, our people must learn to build a world that they can both live in.
CHAL: And both sides must learn to trust each other.
JANO: We may need a new leader. Somebody who can unite us.
EDAL : Make sure the strangers don't escape. It is they who have done this to us! Kill the Doctor on sight. These are my orders!
EDAL: Get Jano! Arrest him.
STEVEN: Stay where you are! What can you do now? The place is destroyed. Your power's gone.
EDAL: You! I should have killed you a long time ago. And you, Doctor. You have done this to us.
JANO: Edal, you have no more authority here.
EDAL: You. You are a traitor. I do not take orders from traitors!
STEVEN: Drop it!
JANO: Doctor, we already owe you much.  And now I owe you my life.
DOCTOR: Jano, since you have destroyed the power you held over Chal and his people, you realise now of course, you've got to learn to live together.
JANO: Yes, but the fear and hatred of the past will only die slowly. We need someone like yourself as a mediator until we have become one people.
DOCTOR: I see. But in my case I'm afraid that is utterly impossible.
JANO: The man we need must inspire trust. His judgements must come from his heart, even more than his head.
CHAL: Here is the leader we want, Jano.
JANO: This is what I thought.
STEVEN: Just a minute. I couldn't.
DOCTOR: A great honour, dear boy.
STEVEN: But I can't walk out on you and Dodo!
DOCTOR: Just think of the challenge to be able to set up the people of this planet for a new life. You're quite ready for this task.
STEVEN: You think I can do it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. And you're the only man who can, my boy.
STEVEN: Has the offer come from both sides?
CHAL: You would give us new hope. Our people will become great again. We will learn to live as equals without bitterness.
STEVEN: What about Tor?
TOR: I should accept your decisions.
STEVEN: Very well. I will stay.
CHAL: Thank you, thank you.  And thank you. You have justified our faith.
DODO: Oh, Steven.
STEVEN: I shall miss you both, Dodo.
DODO: I shall miss you.
JANO: Doctor, for many light years we looked forward to your arrival on this planet. We always knew of your wisdom, but we never dreamed of the miracle that it would bring us.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jano. And if ever you need the benefit of my wisdom again, I trust and hope you will allow me to express myself with my own free will, rather than place me in an oven, and try and cook it out of me.
JANO: Come, Chal, we must summon our people. There is much work to be done. We shall await you in our Council Chamber.
DOCTOR: Well, I must say, young man, I'm very proud of you.
STEVEN: Doctor, I don't know if I
DOCTOR: I know, I know, my boy. Well, go on, you mustn't keep them waiting.
STEVEN: Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Steven, and good luck.
DODO: Doctor, do you think we'll ever see him again?
DOCTOR: Well, who knows, my dear. In this strange complex of time and space, anything can happen. Come along, little one. We must go. We mustn't look back.
